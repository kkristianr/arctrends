10.1177/19375867231177304,Application of the Childbirth Supporter Study to Advance the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool,2024,"Objective: Translational research to advance design criteria and apply the Childbirth Supporter Study (CSS) findings to practice. Background: The physical design of birth environments has not undergone substantial improvements in layout or ambiance since the initial move to hospitals. Cooperative, continuously present childbirth supporters are beneficial and are an expectation for most modern birth practices, yet the built environment does not offer support for the supporter. Methods: To advance design criteria, we use a comparative case study approach to create translational findings. Specifically, CSS findings were used as indicators to advance the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET) design characteristics in pursuit of better support for childbirth supporters in the built hospital birth environment. Results: This comparative case study provides eight new BUDSET design domain suggestions to benefit the supporter-woman dyad, and subsequently the baby and care providers. Conclusions: Research-informed design imperatives are needed to guide the inclusion of childbirth supporters as both a supporter and as an individual in the birth space. Increased understanding of relationships between specific design features and childbirth supporters’ experiences and reactions are provided. Suggestions to enhance the applicability of the BUDSET for birth unit design facility development are made, specifically ones that will better accommodate childbirth supporters. © The Author(s) 2023.","There are well-recognized benefits for both
mother and baby when the woman receives support from a chosen birth companion as reflected
in Cochrane reviews (Bohren et al., 2017; Hodnett et al., 2013) and by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), yet we claim a dichotomy
in current birth environment design exists which
does not reflect this knowledge. While in most
resource-rich nations, a continuous supporter is
expected to accompany the woman throughout
her labor and birth experience, the supporter is
usually not well accommodated in the birth space
(Johansson et al., 2015, Minnie et al., 2018) and
subsequently may be unable to function effectively in their support role.
In their role, supporters often feel overwhelmed, anxious, or uncertain (Gawlik et al.,
2015). Although recent design guidelines show
an awareness of supporters’ importance, it
appears supporters have been overlooked when
it comes to birth environment design (Harte
et al., 2016).
Although recent design guidelines show
an awareness of supporters’ importance,
it appears supporters have been
overlooked when it comes to birth
environment design (Harte et al., 2016).
Hospital culture, sociocultural and material/
technological context are interwoven influences
(Maffi, 2016) affecting this claim. Healthcare
settings are inherently complex spaces that
provide endless challenges for designers to
accommodate all necessary delivery of care
components (van Hoof et al., 2015). Within
architectural and design practice, the demand for
efficient execution of each commission allows
few opportunities for user-based research
(Andrade et al., 2012); therefore, it is important
that rigorous research findings are regularly
incorporated into design practice.
Design assessment tools, akin to guidelines,
are both embraced and resisted by practitioners
who dislike the prescriptive “checklist”
approach while also needing to incorporate the
latest best-practice evidence-based design
knowledge into their project within the budgeted
time frame (Brambilla et al., 2019; Moore et al.,
2015). This tension of bringing evidence into
practice is an ongoing effort and opportunity for
improvement on the part of environment design
behavior researchers, as well as for many other
design and architectural fields (Forsythe, 2018).
We join others to claim evidence-based design is
a key design process for childbirth environment
design, especially for patient comfort and reducing stress (Brambilla et al., 2019; O’Callaghan
et al., 2019).
Aim
The aim of this comparative case study is twofold: (1) to present research-informed design principles developed from the video-ethnographic
Childbirth Supporter Study (CSS; Harte et al.,
2016) and based on the comparison of these results
(2) to discuss and suggest refinements to the Birth
Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET
version October 2, 2010), the leading assessment
tool for physical birth environments to better
reflect the needs of childbirth supporters in hospital contexts.
The Study Case Setting
and Context
The research presented here is a comparative
case study, which will be explained further in
the Method section. The two cases compared are
the CSS (Harte et al., 2016) and the BUDSET
(version October 2, 2010; Foureur, Leap, et al.,
2010; Foureur et al., 2011). The CSS is an
empirical study conducted as part of a doctoral
dissertation (Harte, 2015), while the BUDSET is
both a conceptual and empirical pilot research
Harte et al. 149
study (Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al.,
2011). Both CSS and BUDSET occurred in Australia between 2011 and 2016, while the comparative case study research presented here,
which is both empirical and theoretical, occurred
between 2015 and 2022.
We draw on research into the experiences of
childbirth supporters from the CSS (Harte et al.,
2016) to initiate discussion around the inclusion
of supporter needs in birth environment design.
We use the BUDSET as a second case to compare
the CSS results to, as a technique for improving
the BUDSET, with the goal of facilitating
improved experiences for childbirth supporters.
We refer to Version 2.0 developed in 2010
throughout this article. For an abbreviated BUDSET, see Table S1 in the Online Supplements.
To lay the groundwork for the comparative
case study, we first provide a brief background
of childbirth supporters in the designed birth
space, the theoretical framework and the methods
used for the CSS, and an overview of the BUDSET before turning our attention to the comparative case study.
Supporters in the Designed Birth
Environment
Supporters, for this research, are defined as
untrained companions from the woman’s personal network (Harte, 2015). Professional supporters may also benefit from the results
presented here, however; they are not the focus.
Birth supporter’s roles include many activities,
including physical comfort and touch (for
instance, massage, wiping the woman’s forehead,
holding her hand, providing ice chips/water;
Johansson et al., 2012). Psychological and affective support (both overt and covert) are equally
important, including verbal encouragement, eye
contact, and active listening and positive response
to expressions of pain or fear the woman may
convey (Johansson et al., 2012).
The softer aspects of care can be facilitated
with reimagined birth spaces harmoniously rich
with sensory, color, and light/dark patterns that
foster a supportive atmosphere (Balabanoff,
2017). A range of accommodation types enable
the supporter to regulate their participation type
and level, with confidence in assisting at the birth,
as shown in the scoping review of eight crucial
building spaces in maternity care (Setola et al.,
2019).
Theoretical Frameworks
As this comparative case study is centered on the
CSS as a central axis, or case, the following
briefly describes the CSS theoretical framework
and analysis technique. The theoretical underpinnings, methods and research design for CSS are
described in detail in related publications (Harte
et al., 2017; Harte et al., 2014). The CSS comprises ethnography (as both a research collection
technique and as a theory), “birth territory” theory (Fahy et al., 2008; Fahy & Parratt, 2006), and
the “safe, satisfying birth” hypothesis (Foureur,
Davis, et al., 2010) to support the data collection
method, while symbolic interactionism (Blumer,
1986; Prus, 1996) and a thematic coding
approach informed by both Saldan˜a (2013) and
the activities, environment, interactions, objects
and users (AEIOU) framework originally developed by Wasson (2000) guided the data
interpretation.
The above-described theoretical framework
grounds the CSS and supports the process for the
comparative case study, while the comparative
case study adopts the additional theoretical
framework of critical theory. Broadening the
view of each case to include the phenomena in
question—how better to support childbirth supporters in the design environment—the comparative case study attends to power and inequality,
informed by Marxist, feminist, and critical race
theory (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017). Questioning the
evidence with a “meaning-making,” theoretical
stance is a hallmark for the comparative case
study approach, as it facilitates both an
unbounded frame and active iteration to progress
the complex field of birth environment design.
Case 1: The Childbirth Supporter
Study
This and the following section describe the cases
compared. The first case is the CSS and the
second case is the BUDSET. The CSS is a
150 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1)
video-ethnographic case study of one family’s
experience. This included eight participants (one
woman, her partner and three family supporters,
plus three midwives), 1-hr of video footage from
15 hr of labor, observational field notes, and five
postnatal video-cued interviews. CSS is a substudy of the larger birth unit design (BUD) study
conducted in hospital birth units in Australia
between 2011 and 2015. Both studies received
ethical approval (HREC/10/HAWKE/135 and
SSA/10/SG/190).
The CSS study was a focused, short-term ethnographic study that used thick description to
provide sufficient evidence and context for the
“reader to evaluate the extent and truth of the
phenomenon under investigation and how it may
resonate with other environments, circumstances,
and people (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)” (Harte et al.,
2016).
Video-ethnography is an ethnographic technique that uses video of the participants engaged
in the experience in question to observe complex
lived experiences (“the data”), which then
enables deeper reflection on the part of the participants and the researchers. In the CSS study, the
video-reflexive ethnographic data collection consisted of unobtrusive labor recording, followed by
postpartum interviews conducted while viewing
the footage, to explore the participants’ experiences and the meanings they attribute to their
experiences in the designed space. The participants were invited to view the video, being aware
of the researcher’s intention to activate a reflexive process.
In the CSS study, reflexivity was practiced in
two shared but different ways by the researcher
and by the participants. Reflexivity is a process
of stepping back from the data to view it with a
personal recognition as to one’s place in the
experience to enable the data to be interpreted
in a systematic and layered way (Darawsheh,
2014; Palaganas et al., 2017). The researcher
practiced a reflexive stance with an aim to gain
honest and open assessment of multiple aspects,
for instance, their personal station and values,
while the participants were also invited to practice a reflexive stance in the act of watching the
video—to interpret their actions based on
multiple aspects, for instance, their memories
and feelings as well as novel observations.
All CSS study participant names are pseudonyms. Felicity, the woman in labor, aimed for a
natural, unmedicated labor. Felicity’s mother,
Frances, acted as her main supporter for most of
the labor. Although Frances acted as Felicity’s
main supporter, Felicity’s partner, Martin, was
available as needed to provide support. Felicity’s
two sisters also occupied the birth environment
and provided support in varying (lesser) degrees.
Three midwives present at various points of the
labor provided contextual evidence to facilitate
ethnographic understanding.
Three themes were identified in the CSS
analysis: an “unbelonging paradox,” “role
navigation,” and “supporting the supporter”
(Harte et al., 2016). Eight subthemes characterize
these three themes as seen in Harte et al. (2016).
Design characteristics to facilitate optimal BUD
have previously been proposed in the BUDSET
(Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al., 2011;
Sheehy et al., 2011). We will now provide further
contextual background for BUDSET.
Case 2: BUDSET
An important research component that supported
the development of the CSS was the presence of a
physical birth spatial design audit tool, the BUDSET. The original BUDSET tool serves as the
second case for this comparative case study
report. Upon completion by birth unit caregivers,
staff, designers, or related people, the BUDSET
enables a valid and reliable audit of physical
childbirth environments in terms of the quality
of the built spaces, including the objects within
them, specifically from the perspective of a target
group of women’s experiences.
It may clarify the relationship between BUDSET and the CSS findings to picture the entire
birthing journey as both a series of physical
movements through physical space, as well as a
psychological journey outside of space (and time)
for the woman and her supporter(s). Optimally,
the woman and her chosen supporter synergize as
a cooperative dyad.
The BUDSET has four domains, which serve
to assess design factors contributing to the “fear
Harte et al. 151
cascade” cycle (Stenglin & Foureur, 2013),
including the attributes of “facility,” “aesthetics”
of the space, and “support” for family and friends
(Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010). These domains are
comprised of 18 characteristics—the design
principles.
Results of a pilot test indicate that the BUDSET is a viable tool for “assess[ing] the optimality of birth units... [and to] determine which
domain areas may need improvement” (Foureur
et al., 2011, p. 36). Other studies confirm content
validity for the original target group of women,
while proposing the opportunity for refinements
to better reflect the experiences of diverse groups,
midwives, and supporters (Menke et al., 2018;
Sheehy et al., 2011).
Comparative Case Study Methods
The research presented here uses the comparative
case study approach (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017), an
empirical approach to making extended meaning
of two or more cases. We present, framed with
theory, the relationship of the CSS findings as
compared with the BUDSET design recommendations. Similarly, the BUDSET is compared to
the CSS to demonstrate the relevance, applicability, and validity of the CSS study.
The strength of the comparative case study
method is the ability for the researcher to attend
to simultaneous and overlapping axes, as
described by Bartlett and Vavrus (2017). Specifically, the “horizontal, which compares how similar ... phenomena unfold in locations that are
connected and socially produced; vertical, which
traces phenomena across scales; and transversal,
which traces phenomena and cases across time”
(p. 15). It is important to understand the need for
context to not be solely defined “as place or location, but ...should rather be conceptualized as
something spatial and relational” (p. 15).
Additionally, the comparative case study
method “eschew(s) a static, bounded notion of
culture in favor of a view of culture as an
on-going, contested production” (Bartlett and
Vavrus, 2017, p. 15). This method supports the
extension of an existing spatial evaluation tool
via comparative superimposition of ethnographic
results. The comparative case study method as
promoted by Bartlett and Vavrus works in an
iterative way to trace relevant and contingent
actors, both human and nonhuman, to achieve
“a sense of shared place, purpose, or identity with
regard to the central phenomenon” (p. 10), which
in our case is the support of childbirth supporters
in the designed environment.
Analysis Process
As there are important design practice suggestions (also called design imperatives) revealed
by the CSS, so too design imperatives are also
included as the spine of the BUDSET. The comparative case study approach was conducted
using a line-by-line comparison of all CSS findings, as reported in Harte et al. (2016), overlayed
directly to each BUDSET characteristics. The
aim was to authenticate fit, utility, validity, reliability, rigor, and trustworthiness for both cases
(Miles et al., 2018), as meaningful to design scholars, childbirth design evidence-creation, and
design practitioners.
Because BUDSET was developed prior to the
CSS study, there is a gap we argue should be
addressed, to strengthen BUDSET by more completely including the needs of childbirth supporter(s). The BUDSET characteristics are evident in
the CSS findings, as the CSS findings also
demonstrate the relevance of the BUDSET characteristics. Each component of each data set
(BUDSET and CSS) was taken in turn and compared to each of the other set of components by
the first author and later verified as accurate by
the coauthors. Narrative examples of this process
follow in the Findings section.
The complete comparative case study is presented in Table S2 as a online supplementary file,
as a technique to demonstrate the iterative suggestions to better include supporters within the
existing BUDSET, Version 2.0. All 18 BUDSET
domains are stated, followed by CSS findings to
highlight supporters’ needs within the design as
related to the BUDSET characteristic. The degree
to which the BUDSET characteristics are
reflected within the CSS study are indicated as
either strong, mixed, or limited to the degree in
which the listed items were relevant and matched
to the CSS participants’ experience, either as
152 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1)
example or as counter example. For instance, if
the ability to adjust lights is a BUDSET characteristic, and this ability was absent but desired by
the CSS participants, it is listed as mixed.
The analysis highlights BUDSET aspects that
account for supporters, and areas where the CSS
suggests a need for development of supporters’
design-related needs. First, we provide contextual
information about BUDSET, followed by two
examples of how design elements participated
in the childbirth supporters’ experiences.
BUDSET Domains Related to Supporters
One further proviso, before describing examples,
is that a person’s perception of their experiences
is true for them, while—in the case of supporter’s—this self-perception may not transfer into
the most optimal behavior to facilitate labor. This
article aims to provide context for suggested
future and more nuanced research. A further
research question that could be posed is, do
design features play a mediating role, or do they
have a moderating role in clarifying supporters’
self-perceptions of their activities—while also
improving the actual supporter role?
As reported in the CSS (Harte et al., 2016),
supporters have two parallel sets of needs:
(1) to provide support for the woman and (2) (to
have assistance in) managing the physical and
emotional demands of their role. Implicated
within these two roles, which we call “engaged”
and “waiting,” although neither term is exclusive,
are both sets of supporter’s needs: to support the
woman and to be supported in attending to their
own well-being.
As reported in the CSS (Harte et al.,
2016), supporters have two parallel sets of
needs: (1) to provide support for the
woman and (2) (to have assistance in)
managing the physical and emotional
demands of their role.
With a finer grained comparative case lens, we
now examine BUDSET as reflected in the CSS
findings while the CSS findings are simultaneously assessed as reflected in the BUDSET characteristics. A few examples are identified to
demonstrate this relationship, with design
imperatives identified"
10.23750/abm.v94iS3.14283,Evaluation of stakeholder opinion about Long-Term Care facilities for people with dementia perceived quality: a web-based survey in the Italian context,2023,"Background and aim: Italy is a country where the percentage of the elderly population is very high (23% over 65). The investigation aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC). Methods: This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The questions were identified after exploring an analysis of recent European case studies. The survey has been submitted to a panel of stakeholders (us-ers, practitioners, designers, and managers in the healthcare sector). It is articulated in eight items touching on functional, configurational, and perceptual aspects of the LTC. Results: The 210 responses provided a basis for comparison with the trend lines detected by the case study analysis, establishing continuity on some con-figurational aspects and providing divergent views for others. The research found a strong need to introduce new service activities and technologies targeted at caring for and assisting guests with dementia. These specific requirements commonly require the development of new spaces and environments or the redefinition of the same, where already present. Conclusions: The results highlight that a new model of residence must incorpo-rate new technological applications, and outdoor spaces, that are perceived significantly by both patients and practitioners and therefore improve the well-being of all users.

World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1).
Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2).
This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,
 
learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD.
It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented
 

 

as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5).
In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6).
The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,
 

and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7).
Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns.
There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,
 


 

Figure 1. The comparison of the bed numbers of LTC between 2010 and 2020 (Eurostat).
 

 

that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14).
Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related.
In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).

1.1	Research gap

In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research.
There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have.
The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of
 

fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).

2.	Materials and methods

This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research.
The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users.
A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy.
The survey consists of:

1.	identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development)
2.	choice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition)
3.	processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)

The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare
 

 

facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.

2.1	Assessment framework development from the case study analysis

The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing
- thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).

2.2	Web-based survey definition

The survey was divided into 4 parts:

1.	The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only.
2.	The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.
 

3.	The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question.
Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD.
The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development:
-	location,
-	shared spaces,
-	paths,
-	living areas,
-	external spaces,
-	technologies,
-	bedrooms.
4.	In the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.

2.3. Data collection and analysis

The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible.
The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...).
It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer.
The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.

3.	Results

The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.

The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid.
The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined.
This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces.
Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.
 

3.1.	Section 1 – Statistical data

The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).

3.2.	Location

The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).
 
3.3.	General aspects

As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about
10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development.
However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.

Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
3.4.	Distribution

56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8).
It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.
 
3.5.	Living area

The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9).
Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,
 


 

Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.



Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.

3.6.	Outdoor space

The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,
 
such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.

3.7.	Future trends

Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a

Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.

 
prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11).
This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.
 
3.8.	Personalization

The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners.
In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a
 

 

viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.

3.9.	Other considerations

The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire.
These can be divided into three main themes:

A)	Issues related to the content:
-	I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff;
-	In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process;
-	Single room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside;
-	I believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”;
-	A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration;
-	Fundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important
 

to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife;
- I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community;
B)	Issues related to the form and process of the survey:
-	Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions;
-	Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities;
C)	Issues related to staff training and education:
-	All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself );
-	Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces;
-	It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and
 

 

chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.

3.10.	Comparison of the results

The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses.
Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,
 

favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).

4.	Discussion and conclusion

The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with
 




 

Figure 13. The comparison between the results from the Case studies and Questionnaire.
 

 

the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed.
The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.

5.	Research limitations and future developments

The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage
 

and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents.
However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

10.22712/susb.20230019,A Framework for implementing biophilic design in cancer healthcare spaces to enhance patients’ experience,2023,"Recently the demand for new Cancer healthcare Facilities has expanded, requiring a new design approach of spaces that prioritizes patients’ needs and faces their challenges, during treatment, patients lack interaction with nature. This issue is closely related to Biophilic Architecture, which promotes the incorporation of nature into building design for health and psychological benefits. So, this study aims to develop a framework for integrating Nature in cancer treatment buildings to improve patients’ space experience and thus their health outcomes, The study is based on data collected through an efficient literature search on cancer patients’ needs, related to the Biophilic design approaches and patterns in the built environment, site visits, on-site observations, and surveys. 77 attributes were extracted and used as a foundation for the survey conducted in case study areas to identify patients’ preferences. The analytical process of the survey results demonstrates the advantageous outcomes of “Nature in the Space” biophilic design implementations. Statistical analysis revealed the impact of each pattern on patient satisfaction and stress reduction, highlighting the most and least significant patterns. It was found that patients favor direct visual connection with nature aspects in waiting and chemotherapy areas. Finally, this paper recommends for decision-makers a prioritization framework for biophilic design interventions to improve the cancer healthcare space design to better meet patients’ needs and enhance their healthcare space experience. © International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.","With a focus on sustainable development, the goals and desired beneficial outcomes of asset rehabilitation are examined as a challenging process. Instead of building new cities, sustainable development aims to reclaim abandoned land. Buildings and the entire infrastructure are being renovated as a result of his growth, making the area more desirable as a location for investment or habitation [1, 2]. An urban heritage city core can be found at the heart of many cities all over the world. In addition to offering their communities significant social, cultural, and economic benefits, they provide them with an exceptional sense of place and identity. Urban sprawl, population growth, and other issues that could lead to the neglect or even destruction of historic sites and buildings, unfortunately, frequently cause serious issues in these areas. In order to ensure sustainable development for future generations while preserving our common cultural heritage, urban heritage city centre must be revitalized. A thorough strategy that involving numerous stakeholders is necessary to accomplish this. Many cities struggle to
 


 
finance significant projects due to limited resources and finances. Due to competing interests among various stakeholders, such initiatives frequently face a lack of political will or public support. Figure 1 show, that the greatest appreciation of heritage values improves all three dimensions of this interdisciplinary approach, enhancing quality of life in accordance with current requirements (synchronic). The conservation of growth plans for standard of living (syn-diachronic) and the realization of these historical values by future gene- rations (diachronic). In all three directions, this is accurate. Multimodal analysis may have a negative impact on the cultural of protected old urban sections or Heritage sites, leading to an overabundance of tourist attractions, employment losses, and a reduction in picture quality. Less intergenerational responsibility and little community participation will result from this. Unsustainable heritage management has an impact on the historic modal, which will eventually be destroyed in a proactive manner. It will also be negatively im- pacted by the loss of scientific knowledge, the sense of an unfriendly environment, environmental contami- nation, and the ineffective utilization of land and structures. Furthermore, restoring historical structures can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Despite these challenges, revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city cores is critical for achieving sustainable

development in communities. This not only helps to preserve the shared cultural heritage, but it also has economic benefits: by investing in historic building restoration, we create jobs and attract new businesses, which can increase tax revenues for local govern- ments. Additionally, preserving historic sites gives locals special places to explore and enjoy while fostering a sense of community pride. Urban redevelopment is initially defined by Roberts [3] as a complete and integrated vision that solves urban issues and aims to enhance the economic, social, and environmental circumstances of a place that has undergone trans- formation. The components of sustainable development could be classified to environmental, economic, and social; they contend that in reality, each component of sustainability is handled by a number of redevelop- ment objectives [4]. Furthermore, sustainability evaluations should make allowance for interdependencies, economic, environmental, and social challenges, along with the long-term effects of current actions [5]. However, because of a number of issues and the participation of several parties, redevelopment is highly complicated. It is a complex task, thus it is essential that dangers and difficulties are recognized right away. When an old structure reaches the end of its useful life, it needs to be renovated. Over time there is appreciation in land and depreciation in building structure while providing an example of determining the best moment for renovation [6]. Once the value of the land exceeds the worth of the structure, it is much more acceptable to redevelop the building. This view is supported by the fact that the majority of the structures in Hilla’s historic district actually exist. Older buildings in Hilla’s city center have a lifespan of 40 to 150 years (Figure 2), but land value with existing development limitation laws is significantly more than the present worth of those buildings and their use. Numerous buildings in the city’s historic district undergo renovations regardless of their age or longevity. Sustainable urban redeve-
 


 
lopment, which also acts as a policy agenda to improve social, environmental, and economic conditions, reduces the adverse effects of urban expansion [5]. The historic district of Hilla is expanding quickly. By increasing the value of the land, urban redevelopment activities, infrastructural growth, and rising land and construc- tion demand all support the gentrification tendency. Hilla’s heritage city centre is unique due to the fact that it is not very old and experiencing fast transformation. Hilla’s considerable past as well as its quick transition helps to establish its perception as a dynamic, energetic city with deeply embedded heritage values. Rapid progress does, however, entail consequences. One the one hand, Hilla centre is valued for its historical relevance and heritage values by businesspeople, visitors, and urban planners. On the other hand, it is apparent that despite the city’s fast expansion and the requirement for urban renewal, Hilla historical assets and distinguishing traits must be preserved. This paper purposes to demonstrate how, Hilla urban growth and constructed heritage pre- servation may coexist and cooperate to assist one another. Also, it will demonstrate how historical values’ economic potential might aid urban development. Heri- tage values might be fabricated or even built from

scratch in order to promote urban growth. Despite the fact that Iraq possesses several historical cities with worldwide historical significance, the Hilla is in the frontline of conservation. This kind of strategy may promote participation and awareness among stake- holders, communities, and decision-makers. Through sustainable urban redevelopment, which also helps developers and planners solve significant environmen- tal concerns, the idea of sustainability is being spread among architects, planners, and developers [4]. Sustai- nable development has been cited as requiring the preservation of cultural heritage. The utilizing the city’s history necessitates that the entire city and surrounding area be maintained in top condition, and not just each individual structure [7]. In order to achieve a balance between the past and present of significant urban areas, adjustments should be made to a city’s tangible and intangible aspects as part of the larger goal of historical conservation. As a case study, urban and building rehabilitation plans have not yet been significantly influenced by sustainability. Recent research has been done to improve the connection between sustainability and building or urban rehabilitation in worldwide practices. The rationale for conducting this study, As we have seen from the literature review, there is a real need to develop a new methodology. This methodology is essential for the formulation and selection of indicators to assess sustainability, with a composite framework approach [8]. The contribution of the study to the existing literature is the proposed approach offers a considerable advance in how heritage is appraised in connection to the overall objectives of urban sustainability. The finding of common indicators between urban development and heritage conservation may assist in anticipating issues, identifying priorities, and giving baseline knowledge to support more and better sustainable practices in urban redevelopment [9]. The conflict of forces to transform the city centre and its historical assets needs new strategies empha-
 


 
sizing the necessity of sustainable development in the old city centre. In other words, it must evaluate the current city centre, its historical relevance and values, as well as its application for the redevelopment purposes.

Research Question
The research question was developed to explore how to apply the redevelopment model inside urban historic sites as a step toward sustainability. The primary idea is that revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city center is critical for achieving sustainable development. This study aims to shed more light on the importance of preserving urban history and how to remove impediments to the advancement of the sustai- nability paradigm. There is a lack of studies and frameworks that can be successfully used in cities at the local level, prompting the research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating local sustainability indicators and encouraging the recons- truction of heritage urban districts?”


Review of Sustainable Development Models
Sustainable development is an evolving concept, and heritage is now recognized to have great potential in contributing to social, economic and environmental sustainability goals. Heritage conservation has improved quality of life and reduced carbon emissions [11]. The new urban agenda recognizes heritage as an important factor for urban sustainable development, but there is no general consensus on how to best approach and deal with it. Examining the current redevelopment models is one way to identify the key components of a strong model for assessing sustainability and comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of each model. For the strategic and operational evaluation of sustainable urban redevelopment, a number of methods and tools have
 
recently been developed, reporting through indicators [12]. These tools are well-liked because they can evaluate urban management performance and competitiveness in the context of sustainability goals [13]. Sustaina- bility analyses provide metrics for activity outcomes and a way to track them over time [14]. They also serve as investment recommendations. They make it possible to set the objectives and support the decision- making procedures. Since they frequently serve multiple functions, they are crucial in operational calculations for the planners, the administrators, the legislators, and the decision-makers.
A 2016 study found that the most effective method for assessing the objectivity of sustainable project and policy scopes is rating systems. There are few indicators of heritage status and little scholarly literature devoted to heritage [9]. A set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the potential contribution that heritage can make to sustainable development must be developed because of these factors [15]. Indicators of sustai- nability may be evaluated using a variety of techniques for creating sustainable redevelopment models [16]. Due to its inherent complexity and ambiguity, sustai- nable development is challenging to evaluate and quantify. To assist organize such complexity for the sake of information exchange and decision making, it is necessary to have a complete grasp of the linkages between diverse environmental, economic, and social variables [17-21]. The definition of sustainable develo- pment by [22], which strives to provide a systematic framework for developing indicators and information systems, is a key classic text in this area. The primary model types that may be used to create sustainable redevelopment models are combination models [23]. The problem with these approaches is that there is no connection between sustainability goals and sustainability indicators. Three fundamental conceptual frameworks are listed by [24] as being used by indicator initiatives in all throughout the world, which are 1) A framework
 


 
for measuring regional sustainability that centers on a long-term outlook for the area; 2) Short-term goal models that don’t attempt to satisfy the requirement to show relationships between indicator regions; 3) Models that emphasize performance assessment. These models’ flaws include their emphasis on Bottom level (Local community) without top level (Expertise). Model is unique in that it incorporates ideas like domains, system orientators, and capitals [25]. Five categories of models are described by [26]: domain, goal, sectoral, issue, and causal frameworks. These models’ flaw is that there is no link between Top and Bottom. Al-Alwani [8] created a methodology to help with local Middle Eastern municipal assessments of sustainability. The disadvantage in this model is focusing on the Top level more than Bottom level. Each of these models and methodologies in above has weaknesses.

Methodology
In order to investigate a unique and information rich case that was selected for the in-depth study, this work used a mixed qualitative approach.

inability performance will be created. For the investi- gation of a single case study, this model has been chosen. One instance may satisfy every need for eva- luating the theory, whether to confirm, refute, or expand it. The theory proposition can then be evaluated against the single case (Hilla) to see if it is true or whether another possibility is more pertinent. Data from single or numerous studies are often applied to theories rather than to populations, hence they might be used to support theories but not populations [27]. This research is qualitative and quantitative; weighting factors had been used to analyze the data obtained and focuses on the factors that have direct relevance to the approach to urban redevelopment. These significant determinants were developed based on the theoretical background that established the three major factors which are environmental, social and economic factors. Urban redevelopment is an integrated action that is emerging with the purposes to catch long-term answers to the problems of issues such as physical, social, economic and environmental by participation and coo- peration [28]. In this research a model composed of five key stages (Figure 3) was utilized to assess the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of the redevelopment project. One of the main advantages of this method is that it can be used as a tool for ranking indicators to confirm covered and ignored issues [29]. It raises the ability of indicators to be easier to recognize and to help transfer valuable infor- mation to decision makers [30]. However, the disad- vantage is that it is quite modest and does not collect some of the complex interrelationships between a diversity of the dimensions of sustainability [30].

Data Collection
Accurate data collection is essential for maintaining the integrity of research. By selecting the right data collection tools (Figure 4) and outlining how to use
 


 

 
Figure 4. Data collection tools.

them correctly, the likelihood of errors is reduced. A formal process for data collection is necessary to ensure that the data is precise and well-defined. This provides a basis for comparison and offers a suggestion of areas for improvement. In this research five techniques for gathering data were used and highlighted in the following subsections as follow:

Wide ranging review of literature
As a conceptual step, data was gathered from many sources, such as prior studies, official reports, and government papers, followed by a study of urban sus- tainability and a comparison of worldwide evaluation methodologies. This research started with a look at the literature on urban redevelopment as a concept, as well as a sustainability evaluation for urban regeneration initiatives. Various materials, including published gover- nment reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research reports, and items appearing on websites and in the media, were studied as part of the literature study. Furthermore, official and academic documents as well as statistical information regarding the case study regeneration have been analysed. Reviewing the available case study literature makes it clear that there is a lack of an all-encompassing policy of urban development that would direct laws in accordance with the demands of the contemporary socio-economic reality. Additionally, some of these rules and regulations can be at odds with the fresh redevelopment ideas. The literature review findings from the first stage were
 
synthesized to reveal the relevant indicator or criteria. It explains the concepts represented in the analysis and to formulate the requirements for developing the model. These criteria were further refined in the second and third stages conducted with number of experts from various backgrounds of the case study.

Field observation
Following the literature review, to gather infor- mation for the case-study analysis, a field investigation was carried out on-site. It’s crucial together data from various sources when performing a case-study analysis. Field observation is one of the best ways to achieve this. Field observation can offer important insights into how people interact with and experience the subject matter in real life after completing a literature review, which gives an overview of the available research on the subject. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct interviews and to make the surveys. During the site visits, researchers made observations in relation to sustainability. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct the interviews, to make the surveys, and to make their own observations in the area in relation to sustainability. The primary sources of data gathering for the study included interviews, questionnaires, and the researchers’ personal observations. The indicators to assess the case study were carried out using the data and information gathered during the field investigation. Taking pictures of buildings and observing the surroundings of the site, which may have an impact on building condition, are also included in this phase. Understanding the cons- truction of historical structures and the history of urban development is also necessary for the case study process.

Semi-structured interview
Using open-ended questions, a large number of
 


 
interviews were done to look at how locals and stake- holders saw the difficulties associated with urban redevelopment in a case study. In this case study, the local residents and the stakeholders which have know- ledge of urban redevelopment projects in their commu- nity participated in semi-structured interviews. Through these discussions, researchers were able to identify recurring themes regarding the difficulties encoun- tered when implementing such projects, including: a lack of resources; poor communication between the various parties involved; difficulty obtaining necessary permits; and resistance from existing residents due to concern over displacement or lifestyle changes brought on by new development plans. The public’s goals for tackling local urban concerns were elicited through the interview process. One of the most effective methods for acquiring information to comprehend certain app- roaches to urban change has shown to be conducting interviews. As a result, this article is based on a theoretical research, a geographical analysis, and anal- ytical talks with provincial councils, local authorities, architects, planners, decision makers (government officials), religious academics, local inhabitants, and regular visitors to the city. In a case study, twenty interviews were done.

Focus group
Discussions and consultation with a panel of experts resulted in the development of a list of local evaluation components. It takes expert advice to sort the criteria found during the literature review and stakeholder interview so that you can understand their local impor- tance. A panel of experts has been established from significant stakeholder groups, including academia, government, and industry. Together, this group evaluates potential paths for social, environmental, and economic growth while speculating on possible future occurrences and scenarios to depict them throughout the visioning stage. This study aims to offer a number of sustai-
 
nability measures. It was found through this focus group that the development technique was sufficient and the signals were reliable. The focus group method is used in this study in order to focus on problems and wishes connected to local sustainability as well as gathering qualitative information and perspectives from a group of people [31].

Questionnaire survey
On the basis of iterative questionnaire consultation with expert panels, Delphi is utilized to develop the proper weightings indicators. Panelists were (six experts from the city of Hilla four experts with academic qualifications and two with relevant experience) selected based on their record of publications in the fields of sustainability, urban regeneration, planning, and deve- lopment, as well as their standing in research and reputation on both the national and international levels. Those in the public sector such as planners, economic development and urban regeneration consultants as well as policymakers legislators, real estate developers, regeneration consultants, and others are all represented. After a sufficient level of consensus was attained by using a Delphi technique, the expert responses were gathered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from unimportant to highly important. Experts were given a thorough list of the indicators of redevelopment along with a questionnaire that ranked each indicator’s relative value on an important scale.

Case study
The researchers conducted case studies with the aim of completing a thorough investigation of the area to find and describe the phenomena and the essential elements [32]. Additionally, a thorough examination of a case study’s duration frequently forms part of the research design or, at the very least, requires the use of data. Additionally, by reproducing the correlated patterns, the consideration of multiple case studies contributes
 


 
to a more reliable result, enhancing the validity and robustness of the theory. Additionally, a three stage procedure is included. The new model was evaluated in a case study to guarantee its dependability. Vali- dating and testing the models before implementing them is a crucial step in ensuring the success of urban redevelopment initiatives. Teams can be sure that their models will function as expected once deployed in cities all over the world by utilizing these techniques during the development phase, such as running simula- tions based on real-world scenarios. Now that it is aware of this, it is able to anticipate even greater advancements made possible by novel solutions, like those offered by our recently tested framework. Veri- fication and testing are necessary for any urban redeve- lopment project to be successful. Teams can make sure that their plans will work in practical situations and produce the best results for citizens by taking the time to evaluate frameworks prior to implementation. The

Context
This study concentrated on Hilla, the provincial capital of Iraq’s Babel province, has a rich history and culture. Hilla, located on the banks of the Euphrates River, has long been an important trading and com- mercial center. Because of its archaeological sites and monuments, it has grown in popularity as a tourist destination in recent years. It is situated at 32.46 latitude and 44.42 longitude (Figure 5). The city of Hilla extends along the eastern and western banks of the Euphrates River. The city has an area of about (5243) hectares and a total population density of (63.71 people/ha). The part that is to be redeveloped in this paper consists of 2 residential neighborhoods. This city was chosen because it possesses traits common to many other Middle Eastern nations and contains a significant number of distinctive cultural heritages that have not yet been certified as cultural heritage struc- tures (Figure 6). Due to its close vicinity to the ancient city of Babylon, which has given the city a great relevance in terms of development potential, Hilla has a unique chance. Additionally, it is one of the major Iraqi cities, and its central business district is home to a large number of viable old buildings. The city has made a concerted effort to appreciate the value of and renovate this old building stock. The case study was also, chosen because it was thought that it may serve as a suitable illustration for the examination of local urban redevelopment strategies and serve as an example of the lessons that can be gained from local redeve- lopment initiatives.

Case Study application
The research started with literature reviews on urban
 


 
redevelopment concept and sustainability assessment for urban redevelopment projects. Numerous materials, including officially released reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research papers, articles from websites and media, have been examined. To gather data and information for the case study analysis, a field study had been carried out locally after the literature review. During the field research, several interviews were made with many stakeholders and local people living in the city.
The interviews and survey are consisted of ques- tions such as: What are problems and challenges in

your city? What are your wishes for redevelopment your city? How can your city be improved in your view? The focus group had been conducted and consists of expertise to build -up a list of indicators and the final form of the assessment model was achieved through Questionnaire survey (Delphi technique).

Problems Identification
This research study is focused on building a model for redevelopment assessment of old building with emphasis on sustainable redevelopment in old part in Hilla. The primary sources of data for the study were surveys, interviews, fieldwork, and the researchers’ personal observations in addition to analysis of the literature to determine the key difficulties or concerns of local sustainability in the city of Hilla, Iraq, as the chosen case study. The indicator-based evaluation of the case study was conducted using the data and information (Table 1) gathered during the field inves- tigation.

Build-up sustainable redevelopment Indicators
For efficient group discussions, it is advised that the size be between six and twelve [34]. Ten people were in the focus group for this case study. Each indication had been constructed using a logic process that was devised in cooperation with the experts from various

disciplines present at this focus group, and all concerns expressed were organized into their associated dimen- sions as shown in Figure 7.

Delphi technique
The Delphi approach was used to generate group agreement based on expert opinions when the intended redevelopment indicators were met [35]. Experts with comprehensive knowledge of linked topics and skilled specialists participated. The use of the multi-stage
 
tionnaire with an itemized rating system was used to rank indications on a priority basis, with forty experts participating in practice. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insig- nificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model

and provide more insight and information as needed after taking into account the previous experts’ replies at the focus group [36]. Two crucial rounds of the Delphi approach were used in this study: idea generation to help restrict the field or insight. Delphi searches for as much more information as it can simultaneously in order to educate and foster consensus by fusing a wide variety of expert viewpoints [37].

their understanding of various environmental factors, social and economic challenges, urban planning and design, and political concerns pertaining to urban regions. Following the first round of Delphi questionnaires, expert opinion showed that there was no extension of the original list of indicators and no modifications in the indicators found in the previous phase (focus group). They were then moved into the quantitative stage to determine their relative relevance. A ques-

Discussion of Results
The research establishes to address the main research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating sustainability indicators and encouraging the reconstruction of historic urban districts? In order to address this main research question, the research in this paper built a new methodology to develop suitable local sustainability indicators to facilitate assessment of local sustainability and verified the new methodology for its applicability in heritage part for city of Hilla as a case study. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insignificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model urban redeve- lopment indicators, which is shown in Figure 7
 
includes three main dimensions and 25 urban indi- cators that are prioritized. The indicator with the greatest priority is “Improved Infrastructure networks,” which is followed by “Reduce unemployment” indicator, “Encourage Employability” indicator, “Energy Distri- bution Network” indicator, “Energy efficiency” indicator, and “Modern Sanitation Facilities and Water Networks” indicator. The respondents ranked the conservation of water bodies as being more essential than reducing noise pollution, which had the lowest mean score and greatest sustainability. These results demonstrate that the model is founded on an awareness of the main problems and obstacles associated with local urban regeneration. According to Figure 7, these results may appear unexpected at first sight, but they are really common and expected, particularly in a nation like Iraq where several conflicts have contributed to poverty and instability. Participants also gave priority to these issues since Hilla struggles much in them and because they speak to the needs of the neighborhood. Analysis reveals that participation in heritage is the key element that has the greatest potential to lead to long-term sustainable development. Neighborhood residents were unable to take part in the consultation process due to the lack of formal structures, and many were unclear about the heritage policy. To effectively communicate protection, there needs to be a point of contact between the general public and the local government. By comparing the results obtained in the fieldwork with the theory in literature review, we can confirm that. The new methodology in this paper successfully collected related social, economic, environmental and institutional problems in the heritage part of the city of Hilla over the use of source document analysis, inter- views and focus groups

Design/methodology/approach: This study was performed using a mixed method. Data collection was carried out through observational research and descriptive analysis in six primary health care facilities in Salvador and Lauro de Freitas, Brazil. Findings: Based on this study’s results, facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility have been considered the facilities’ main problems in the investigated context. The impact of the users’ perspective on healthcare facilities was assessed for each of these three criteria to verify the results obtained. Furthermore, most of the parameters were not satisfied, as the buildings analyzed had defects in their physical environment. Therefore, it is necessary to review and pay more attention to the architecture of these cities’ primary health care units. Originality/value: The present study addresses the architectural environment design in Brazil’s healthcare facilities, which still have gaps. Improving the physical space of a health center ensures that the approach used in this research also applies to other health centers in similar contexts. The awareness that space’s activities and configurations will change according to each territory examined will open up so many investigation worlds. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","The development of unsuitable health buildings results from an inappropriate briefing
between architects and builders, and even where the facilities are constructed correctly, they
are not properly used (Silva Santos, 2006). Furthermore, new health centers are often achieved
by adapting existing buildings that do not reflect the regulations. Consequently, the primary
health care facility’s physical space is inadequate to carry out the required healthcare
activity.
Improving the physical environment in health facilities is now considered a necessity. A
consolidated and generalized procedure is needed to ensure proper planning to help designers
to build appropriate and integrated facilities in various developing contexts, especially in
remote areas where healthcare problems are increasing due to the lack of medical assistance,
water, transport and electricity, to identify the possibilities in the area and above all the
problems to solve them rationally.
Planning a social health center requires a multidisciplinary approach to organize the
building over time effectively. The health facility should respond to the rapid changes and the

needs of both the medical staff and the population. Thus, the requirements of flexibility,
modularity, aggregation and reversibility become a key component to respond to the health
structure’s subsequent transformations. This paper on primary care centers addresses a gap
in the healthcare field by exploring the physical features of health units associated with
favorable user outcomes (Gulwadi et al., 2009).
A study was carried out on the architectural configuration of some health centers in the
Metropolitan Area of Salvador (RMS), Bahia state in Brazil, according to a mixed method to
improve basic health facilities’ physical environment. The research aims to verify the state
and the work carried out now on health centers and define design strategies to improve the
architectural space.
2. Theoretical framework
Previously, several studies have been done to investigate the current state of quality in
healthcare architecture. For example, usability is one of the evaluations that assess quality-inuse. It is measured by three parameters: the effectiveness and efficiency of the design or
facilities offered and the user’s satisfaction (Harun et al., 2011). Ariadne Labs has created
guidelines for designers and facilities under construction to design in the healthcare sector
focused on childbirth, explaining, for example, how the quality of the environment and
especially three factors such as capacity, workload and motivation affect the decision to
perform a cesarean delivery (Ariadne Labs, 2017). Another study shows factors influencing
spatial layouts in healthcare buildings, such as safety and well-being, user satisfaction,
organizational and technological adaptability to future changes, spatial configuration,
energy, and environment (Zhao et al., 2009). The same authors Zhao and Mourshed explored
in a newer article the patients’ perspectives on the design of hospital outpatient areas. Their
research evaluated outpatients’ perspectives of the space of the waiting area by investigating
their opinion on a range of hospital design indicators and reflecting on the building design
process (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Additionally, the results of another study, functional
efficiency, user satisfaction, environmental issues, patient safety and flexibility were
considered the main problems in the physical environment of healthcare facilities. Issues such
as user satisfaction, patient safety and accountability in incidents have often been
investigated in terms of management strategies, quality of medical and nursing services, and
medical equipment facilities; instead, the role of architecture in improving the mentioned
factors has gone unnoticed (Ebrahimi et al., 2013).
For this reason, starting from the literature review, the design elements that influence the
quality-in-use of the architectural space have been analyzed under three main aspects:
(1) Capacity of the structure and adaptability to changes;
(2) Functional efficiency and
(3) Accessibility and circulation of external and internal spaces.
These three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate testable
hypotheses verified by users’ perspectives based on an extensive review of the literature and
through direct observation on-site visits.
3. Background
The Alma-Ata Declaration (1978) remains a pivotal document in global health history, setting
a standard of public commitment to make community-led quality healthcare accessible to all,
physically and financially. This was the forerunner of the Global Strategy for Health for All
by the Year 2000, pursued by WHO and its partners for the rest of the twentieth century, and
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: “Ensuring lives healthy and promote well-being for
all at all ages” by 2030.

Health-related SDGs can only be achieved sustainably with a greater emphasis on
primary health care. Therefore, renewing primary health care and placing it at the center of
efforts to improve health and well-being is essential to respond to a complex and rapidly
changing world (World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), 2018). Consequently, it is necessary to rethink the design and construction of new
primary health care facilities and the adaptation of existing ones, particularly the decisionmaking process during the initial stages. Decisions regarding physical characteristics such as
layout design and shape are made early and are difficult to change or reverse later without
significant financial commitments (Zhao et al., 2009).
Because walls are expensive to erect, floor plans of healthcare facilities do not usually
change much in the short term. However, as healthcare systems evolve, clinical environments
have changing needs, and spaces within the building can frequently change every two to
three years. Nevertheless, even when changes are expected, contingency planning and health
projects are rarely informed by empirical evidence of what works and what does not.
Consequences of limited testing include the propagation of low architectural value projects,
costly and potentially harmful to patients (Ariadne Labs, 2017).
Few researchers found that the project draws on previously acquired knowledge, insights
and beliefs derived from decision-making experience. Most of the design related to healthcare
environments is adopted and adapted without knowing if users are satisfied. Despite this lack
of knowledge, a healthcare center should meet people’s needs and achieve balance in the
outcome. Therefore, there is a relationship between the satisfaction of a facility by the user
and a coherent design of the architectural space that brings patients a positive experience and
greater liveability of the healthcare facility (Asfour, 2020). Spatial boundaries also influence
the user’s use of space by the physical and attractive environment (Harun et al., 2011).
In the existing literature relating to the user experience with the healthcare environment,
only a small number of participatory studies focus on spatial design aspects. Most of the
studies concern the quality of service and user satisfaction of the physical environment and
systems, rather than focusing on the user perspectives associated with the design factors of
the built environment in healthcare. However, the perceptions and expectations of patients
and clients are strongly linked to the use of space in the design of healthcare buildings.
Nevertheless, the design factors of healthcare facilities should be better integrated into the
design phase, which has remained largely neglected (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Therefore, it
is also necessary to consider the architectural environment and focus the attention on spatial
design to relate users with space.
Previous studies have shown that good space design reflects health, emotion, reduction of
stress and frustration for the visitor, functional efficiency, visitor accessibility, safety, patient
empowerment and cognitive abilities in spatial understanding (Harun et al., 2011). One of the
factors that influence the end users is designing the space’s layout, which is considered as one of
the main activities in the architectural project, both in new construction and building
adaptation. The layout design involves locating activity spaces or objects in a container space
to maximize or minimize design goals while meeting the required spatial relationships between
component spaces or objects (Ezzeldin et al., 2021). Designing primary health care buildings’
spaces requires special attention due to the close and complicated relationships between space
and function (Zhao et al., 2009). However, little research has been done on the space layout of
primary health buildings. The research reported here investigates the factors that influence the
design of space layouts in healthcare buildings taking into account the perspective of users.
3.1 Primary health care system in Brazil
Since the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, whose purpose was to achieve “Health for All,” Brazil
has implemented the Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Sa  ude [SUS]) and organized 
Improving

facilities

health services. It also defined primary health care as a gateway and the main strategy to
accomplish the goal and promote health, prevention through universality, integrity and
equity. However, primary health care in Brazil is characterized by problems of the facilities’
physical environment (Facchini et al., 2006).
The Ministry of Health in 1994 implements primary health care with the Family Health
Strategy to reorganize basic care in the SUS. The Family Health Team implements this
strategy, a multi-professional team that assists the families within the Basic Health Unit,
responsible for a specific number of families in a defined geographical area (Marqui et al.,
2010). There can be a maximum of five Family Health Teams in each health center to have
greater population coverage. It is recommended that each team be responsible for between
600 and 1,000 families (2,400 to 4,500 inhabitants), with an average of 3,000 people (Escorel
et al., 2007).
The Ministerial Decree No. 2,226/2009 establishes the National Plan for the
Implementation of Basic Health Units for Family Health Teams to guide professionals and
municipal health managers in designing, planning projects for the construction and extension
of primary health units. The tool has 15 activities (Figure 1): reception, waiting area, medical
record room, meeting room, health agent room, medical office, procedure room, vaccination
room, collection room, nebulization room, curative room, dental office, brushing room,
compressor and pump area and sterilization room. The area of these spaces and the activities
can also be extended according to the local needs and the activities planned, such as
administration or management room, warehouse and pharmacy (Ministerio da Saude, 2009  ).
Although Brazil has not achieved the “Health for All by the Year 2000” target, it has made
significant progress, even though the Brazilian National Health System does not work at full
capacity.
Previous studies conducted in some Bahia municipalities, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato
Grosso have shown deficiencies in the physical structure. “Multicenter survey conducted in
seven Brazilian states showed the architectural deficits of these health units, for 59.8% of the
units were classified as inadequate, as for their infrastructure” (Gomes et al., 2015).

Given the Family Health Team’s interdisciplinary nature, the use of physical spaces must
be thought of in a new way, allowing their use in a shared way between different
professionals and activities at different times. Functional requirements change. The change
can take place in different time cycles (short, medium and long term) and at various levels:
from the replacement of the equipment to the renewal and expansion of the medical offices, to
the complete change in the use of the spaces, to the expansion of the structure. The change can
occur either because some parts become obsolete or because of a change in medical practices
or the organizational patterns of activities. The key to a health center being able to manage
change is to use flexible buildings effectively (Kendall, 2012). “The next generation of health
care buildings for the primary sector will be flexible long-life buildings, based on a
comprehensive briefing document where design quality plays a major part in establishing the
design philosophy” (Purves, 2002, p. 23).
4. Methodology
This study applies a mixed-method approach that combines and integrates observational
research and the descriptive analysis of six different primary health care facilities (USFs)
design. The research was conducted on-site between May and October 2016 in the north-east
of Brazil, in the state of Bahia, and precisely in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador
characterized by a high index of urbanization and population density compared to the rest of
the state and brings together large urban centers with diversified and specialized functions. It
includes 13 municipalities, such as Salvador and the neighboring Lauro de Freitas, which are
the subjects of this research.
According to a territorial analysis (detailed in the following paragraph), the researcher
selected several primary health units to maximize the diversity of facilities. The design
elements measured in this study have been identified based on the literature review carried
out so far. These elements have been further refined and adapted to the reference context.
Therefore, from the literature review focusing on the impact of design on healthcare
environments, the design elements that could affect the architectural space were analyzed
under three aspects: facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility (Table 1).
The three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate verifiable
hypotheses. The health outcomes of each of these three criteria were analyzed through a
Table 1.

cross-sectional analysis through the experience and perception of users derived from the
existing literature review and the direct observation during site visits. This allowed to
strengthen the subjective experience of the user and not to focus the results obtained on the
functionality of the building in terms of administration and healthcare delivery as a service.
User satisfaction connects the perception and experience of spaces with the architectural
design of the health facilities. The purpose and the use of the spaces were confirmed by on-site
visits with sketches and photographs, users’ observations and facility managers’ interviews.
The researcher requested the floor plans for the selected facilities. Floor plans were
redesigned as needed using design software to identify and count rooms by type and measure
key distances and spaces. Further reasoning was made to interpret these results to generate
specific hypotheses on how the design can influence physical space design through the user’s
experience. The project posed no risk to users, and site visits were authorized by the clinical
director of each facility visited.
4.1 Facility selection
The selection of six primary health units has enabled the acquisition of a wide range of
facilities in different districts. To identify candidate facilities, a study of Salvador and Lauro
de Freitas’s territory was carried out considering their division into health districts rather
than administrative ones. Of all the RMS cities, Salvador is the most important, as it is the
capital of the State of Bahia, with about 2,886,698 inhabitants (IBGE, 2020) and occupies a
territorial extension of 693,453 km2 (2019). Its political and administrative organization
includes 18 administrative regions and 12 health districts. Instead, Lauro de Freitas has an
estimated population of 201,635 (IBGE, 2020) with a land area of 58,143 km2 (2019) and is
divided into 19 administrative districts and 7 health districts.
The six units’ selection criteria were based on a territorial study based on the distribution
of five types of development in the analyzed territory: low, medium-low, medium, mediumhigh and high (Figure 2). The health centers (USF) were then superimposed on the
development zones map (Carvalho and Silva, 2009).
Figure 2.

The analysis shows that the primary health care facilities partially uncover part of the
eastern coast along the Atlantic Ocean. This area is mainly composed of high-income
populations that mainly benefit from private services, without recourse to the aid with low
efficiency characterized by long waiting time. On the other hand, the disadvantaged areas are
found in the central area and on the internal coast of Bay of All Saints (Baıa de Todos os Santos),
where a greater concentration of primary health care units emerges to help deprived people.
To have a different range of health facilities, three units in the less developed health
district (Suburbio Ferrovi  ario) and a health unit in a developed area (Itapu~a) located along the
coast of the Atlantic Ocean were selected for the municipality of Salvador.
While in Lauro de Freitas, two health units have been selected, one in the northern
marginal district (Areia Branca) and the other in a developed area along the coast (Ipitanga).
In the peripheral area of the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador, the health facilities of Unidade
de Saude da Fam  ılia (USF) Alto de Coutos, USF Alto de Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha
were analyzed, instead in the high development area of the Itapu~a, the USF Mussurunga was
selected. In Lauro de Freitas, the USF Parque S~ao Paulo in the marginal district of Areia
Branca and the USF Vila Praiana in the developed area of Ipitanga were considered for
the study.
5. Design data collection
The data collection was structured in three parts: site visits, interviews and facility profile.
5.1 Site visits
The researcher conducted site visits at the six selected units (Figure 3) to capture a wide range
of facility types in the different development zones. During each visit, the researcher met with
Figure 3.

the facility’s representatives, including clinical directors, nursing managers and operations
managers. The researcher organized a structured site visit guide to provide a standardized
organization at each visit and ensure that all research questions were discussed with each
facility team. Each site visit lasted approximately three hours, including an introductory
conversation to understand the building and facility’s history, a facility tour following the
patient’s pathway through the center.
5.2 Interviews
The most important findings identified during the site visits and which had not been
captured through floor plans were identified, including descriptive details on how specific
design elements influenced care. Based on these results, on-site interviews were carried out,
trying to cover as much information as possible in a period of about half an hour. The
interviews were conducted with the team present in the building during the visit, involving
the facility’s representatives (clinical directors, nursing managers and operations managers).
Facility managers were interviewed as they are aware of user feedback and experiences. The
facility manager’s task is to improve the environment, people, spatial relationships,
functional, environmental and economic aspects (Harun et al., 2011). The interviewer took
notes to use in the data analysis. Like site visits, information from interviews increased the
data accessed from floor plan analysis and improved understanding of relevant issues and
assumptions about how design affects care. Furthermore, during the on-site visits, walking
through accessible public spaces, waiting rooms and waiting corridors, it was observed how
users use and perceive the health center’s space and activities. This method is used to learn
about the intended uses, new uses and misuses of design.
5.3 Facility profiles
To collect the data, each health unit was personally visited by the researcher and evaluated
through direct observation and the application of structured tables divided into the three
criteria mentioned above useful for the analysis. To complete the table about the health
center’s general data, especially the year of construction, the number of employees, the
Family Health Team, and the patients per day, it was necessary to consult the facility
manager. During the tour, the researcher sketched the relevant aspects of the health center for
later analysis, such as representing the accessibility of the structure of USF Alto de Coutos II
or the waiting area of USF Parque S~ao Paulo (Figure 4). Sketches of the floor plans (Figure 5)
define the spaces’ dimensions and the activities’ subdivision, useful for filling the table’s
functional efficiency. The researcher photographed key areas (Plate 1) to verify the physical
Figure 4.

aspects and the quality of the spaces surveyed to compare them with the acquired plans.
Subsequently, the researcher was authorized to collect the selected health centers’ digital
plans in the prefecture. The acquired plans were updated and implemented following the
changes in the activities identified by the researcher during the inspection. The floor plans
were traced using an architectural drawing software (Figure 6) to equalize measures for
comparison across facilities’ measured areas (square meters), distances (meters) and units
(number) using built-in computer-aided design software tools.
6. Results
The comparative analysis between the case studies is summarized in the tables
corresponding to the three criteria identified. Facility capacity, functional efficiency and
space accessibility have been considered the facilities’ main problems in the investigated
context. To verify the results obtained by the three criteria, the patients’ perspective was
considered to assess their satisfaction in relation to the architecture design.

6.1 Facility capacity
The first criterion focuses on the healthcare facility’s capacity, as the size of the spaces and
their adequacy, the flexibility of the facility to possible future changes. The collected data
were compared in Table 2 and analyzed according to the three aspects: flexibility in design,

multifunction activities in an area and expandability of spaces in addition to general data
such as the year of construction, days and hours of the opening, which only serve to give a
general picture of the facilities.
(1) Adaptability in design. From the site visit and the data compared in the table, it can be
seen how three of the six structures analyzed are not built to be primary health units;
USF Vila Praiana and USF Parque S~ao Paulo are examples. Both are residential villas
that were later adapted to the health function. It was found that most of the primary
health care centers of Salvador and Lauro de Freitas are existing structures born as
living spaces unsuitable for the health facility. As a private space, the house is
unsuitable to the health function because often the residential spaces do not respect
the minimum size provided by the Ministerial Decree. An example is the USF Vila
Praiana, with limited waiting spaces and small corridors that do not adequately allow
users to circulate. Converting residential spaces with healthcare functions involves an
inadequate distribution of activities and a difficult distribution of flows between
doctors and patients.
In addition to these USFs derived from existing buildings, there are also primary
health care units considered as “model” health facilities, such as USF Alto de Coutos II
in Salvador. Visiting this health center, it was possible to perceive that this building
was built to be a health center respecting a clear functional organization of spaces
following regulations and legislation.
(2) Expandability of spaces. The buildings, even those built to be health centers, were not
planned to be enlarged in the future. However, the on-site surveys noted the possibility
of some buildings being expanded by occupying the nearby parking lot or garden.
However, this would entail high costs as the structure was not designed in a modular
way or was not designed to expand in the future. For example, in the USF Alto da
Terezinha, it is evident that inner space is reduced, and the structure needs to be
enlarged to accommodate new medical offices. Therefore, it is clear how the structure,
despite being newly built, is not very flexible.
(3) Facility size. From the observational research on-site and the analysis carried out,
activities that do not comply with the minimum dimensions provided for by the
Ministerial Decree 2.226/09 are noted. The houses adapted to health centers have
dimensions that are not quite adequate to perform the health function. The overall
area of a building can be considered an upstream measure that affects many other
functional areas, the quality of circulation and staff support spaces’ capacity. The
positive thing is that this has allowed us to begin to have internal flexibility of the
spaces, such as the meeting room that has both an educational and refreshment
function in the USF Alto da Terezinha, or some clinics are shared by different doctors
on rotation to carry out the various activities. However, the small size of some rooms
also limits their potential usability and space flexibility.
To verify the results obtained on the capacity of the building, the perception of users was
considered through some main factors listed in Table 3, as there is a strong interest in the
patient-centered design of healthcare facilities by integrating the perception of users with the
physical environment.
Evidence from the literature review indicate that users expect more from the healthcare
environment in addition to a high-quality health service, such as appropriate and defined waiting
area, suitable space for families to wait, adequate number of seats, seating comfort, entertainment
facilities, appropriate and proportionate spaces to be used by staff and users, spaciousness

and respect for user privacy (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Reiling et al., 2008; Fausto et al., 2017;
Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). The direct observation of users during on-site visits, such as their
experience of inaccessibility of the spaces with reduced dimensions of the healthcare facility
environments, confirmed how these factors affect the outcome of the facility’s capacity.
Furthermore, the existing literature suggests that the number of visits of the users to the health
facility has influenced their perspectives on spatial and seating aspects (Zhao and Mourshed,
2017). The crowded waiting room and corridors make users uncomfortable with the surrounding
environment; this factor is one of the most important in the patient’s perspectives, and deserves
more attention in the design process. Therefore, the facility design can have a direct impact on
users’ satisfaction, a patient’s stress experience and organizational performance metrics (Reiling
et al., 2008).
6.2 Functional efficiency
According to the on-site analysis and comparing the six healthcare facilities, a key issue of the
physical environment considered in the research was the functional efficiency, including
nonfunctioning supplies and the distribution of functions present in health facilities (Table 4).
(1) Broken furniture. From the comparative analysis described in Table 4, it is observed
that some spaces are closed to the public due to faulty or malfunctioning equipment.
For example, the main problems related to the closure of some doctors’ offices are
listed below.
 USF Alto de Coutos II, the curative room’s air conditioning is malfunctioning, so
the room has been closed. The door and the window of the sterilization room do not
follow the regulations.
 USF Alto de Coutos, one of the dental offices, is closed due to a medical
equipment’s malfunction.
 USF Alto da Terezinha has several problems, including one of the rooms dedicated
to dentists is closed due to the medical equipment’s malfunction. The curative
room is closed due to the air conditioning’s malfunction, and the sterilization room
has broken equipment (autoclave). Therefore, there is a lack of maintenance in
various structures to have an efficient functionality of the spaces.
(2) Recognizable functional units. The medical offices do not have a specific name from
the information collected, but they are also subdivided into nursing and doctor office.
Functional units are not always recognizable. Signs indicate that various rooms in the
structures are designed to be health facilities but without specifying the exact activity.
Also, outside the doors of each clinic room, there is a sign with the words Clinic 01,
Clinic 02, Clinic 03, etc. but the internal function is not clear. This does not facilitate the
user in identifying spaces within the structure.

capacity criteria

(3) Zoning of health facilities space. From the analysis of the researcher’s drawings, such
as the diagrams shown below, we can see the different distribution of the plans and
activities between USF Alto De Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha (Figure 7).
The USF Alto De Coutos II is represented in the first exploded view diagram on the left of
Figure 7. It is considered a model health center. The health function activities are distributed
on a single floor, on the ground level. Additional space in the basement with the auditorium
function is intended for the staff of the health facility. Therefore, the specific activities are
distributed along the corridor’s sides, divided according to the four general activities
mentioned above (administrative area, clinical area, dental care and logistic support).
The second diagram instead highlights the USF Alto da Terezinha consisting of two
floors. Healthcare activities are distributed on both floors but present problems in terms of
accessibility and usability of the paths due to the lack of an elevator that would facilitate
access for disabled people or patients in difficulty reaching the second floor where the
activities are distributed for clinical care. The difficulty of using the space is also noted in the
USF Mussurunga and the USF Vila Praiana.

According to the users’ perspective in the literature review, some basic problems of the
physical environment were considered from the point of view of functional efficiency
(Table 5), including the use of space and the building, a thermally comfortable environment,
the wide gap between spaces with functional capacity and the scarce use of information
technology as a communication tool. The problem of distance, orientation and dislocation of
services on several levels will cause the patient tired, especially for the disabled and the
elderly. Furthermore, users consider cleanliness, air freshness, noise and thermal comfort as
important to their experience in healthcare facilities. Efficiency does not take too long to fix,
as it is easily accessible (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017).
6.3 Space accessibility
The third criterion, space accessibility, has been analyzed in Table 6 under the aspect of
urban accessibility, the presence of parking lots, the analysis of the external spaces and
internal evaluations of the structure.

(1) Urban accessibility. One of the problems identified during the site visits, especially in
the marginal districts, concerns the accessibility of the facilities. Roads in
underdeveloped districts, such as the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador and the
Areia Branca in Lauro de Freitas, have roads that are not very accessible, such as the
USF Parque S~ao Paulo, which has no paved roads. Furthermore, it is not simple to
find the health center’s location because it is not indicated precisely on the map. Or the
USF Alto de Coutos is difficult to access in case of rain, becoming a torrential road.
The two structures located in the districts along the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore in
the developed area, have good accessibility.
(2) Parking area. Among the public spaces, the parking is undesirable, lacking enough
parking lots in the disadvantaged health districts. Therefore, besides being not very
accessible, these structures are difficult to access due to the lack of parking spaces or
parking lots closed or open only to healthcare staff.
(3) Landscaping area and external spaces. The external areas are not present in the
analyzed structures, and where present, they are poorly maintained. An example is
the USF Parque S~ao Paulo, where the garden is used as a parking lot rather than a
social space for users. Or the garden of the USF Vila Praiana, which is dangerous, as
being a residential villa adapted to the health function, has an abandoned swimming
pool without protection and the risk of falling. A focus on outdoor public spaces
should, therefore, be considered.
(4) Path circulation and waiting areas in inner spaces. The waiting areas are not always
of adequate size for the facility’s capacity, as in the USF Alto de Coutos, where the
waiting area is disproportionate to the number of activities. Furthermore, the waiting
areas are not always located inside the structure but they are located outside (USF
Parque S~ao Paulo and USF Vila Praiana) due to lack of space. There are no waiting

areas near the medical offices and rooms. However, corridors are still used, which
sometimes not having adequate dimensions have limited spaces to perform the
distribution function, as in existing structures (USF Alto de Coutos, USF Parque S~ao
Paulo and USF Praiana) where the corridors have insufficient space to be walked
especially by a patient who walks with difficulty.
USF Alto da Terezinha was an example to analyze the path circulation within the facility
(Figure 8). The plan was redesigned, and the activities were distributed based on the
information gathered during the inspection. In the service spaces (corridors), the main paths
have been drawn divided between patients/visitors and medical staff (doctors, nurses and
public employees). However, what emerges from the analysis is a mixed path of users without
differentiation between the two categories. A first suggestion would be to dedicate the entire
upper floor to logistic and administrative activities that are restricted access areas and used
by doctors, nurses and officials to bring the care activities only to the lower floor to ensure
greater accessibility to the patients.
Space accessibility means how it is easy for users to reach the health facility or the interior
space to get the services they need. Accessing or having a view of the internal and external
landscape is one of the key factors of the users’ perception. Another important factor related
to the user’s emotional comfort is the absence of openings capable of viewing the outside of
the building and the surrounding landscape, especially in the waiting areas where the patient
spends time before being allowed to access the medical offices (Table 7).

The windows in the waiting room would increase the user’s social comfort by integrating
the environment with natural light. Furthermore, data from the literature review indicates
that exposure to light is a key factor to the health and well-being of users in healthcare
environments. However, considering the excessive daylight in the Brazilian context, it can
also cause visual discomfort. A large window could let in more daylight while consuming
more energy for heating or cooling at the same time. Therefore, artificial light should be
adequately balanced with natural light to achieve good thermal and social comfort (Ebrahimi
et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017).
7. Conclusion and implications of the study
The awareness that primary health care is gaining importance is increasing in different parts
of the world, including in Brazil, whose situation is reinforced by numerous studies that
address accessibility to primary health care, or strategic plans to improve the Family Health
Team, or studies on the accessibility of structures and so on. The search for guidelines
oriented toward primary health care architecture, in line with SUS’s principles, is one of the
great challenges that the Brazilian healthcare system still faces. The primary health units
must satisfy the users and respect the Ministry of Health’s physical and human structure
standards. However, in this study, albeit limited to a specific area, the data show that
Salvador and Lauro de Freitas’s cities do not offer users a service that reaches the ideal
standards in its facility, in most health units inspected.
There is a need for better control of the health sector, as the inadequacy of a primary health
care unit’s physical structure directly affects the quality of the community’s service.
The topic investigated is important for medical and nursing staff since professionals who
have greater contact with the population and their actions depend directly on the unit’s
infrastructure to improve healthcare and, consequently, obtain better health results.
The results of the work are part of the tools to support the concept of primary health care
centers; the research outlined in this paper has highlighted the importance of some aspects of
designing healthcare facilities, such as the capacity, the functional efficiency and the spatial
accessibility of the primary health care facilities. Integrating the results of these three criteria
with users’ perspectives to the architectural project was crucial. The research considered the
users’ perspective based on data from the literature review and on-site visits to healthcare
facilities. The perspectives of the users confirm the expected results of the three criteria
analyzed, influencing the health outcomes. A consistent result of this analysis is users’
preference for an environment that offered quality and comfortable space, rather than a place
that only addresses the functionality of the building. This result confirms the inadequacy of
converting residential buildings to healthcare facilities as they require a space of appropriate
size. Furthermore, users have shown interest in a comfortable healthcare environment with
good signage and technological information tools and better zoning of the space with adequate
distribution of medical offices and greater accessibility and usability of the facility. Another
aspect considered fundamental by users is their emotional comfort through openings in the
waiting room that allow the relationship between the internal and external landscape, and this
is a fundamental aspect that should be integrated into the six health centers analyzed and
extended to the other health facilities. The main factors expected by users confirmed the data of
the three criteria used to interpret the results and verify hypotheses. Therefore, user satisfaction
has a strong impact on the design process of health centers. Particular attention was paid to the
spaces created in the healthcare sector, favoring an improvement in the physical space
configurations, which must be considered a space of comfort and well-being, sensitive to social
needs and ensuring the spaces’ flexibility. Therefore, it is not enough to have sufficient
resources to build health facilities if one does not care to guarantee the correct configuration of
spaces and maintenance of these physical spaces.

The present study aims to guide municipal health professionals and managers in the
planning, programming and building of basic health units taking into consideration the users’
perspective. The planning strategies, born from theoretical studies and the analysis and
evaluations of case studies located in Brazil, are applicable for designing new primary health
care centers in similar areas. The suggested spaces should adapt to the local reality that activities
will change according to each territory examined and open up so many investigation worlds.
Defining the primary health care facilities’ characteristics is not easy due to the higher
incidence of prevention and the consequent increase in outpatient areas. Despite the
standardization of the design choices and functional grouping, the overall composition of
future structures’ design will meet the flexibility requirements both in the design and
operational phases. Therefore, it is even more important that healthcare facilities built in the
future are designed to flexibly meet changing needs, including those that can be anticipated
and those that cannot even be imagined.
It is worth recalling that the analysis made up to now highlights the importance and
potentiality of the architectural space and its configuration, that is, the order of the spatial
relationships the building consists of. These configuration aspects acquire a significant role
in the healthcare center when they relate to functional and organizational relationships based
on the architectural project. Space analysis allows us to visualize it as potentially occupied by
user groups. In architectural composition, the relationship between user and architect is very
close and contributes to creating the physical environment.
This study has fielded fundamental reflections on strategies related to the design of the
first-level health architectural space, considering the perspectives of users on health
outcomes. It can be seen as a challenge that should be assimilated into the routine
configuration of health structures by professionals and health teams. Only in this way will a
new space of action for architects be opened, essential to the healthcare building’s full
development in its heal and care mission. Combining evidence-based design with
improvements to spatial design processes and the user experience and perception of the
building design will provide thoughtful reflection and guidance for clinical architect
collaborators who intend to build functional, flexible and quality environments"
10.1177/19375867221137099,Making Space for Midwifery in a Hospital: Exploring the Built Birth Environment of Canada’s First Alongside Midwifery Unit,2023,"Background: Canada’s first alongside midwifery unit (AMU) was intentionally informed by evidence-based birth environment design principals, building on the growing evidence that the built environment can shape experiences, satisfaction, and birth outcomes. Objectives: To assess the impact of the built environment of the AMU for both service users and midwives. This study aimed to explore the meanings that individuals attribute to the built environment and how the built environment impacted people’s experiences. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study using a grounded theory methodology for data collection and analysis. Our research question and data collection tools were underpinned by a sociospatial conceptual approach. All midwives and all those who received midwifery care at the unit were eligible to participate. Data were collected through a structured online survey, interviews, and focus group. Results: Fifty-nine participants completed the survey, and interviews or focus group were completed with 28 service users and 14 midwives. Our findings demonstrate high levels of satisfaction with the birth environment. We developed a theoretical model, where “making space” for midwifery in the hospital contributed to positive birth experiences and overall satisfaction with the built environment. The core elements of this model include creating domestic space in an institutional setting, shifting the technological approach, and shared ownership of the unit. Conclusions: Our model for creating, shifting, and sharing as a way to make space for midwifery can serve as a template for how intentional design can be used to promote favorable outcomes and user satisfaction. © The Author(s) 2022.","Canada’s first alongside midwifery unit (AMU)
opened in Markham Stouffville Hospital,
Ontario, in July 2018. The AMU is a physically
separate birthing unit governed and staffed by
midwives. The unit is in close proximity to the
labor and delivery (L&D) unit, so that in the event
of an emergency, patients can be easily moved.
For more detail on the setup and function of the
AMU, see Cameron et al. (2019). The design of
the AMU was informed by existing evidence on
the impact of the built environment on birth outcomes (Breedlove & Rathbun, 2019; Hodnett
et al., 2009; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence
et al., 2013; Newburn & Singh, 2003) and
through the use of an evidence-based guide, the
Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool
(BUDSET; Foureur et al., 2010; Jenkinson
et al., 2014). The BUDSET is based on a set of
birth environment design principles and is used to
measure the optimality of birth settings (Foureur
et al., 2010). The built environment refers to surroundings created for humans, by humans, that
provide the setting for human activities and
includes everything from landscapes to infrastructure to cities themselves (University of Windsor,
2021). The AMU’s built environment encompasses
the physical rooms as well as the architecture,
d´ecor, tools, and amenities available, including the
labor rooms, bathrooms, and common spaces.
Compared to conventional hospital units, the
AMU was purposefully designed aesthetically as
a “home-like” environment and was equipped to
provide comprehensive intrapartum care. While
we describe the AMU as “home-like” and much
of the literature describes creating domestic birth
spaces, we explicitly recognize that the concept
of “home” is not universal. It is important to
deconstruct this term which is pervasive in the
research. In general, “home-like” is used to imply
a place of safety, security, autonomy, and
domesticity; however, this may not be true for all
childbearing people, and for some, home may be
an unsafe place (Fannin, 2003; Michie, 1998).
The intention underlying the terminology is that
the space is less institutional, more personal, and
more familiar (Nilsson et al., 2020).
Review of the Literature
The physical environment significantly influences service user’s feelings of safety, relaxation,
sense of comfort, well-being, control, stress levels, satisfaction, and outcomes during birth
(Newburn & Singh, 2003; Rudman et al., 2007;
Setola et al., 2019). Further, these experiences,
satisfaction, and outcomes can be improved
through the incorporation of domestic features
(Foureur et al., 2010; Hammond, Homer, et al.,
2014; Mondy et al., 2016; Newburn & Singh,
2003; Nilsson et al., 2020; Rudman et al., 2007).
For example, flexible birth rooms that give people
the freedom to ambulate and give birth in upright
positions can result in fewer epidurals, shorter
labors, and fewer caesarean sections and are associated with fewer babies requiring admission to
intensive care (Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence
et al., 2013). The tools and furniture in birth rooms
that allow free positioning throughout labor and
birth contribute to improved outcomes by fostering
relaxation and supporting physiologic birth processes (Hammond et al., 2017; Igarashi et al.,
2014; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence et al.,
2013; Nilsson et al., 2020).
For healthcare providers, improving workplace design in healthcare settings has been
shown to reduce stress, enhance safety, productivity, job satisfaction, and quality of care. This
includes attention to the layout and configuration
of the unit and birth room, the flexibility of
the space, light and color, visual and sensory
190 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
elements, a social room for healthcare providers,
and incorporating elements of nature (Setola
et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2008).
The design of the birth environment has been
shown to influence job satisfaction and the way
healthcare professionals provide care, which in
turn may also impact birth outcomes (Hammond,
Foureur, et al., 2014; Hammond, Homer, et al.,
2014; Ulrich et al., 2008). Traditional hospitalbased birthing units have been identified as sometimes being a challenging setting for midwives, as
the environment is perceived to be overly medicalized and not designed to facilitate or support
care that optimizes physiologic birth and may
even directly hinder it (Foureur et al., 2010;
Hammond et al., 2013; Hammond, Homer,
et al., 2014). An improved birth unit design,
therefore, must support the physical, functional,
and psychological needs of midwives to support
the provision of quality care and meet the needs
of the person giving birth (Hammond, Homer,
et al., 2014).
The purpose of this study was to assess the
impact of the built environment of the first Canadian AMU for midwifery service users, along
with the midwives who work there. Our specific
objectives were to explore the meanings that
individuals attribute to the built environment and
to explore how this influences satisfaction with
birth space.
Method
Study Design
We conducted an explanatory, sequential mixed
methods using a grounded theory methodology.
This study was one component of a concurrent,
multiphase, mixed-methods evaluation of the
AMU, involving both midwives and midwifery
service users. Ethics approval was granted by
both the Markham Stouffville Hospital (Protocol
#78-1808) and Hamilton Integrated Research
Ethics Boards (Protocol # 5050 and 5056).
Sociospatial Conceptual Approach
Our study was informed by a sociospatial conceptual view of the birth environment. From this
perspective, the birth environment is defined as
not only a physical space but also a place that has
meaning and value invested within it by the people who interact with it. The birth environment is
shaped by what is physically in the room, such
as the design elements, equipment, and the
architecture, but also by broader sociocultural
expectations, norms, and influences, which are
constructed in part by the thoughts, feelings, and
responses of the people who use and interact with
the environment (Hammond et al., 2013). We
used this approach in developing our research
questions and data collection tools.
Recruitment and Inclusion Criteria
Our study population included midwifery service
users and midwives. Everyone admitted to the
AMU, including individuals whose care was later
transferred to an obstetrician on the L&D unit
during the intrapartum period, was eligible to participate in the study (Figure 1). We recruited
these participants during two time periods,
September 2018–March 2019 (Phase 1) and
September 2018–March 2020 (Phase 2). They
completed a consent to contact prior to hospital
discharge and a survey link was emailed 2-weeks
later. The survey included an invitation to participate in a follow-up interview conducted by telephone. All midwives who attended births at the
AMU from January to July 2020 were eligible to
participate and were recruited via email.
Data Collection
Midwifery service users completed an online survey, followed by an individual interview. Midwives participated in either an individual
interview or a focus group. The survey and interview questions for all participants, developed by
our research team, explored experiences of the
built environment of the AMU, including how
they used the space, their satisfaction, and evaluation of the equipment available to them. Individual interviews, completed via telephone, and the
focus group, conducted in person, were conducted by an experienced researcher and audio
recorded. We obtained informed consent from all
Murray-Davis et al. 191
individuals prior to their participation in all surveys, interviews, and focus groups.
In keeping with grounded theory approaches,
we conducted data analysis concurrently with
data collection to facilitate the iterative process
of constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss,
1967). Decisions to refine the interview guide
were made during peer debriefing meetings and
agreed on by the research team. We revised the
client Phase 2 survey and interview guide after
interim data analysis revealed that the physical
environment was an important factor shaping
birth experiences. As a result, the Phase 2 survey
and the interview guide were modified to
include more explicit questions about the impact
of the physical environment. We continued
recruitment until data saturation was reached
and no new data was emerging from the interviews (Sandelowski, 1995).
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed sequentially. First, we
analyzed the quantitative survey data. Descriptive
statistics were used to present the survey data
using Microsoft Excel. The Likert scales were
Figure 1. Mixed-methods research design.
192 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
collapsed into a three-point scale (Agree, Neutral,
and Disagree) and summarized into percentage
proportions. Next, we used grounded theory to
analyze our qualitative data. Specifically, data
collected from interviews were transcribed verbatim, read line-by-line, and open coded by three
researchers. To ensure reliability between coders,
codes were reviewed as a team to ensure agreement. We created categories by identifying relationships between related open codes; next, we
clustered categories together to form themes
(Charmaz, 2003). These themes were used to
develop a theoretical model. Triangulation of
multiple data sources, methods, and investigators
was used to ensure reliability and validity of our
findings (Carter et al., 2014).
Results
Fifty-nine service users completed the survey.
Twenty-eight services users and 11 midwives
participated in interviews and three midwives
participated in one focus group (Figure 1).
The majority of midwifery service-user participants had postsecondary education, earned a
total household income above US$100,000 per
year, and were similar in age (Table 1). Participants identified as East Asian (8.5%), South
Asian (15.3%), White-European (13.6%), and
White-North American (47.5%). Due to the small
number of midwifery participants, we did not collect detailed demographic data to preserve their
anonymity; however, most of midwives had
worked 3–10 years in healthcare (40.9%) and
worked at that hospital between 3 and 10 years
(45.5%; Table 2).
Quantitative Findings
The survey findings indicated that service users
were highly satisfied with their experiences in the
AMU and with elements of the built environment.
Components of their experiences that were rated
as highly satisfying included: the check-in/welcome experience (93.6%), atmosphere (97.9%),
physical space (93.4%), the tools and equipment
available (83.2%), and the accommodations made
for family members (84.0%; Figure 2). In terms
of birth equipment, the peanut ball (49.1%),
murphy bed (42.4%), and birth chair (37.3%)
were used most frequently, while the birth pool
(3.4%) and sling (0%) were least frequently used
(Figure 3).
Qualitative Findings
Our interview findings confirmed and expanded
on the survey findings and supported the development of a theoretical model, whereby “making
space” for midwifery in the hospital contributed
to positive experiences and overall satisfaction
with the built environment of the AMU. “Making
space” is accomplished through three crucial
steps: creating a domestic space in an institutional
setting, shifting the technological approach, and
sharing ownership of the space (Figure 4). We use
“making space” both literally, as the AMU is a
separate physical space designed and built in the
hospital, and figuratively, as midwives and their
service users were given the space, power, and
freedom to labor and birth independently according to midwifery philosophies of care (Figure 5).
We review each theme below and participant
quotes have been organized by theme in Table 3.
Creating a Domestic Space in an Institutional
Setting
The AMU was designed to look and feel cozy,
relaxing, comfortable, and intentionally different
from the traditional hospital environment, which
participants described as “cold and sterile.”
Despite being located within the hospital, the
atmosphere, aesthetics, spaciousness, and the
ways it supported family members all contributed
to the AMU feeling more domestic than institutional. The atmosphere was described by midwives as being quiet, calm, spa-like, and very
welcoming to families.
Service users chose similar words to describe
the atmosphere and went further to articulate that
it felt private and intimate and noted the atmosphere was very different from a hospital ward.
Multiparous people who had previously given
birth on the traditional labor unit noted that the
AMU was calmer in comparison. The AMU aesthetics included soft wall colors, nature murals,
artwork, birth affirmations, and soft furniture
Murray-Davis et al. 193
(Figure 6). Service users appreciated that the
space’s design and aesthetic felt very intentional
to support the philosophies of midwifery care.
They described how the ambiance, including
music and lighting customization, contributed to
their comfort and relaxation in the space, feeling
strongly that their surroundings impacted their
mood and birth experience.
Both service users and midwives enjoyed the
spaciousness of the AMU and birthing rooms.
The AMU was less crowded and busy than the
traditional labor unit due to fewer people, fewer
visible supplies, and medical equipment, resulting in more open spaces (Figure 7). The midwives
noted that the birthing rooms were free from
“clutter”—such as the traditional hospital bed,
pumps and preprimed intravenous sets, and most
obstetric equipment, making the room feel more
spacious. The service users appreciated the sense
of space they felt in their room.
A major design element of the AMU was to
create an environment that felt more like a

domestic space than a hospital. Service users
commonly described the AMU as “the best of
both worlds,” meaning the best of homebirth and
hospital birth combined. This referred to the ability to have a home-like environment while still
being in the hospital, with quick, easy access to
obstetrical care if needed, unlike at a planned
homebirth. The space also accommodated and
supported partners and families through the family lounge and kitchen, comfortable furniture,
and the birthing room being large enough to comfortably accommodate their presence. Families
also expressed feeling welcome in the space by
AMU staff, noting that the space was set up to
support their involvement in the birthing
experience.
Overall, the ambiance, aesthetics, and familyorientation created a domestic space that contributed to feelings of comfort and relaxation.
Shifting the Technological Approach
The design of the AMU moved away from the
biomedical and technological focus of childbirth
characterized by a reliance on technology. This
shift occurred by removing from the birth space
much of the technology that was not routinely
used. The primary motivation for this was to
decrease access to unnecessary equipment and
therefore demonstrate respect for judicious rather
than routine use of technology. Put simply, if the
continuous fetal heart rate monitor is present in
the room, it will be used. However, this removal
of equipment had two consequences. First, it
reduced the amount of unnecessary equipment,

which created more open space for people to
move about and labor freely. Second, it allowed
for the introduction of nontechnology-based labor
and birth tools and equipment. For example, since
the traditional equipments, such as the fetal heart
monitor, obstetric bed, and neonatal warmer.
were brought in only when needed, items to support physiologic birth, such as bars, slings, mats,
and birth stools, were prioritized and visible. On
the traditional labor ward, these tools had previously not been available, not accessible due to
space limitations. By comparison, in the
purpose-built AMU, these tools and equipment
were at the midwife’s fingertips and promoted
their use to support physiologic birth (Figure 8).
The tools were conveniently located, and they
had more of these tools at their disposal than ever
before.
Service users enjoyed and appreciated the
variety of resources available since it gave them
more opportunities to find the right tool or position while coping with contractions. However,
some service users felt they needed better education about the tools, how to use them, how they
were beneficial in labor, and at what stages in
labor they were helpful. Without this information,
clients often refrained from using the equipment
at all. For example, some service users reported
not knowing about the ability to control the lighting and music in the room.
Overall, both service users and midwives
reported that removing and modifying the technology and equipment in the birthing room created a space that was flexible and usable.
Midwives had the ability to remove, move, or add
equipment as necessary to accommodate the
needs of each individual. The open space facilitated mobility, freedom of movement, and the
ability to use more of the space.
A unique design feature of the AMU birth
spaces was the replacement of traditional hospital
beds with a queen-sized murphy bed that
was folded down from the wall only when in use
(Figure 9). This shifted the focus away from the
bed being the center of the room. The bed was
hidden until needed, which provided more space
in the room for the client to use, be mobile in, and
have family present. The midwives described that
ideally the bed would only be used for postpartum
recovery, but many service users still expected
they would labor and give birth on a bed and
desired this experience. Feedback from service
users indicated that they appreciated the murphy
bed particularly in the postpartum time when they
could relax and bond with their baby. They also
liked that it was big enough to fit their partner.
Not having the bed directly available really reinforced movement and encouraged service users to
try other tools and equipment. However, while
there were benefits of this style of bed, it was

Creating a domestic

institutional setting
Service user
I liked the peacefulness of it. It felt very relaxed and Zen ... . compared to a regular
hospital unit where you have four people in a triage room, and you have people
screaming, and people all around you, this was much more secluded, much quieter,
which really made me feel like I could relax during labour, which I really important
to me
It didn’t feel like a typical hospital room by any means, with the beautiful murals, and
everything, it just kind of provided a different atmosphere, and I also loved the option
for calm hallways where we could walk as I was labouring, and read the motivational
quotes on the wall
It was just enough space. It wasn’t too crowded. It allowed me to bring my belongings
and allowed me to walk around the room without having to feel like everyone was
around me that it was too close, so I liked our actual room, and it was very private
and just the perfect size.
I am so happy I went through that method, because you really have the comfort and
relaxation as if you were in a home setting, but still have the expertise and the team
available to you to make everything go smoothly.

It was a really good set up for my partner. The rooms have comfy couches. They have
lounge chairs. There’s a kitchen. Partners can be looked after and feel part of the
process too, I think, as much as they can
They had lots of space so that my family could be in the room with me, which was

It seems quiet. Even when we’re really, really busy, it never feels as loud or as busy as it
did over on labour and delivery
MW-B: It’s just less cluttered, too, with less people milling around. There’s less
bothering them, so it feels just like an organized space so you could come in and be
ready to do what you need to do
MW-C: and you go over [to L&D], and It’s almost like the walls are coming in on you
and I think, too, because There’s so many more people in the same space, whereas
you come over here and you might only have one or two people on the entire unit
I think it’s the space itself is really helpful to labouring women, because the attempt was
to make it more of a homelike experience, because often when they’re leaving home
and then coming into a new environment, it can be a bit stressful, which can shut
labour down a little bit, slow it down. So the attempt to mimic a homey type
atmosphere, I think, is encouraging to the labour progress itself

The birthing rooms were great. The Jacuzzi tubs were great. I laboured in that for a bit.
They had bars along the wall to help to squat or whatever and whatnot during
contractions. The birthing stool was awesome, the Murphy bed. No, overall, the
environment was great... . This is also why I went the midwifery route is because
you can labour in whatever way you want, right? And there were just so many

bars on the wall, I could do it on the bed. I was on all fours on the ground. I was in the
birthing stool. I was lying flat on the floor. There was tons of space around me and I
think that allowed me to kind of like be in whatever position I wanted, which is
exactly what I needed
The ability to move around. It was really accommodating to being in labour I felt. Just
having ... the space to really labour in different ways was fantastic. It made it feel not
closed in or anything or rushed. It just kind of felt like ... the space was there to use
as we needed it, which was great. It felt like our space
I think having it being able to kept away gave us that extra space for me to pace and just
even allow us labouring in the one spot, just that openness helped
Midwife
Yeah, it’s a hospital room. Don’t get me wrong. There’s oxygen on the wall, there’s all
of that, but there isn’t a lot of clinical equipment. So there isn’t that anxiety that
comes right away, I’m in a hospital room with a bed and a warmer and all of those
things. It’s all tucked away. It’s all hidden, it’s covered
There’s just so many options that the women and the clients, they’re all up to try
anything. And it’s almost like the midwives will have a bigger toolbox full of tools that
they can use. I mean sterile water, the TENS machine. They can bring the mom and
put her in the bathtub or they can do a water birth if they want. There’s so many
more tools that we can use
It felt like we didn’t really use the entire room before on the other unit, like it was the
same space and everything, but I felt like we used half of the room ... whereas now
it’s kind of like no, just use the whole thing. Like I find that even, I get them to sit on
the chairs that were designated for us and like just anywhere. Live your life anywhere
in this room, the whole thing is yours. I see more clients pulling out their personal
belongings... pictures and things to make it feel a little bit homier for themselves
[O]ne of the outcomes of the physical space, I know has been to encourage more
physiological positioning in labour, more upright positioning in births and that is
definitely something the way that the physicality of each room is laid out, that it really
enables that. Anybody’s who has sort of worked in the birth environment will know
that if you bring somebody labouring into a room and there’s a bed there, it’s very
easy for that person to just climb into the bed and lay there. But we know that that’s
not the best place to labour. So in our rooms, the bed is not immediately visible
unless this client is requesting an epidural and we know that that’s in their birth plan
and that’s what they’re going to do when they become active in labour. And that’s
definitely something that I’ve seen as well. It’s very clear that like clients are more
physiological in their labouring rather than sort of gravitating towards a flat surface
and lying down
For the most part, the Murphy beds are tucked away. They’re there when women need
to relax after birth. Or if they need a little rest during labour, they can lie on their
side on this Murphy bed that pulls down. But ambulation, upright posture, in a
Rebozo sling type device, in the water, all of these approaches to supporting
labouring people are well supported by the research literature to help facilitate
normal physiologic birth

articulated as not being ideal for perineal suturing
due to its low height, which placed ergonomic
strain on midwives.
Sharing Ownership of the Space
We found that all users of the space, service users,
midwives, and family described a sense of individual ownership over the space. For midwives,
this stemmed from the space being solely for midwifery care and governed and run by midwives.
The governance of this space was an important
aspect of ownership, as midwives were able to
create their own care standards based on
evidence-based midwifery approaches to care.
Midwives recounted how this facilitated a sense
of power and autonomy, knowing that the space
was designed specifically to support their

[We] have a pantry and the working environment for the midwives, there’s a team

sure that they have space that they call their own

them don’t even know about like a birth ball is helpful
I find having the couches out of there makes the partner be more involved. And it’s just
a chair that’s not super inviting and then having us be in the whole space, it’s like you
have to be involved or otherwise you’re just in the corner. Yeah, they’re really
engaged and they like all the stuff. They seem to like all the things we have

philosophy of care and validated their work. Service users supported this sentiment, valuing a
space that was designed to promote the type of
care and birth philosophies they were seeking
when choosing midwifery care. Features like the
staff room and meeting rooms gave midwives a
sense of belonging and camaraderie that had been
missing since they had never previously had dedicated spaces in the hospital.
Those birthing on the unit demonstrated multidimensional ownership of the space, by taking
control of their physical surroundings and their
birth experience. In the birthing room, they had
flexibility to modify the space, including the
equipment, labor tools, and furniture. They also
had the ability to personalize the lighting and
music and were encouraged to bring personal
items to make the space more comfortable, such
as LED candles, pictures, and curated music playlists. The birthing room was described as a space
that became their own, almost an extension of
their home. The built environment also facilitated
greater ownership over the birth experience. This
was achieved by using a variety of birthing tools,
hydrotherapy, and movement into various positions for laboring and pushing, and ambulating
in the room and in the hallways. Midwifery service users expressed feeling a sense of control
over their experience as a result of having more
options. The midwives noted that ownership and
customization of the space contributed to relaxation, improved outcomes, and an overall better
birth experiences for service users.
Finally, family members also shared in this
sense of ownership since they were able to be
an integral part of the birth experience. All participants expressed appreciation that families had
enough space in the birthing room to settle in and
be comfortable, without feeling crowded and that
spaces such as the lounge and kitchen accommodated families. Additionally, the midwives
believed that partners were more involved in
labor support on account of the increased space
and room for movement.

Discussion
This study, underpinned by a sociospatial conceptual approach, used grounded theory to explore
the impact of the built environment of Canada’s
first AMU from the perspective of both midwives
and service users. The findings revealed that the
intentional design elements of the unit facilitated
positive experiences and contributed to greater
satisfaction with the birth experience. We attribute these positive experiences to three key ways
of “making space” for midwifery-led birth—creating a domestic space in an institutional setting,
shifting the technological approach, and sharing
ownership of the AMU (Figure 5). These findings
contribute to the growing literature advocating
for the benefits of evidence-based birth unit
design (Berg et al., 2019). Framing these findings
within the sociospatial approach, it is clear that
the experiences of midwives and service users
were not due to the space alone, but how the
space was used, which was co-created by everyone who entered the unit, and was underpinned by
midwifery philosophies (Figure 5).
Our results support previous research, which
emphasized the importance of ownership and
control in the birthspace (Igarashi et al., 2014;
Mondy et al., 2016; Setola et al., 2019). The birthing rooms and family lounge contributed to families feeling welcomed and involved in the
birthing process (Mondy et al., 2016; Nielsen &
Overgaard, 2020; Setola et al., 2019). The unit
was described as “the best of both worlds,” a
similar finding to that of Kuliukas et al. (2016)
in a co-located birth center in Australia (Kuliukas
et al., 2016). These findings support offering a
third option to give birth, as neither home nor
traditional hospital may be the optimal fit.
The flexibility of the space was a key component to participants’ satisfaction, making it easier
for midwives to fully promote physiological birth
and giving birthing people ownership and options
(Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014; Setola et al.,
2019). It is important that this flexibility was
recognized and utilized by both care provider and
service users since the birthing environment must
meet the needs of everyone in the space (Dana &
Wambach, 2003; Setola et al., 2019; Skogstro¨m
Figure 9. Double murphy bed.
Murray-Davis et al. 203
et al., 2022). In traditional hospital labor wards,
midwives often attempted to modify the physical
environment to try and make the space more
domestic or to facilitate normal birth (Bourgeault
et al., 2012; Davis & Homer, 2016; Igarashi
et al., 2014) but were constrained by what the
space would allow (Mondy et al., 2016). Our
findings are in line with those of Hammond et al.
(2013), demonstrating that the ways in which
midwives use the birth space is impactful, as
midwives were more effective at promoting
physiologic, low risk birth when working in an
environment that supports their professional
needs (Hammond et al., 2013).
Our findings stress the impact and importance
of midwives feeling a sense of ownership and
belongingin the birthspace. Previous findings from
Bourgeault (2012) found that midwives felt like
visitors in labor wards and guests at homebirths
and described “borrowing space” that explicitly
did not belong to them (Bourgeault et al., 2012).
This newfound sense of ownership, belonging and
control described by midwives on the unit is an
important finding and warrants further research
to explore how this impacts practitioner confidence, professional identity, and job satisfaction.
As now neither a visitor in clients’ homes, nor
guest in the labor ward, midwives working on the
AMU exist in a liminal space, which Brown et al.
(2017) described as phenomena that do not fit
into normal categories but fall “betwixt and
between.” The unit is neither home, nor hospital,
yet has overlapping elements with both. The
liminality of the unit is potentially why the space
is so effective for clients and midwives, as its
flexibility allows the space to be used in whatever
ways are needed by clients or their caregivers.
The space can become whatever is desired, providing both parties a sufficiently strong internal
locus of control to feel a sense of ownership of the
space. Its character as neither home nor institution alleviates the risk narrative of home birth,
and the flexibility of the space allows for the tenet
of choice to be made manifest.
Implications for Practice
As Canada’s first AMU, this analysis is critical
for identifying factors that should be considered
when designing future birth spaces to optimize
the environment for all. Our model for creating,
shifting, and sharing as a way to make space for
midwifery approaches can serve as a template for
other centers looking at intentional design to promote favorable outcomes and user satisfaction.
This model of care and the intentional design
of the birth environment may be an important
component to midwifery retention, which is an
ongoing problem globally. In a recent study in
Western Canada, one third of midwives surveyed
had seriously considered leaving the profession
(Geraghty et al., 2019). The literature thus far has
not specifically addressed what impact the physical environment and its association with autonomy may contribute to midwife job satisfaction
and attrition. However, our findings suggest that
this type of model may help contribute to better
midwifery retention through both cognitive and
physical benefits. Decreased stress levels, greater
satisfaction at work, and the shift away from hierarchical power structures may address common
sources of burnout (Bloxsome et al., 2019; Geraghty et al., 2019; Stoll & Gallagher, 2019).
There are further implications to using “homelike” as a design goal. From an equity lens, there
may be a benefit to the unit having a stereotypical
“home-like” aesthetic, as it provides an alternative to homebirth for those who don’t have a
home-space that provides the same safety, comfort, ambiance, and spaciousness as the AMU.
Our mixed-methods approach strengthened
the study as we were able to confirm our findings
through data triangulation. Limitations of the
study stem from the fact that we did not collect
data from patients with other care providers at the
same hospital, nor did we investigate midwifery
service user’s experiences in the traditional labor
ward prior to the opening of the midwifery unit.
Also, our findings may not be generalizable to
other communities due to the specific demographics of the midwifery population who
participated.
Conclusion
The built environment of AMU resulted in positive experiences and satisfaction among all participants. The domestic environment was relaxing
204 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
and comfortable for those in labor, while still
maintaining proximity to emergency care. This
purpose-built space designed with equipment and
resources to support midwife-led care encouraged
flexibility and choice for those giving birth.
Finally, the built environment led to a greater
sense of ownership for all those giving and
receiving care. This went beyond the space and
how it is designed, to include how it was used
and co-created by midwives, service users, and
their families.
Implications for Practice
 To optimize the birth environment for all,
institutional birth settings should consider
incorporating domestic elements and demedicalizing the space to promote midwifery
approaches to care which support physiologic birth.
 Midwifery ownership and self-governance
contribute to how the space is used and
co-created with service users. This agency
and ownership foster a sense of belonging,
which is an important contributor to healthcare provider job satisfaction.
 A positive built environment for the birth
setting may have a meaningful impact on
addressing attrition and retention in the midwifery profession through decreased stress
and increased job satisfaction.
 Optimizing the birth environment can
improve childbirth satisfaction among
women and birthing people and their families. But service users need to be informed
about how to optimally interact and make
use of the space during the antenatal period.

10.1177/19375867221148168,Evidence-Based Design in the Hospital Environment: A Staff’s Burnout Study in the COVID-19 Era,2023,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the evidence-based design of the hospital physical space effect on the burnout of nurses and physicians during COVID-19. The research question was to identify the connection between daylight, nature-view windows, and hospital staff burnout during Covid-19. Background: The evidence-based design in the hospital environment affects the health of the medical staff. The promotion of the hospital environment has a significant effect on healthcare system improvement. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 406 nurses and physician’s burnout in Guilan province in 2020. Three questionnaires were used: demographic, physical space of the hospital, daylight, nature-view windows, and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Logistic regression (LR) analysis was used to determine the association between burnout and the hospital environment. The significance level was considered with p <.05. Results: The results showed statistically significant correlations between patient units and the environmental characteristics of the hospitals with staff’s burnout (p <.001). Of note, 62.9% of physicians and 71.9% of nurses had moderate work-related burnout. The highest burnout score was seen among staffs of emergency departments adjusted multivariate LR model revealed that 27.1% of work-related burnout in nurses and physicians was predictable with age, light, marital status, and hospitals. Our results showed that accessing more daylight could reduce burnout (p =.018, odds ratio [OR] = 0.910). Conclusion: Based on the result, the daylight impact on burnout reduction is more significant than other factors. It is suggested that adequate lighting, proper environmental design, and nature-view windows could create appropriate space for enhancing medical staff satisfaction and reducing burnout. © The Author(s) 2023.","The number of People with Dementia (PwD) is rising worldwide. World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1).
Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2).
This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,
 
learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD.
It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented
 

 

as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5).
In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6).
The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,
 

and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7).
Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns.
There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,

that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14).
Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related.
In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).

1.1        Research gap

In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research.
There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have.
The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of
 

fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).

2.        Materials and methods

This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research.
The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users.
A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy.
The survey consists of:

1.        identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development)
2.        choice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition)
3.        processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)

The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare
 

 

facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.

2.1        Assessment framework development from the case study analysis

The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing
- thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).

2.2        Web-based survey definition

The survey was divided into 4 parts:

1.        The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only.
2.        The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.
 

3.        The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question.
Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD.
The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development:
-        location,
-        shared spaces,
-        paths,
-        living areas,
-        external spaces,
-        technologies,
-        bedrooms.
4.        In the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.

2.3. Data collection and analysis

The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible.
The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...).
It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer.
The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.

3.        Results

The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.
 


 
Figure 2. Analysis table for case studies.
 

 

The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid.
The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined.
This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces.
Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.
 

3.1.        Section 1 – Statistical data

The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).

3.2.        Location

The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).
 
3.3.        General aspects

As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about
10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development.
However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.
 


 

Figure 7. The questionnaire results about the general idea about the structure of healthcare facilities for the elderly.




Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
3.4.        Distribution

56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8).
It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.
 
3.5.        Living area

The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9).
Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,
 


 

Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.



Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.

3.6.        Outdoor space

The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,
 
such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.

3.7.        Future trends

Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a
 


 

Figure 11. The opinion about the future of healthcare facilities.

prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11).
This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.
 
3.8.        Personalization

The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners.
In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a
 

 

viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.

3.9.        Other considerations

The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire.
These can be divided into three main themes:

A)        Issues related to the content:
-        I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff;
-        In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process;
-        Single room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside;
-        I believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”;
-        A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration;
-        Fundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important
 

to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife;
- I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community;
B)        Issues related to the form and process of the survey:
-        Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions;
-        Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities;
C)        Issues related to staff training and education:
-        All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself );
-        Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces;
-        It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and
 

 

chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.

3.10.        Comparison of the results

The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses.
Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,
 

favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).

4.        Discussion and conclusion

The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with

the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed.
The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.

5.        Research limitations and future developments

The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage
 

and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents.
However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

10.18848/2325-1662/CGP/v17i02/61-81,Designing a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit by Employing an Evidence-Based Design Approach,2022,"This literature review study aimed to develop a set of key evidence-based design considerations for a prototype (3-Dimensional) cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) that promotes patient health and safety as well as staff work efficiency. To provide convergent evidence about the association between cardiac intensive care and the physical environment, searches were conducted in the PubMed, Google Scholar, and other databases as well as in certain specialized journals. The inclusion criteria included qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods studies, or systematic reviews; written in English; and related to the built environmental design of cardiac intensive care. The contents of the selected articles were first extracted and then analyzed and synthesized. The results of this review demonstrated that the CICU physical design had a strong influence on patient health and safety. A total of more than forty CICU design recommendations were identified. In practice, all environmental and nonenvironmental factors should be holistically considered in the design decision-making process. The next step is the development and testing of prototypes that incorporate relevant design strategies before wide application. This literature review disclosed the key design strategies that enhance the physical design of CICUs. Further research is needed to evaluate the prototype and to investigate the future needs and issues in designing CICUs. © Common Ground Research Networks, Ahmad E. Alansari, Xiaobo Quan, Some Rights Reserved.","ardiac intensive care units (CICUs), in particular, and intensive care units (ICUs), in general, 
are considered to be the most complex places in a hospital. CICUs (also called cardiac care 
units, acute coronary care units, or critical coronary care units) provide special, systematic, 
team-based critical care to patients recovering from cardiac surgeries and patients with severe 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs—serious or life-threatening heart conditions such as heart attacks, 
acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure) and complications such as renal failure 
and respiratory issues (Loughran et al. 2017). Like CVDs, health conditions treated in ICUs are often 
the leading causes of deaths as well as elevated healthcare costs in the United States and other countries 
(e.g., Bowry et al. 2015; Dasta et al. 2005). 
Intensive care medicine was developed over 60 years ago and has evolved in order to better 
manage critical ill patients through temporarily supporting or replacing the functions of major 
organ systems (Kelly et al. 2014). However, hospitals face several challenges, including hospitalacquired infections, patient falls, and nurse back pain and injury, in intensive care. These safety 
and quality issues may lead to negative patient outcomes, increased mortality, and waste of
precious resources. The successful management of these issues constitutes a key component of
the successful delivery of intensive care. 
ICUs are specialized healthcare settings that require high levels of staffing and intensive use 
of technology and other resources. Because of the high acuity levels and complex conditions, 
patients in CICUs and ICUs require continuous and close monitoring by clinicians with special 
training (Kasaoka 2017). As a result, the staff-to-patient ratio is much higher in these units than 
typical medical–surgical care units. Furthermore, many types of specialized technological 
equipment (e.g., electrocardiography, intra-aortic balloon pump, mechanical ventilator) are used 
in intensive care for patient monitoring and treatment (Kasaoka 2017). In addition, patient

experiences of intensive care are quite different from those of patients in other healthcare settings. 
Hooked up to wires and tubes, patients typically spend several days to several weeks in ICUs 
with limited awareness of their surroundings (Katz et al. 2010). All the aforementioned unique 
features of intensive care should be thoroughly considered in the process of quality improvement 
aiming at reducing costs, improving healthcare outcomes, and enhancing patient experience. 
Role of the Physical Environment in Healthcare 
The physical environment of ICUs may play a significant role in improving healthcare safety and 
quality. An increasing number of research studies published in many disciplines (e.g., medicine, 
nursing, building design, engineering) have clearly demonstrated the critical effects of the
physical environment on key patient and staff outcomes, including healthcare-associated 
infections (HAI), patient falls, medical errors, patient anxiety, pain, patient satisfaction, job 
satisfaction, work efficiency, and work-related injuries (Ulrich et al. 2004, 2008). 
Much healthcare environment design research has been conducted in ICUs; therefore, their 
findings may be directly applied to ICU design. For example, single-bed rooms were found to be
associated with significant reduction of respiratory, urinary tract, and catheter-related infections as well 
as length of stay in a pediatric ICU (Ben-Abraham et al. 2002). Another recent study compared two
ICUs and found that patients younger than 65 years were less likely to experience delirium in the unit 
with single rooms and windows than in the other unit that featured windowless multibed rooms 
(Arenson et al. 2013). In a coronary critical care unit (CCU), researchers found that the installation of
sound-absorbing ceiling tiles led to shortened reverberation times and improved speech intelligibility 
as well as reduction in staff members’ self-reported work demands and strain (Blomkvist et al. 2005). 
Findings from a variety of other healthcare settings may also be adapted to inform ICU design 
decision-making or design innovation. For example, a study conducted in outpatient medical offices 
indicated a positive correlation between environmental attractiveness and higher levels of perceived 
quality, satisfaction, and staff interaction and lower patient anxiety (Becker and Douglass 2008). The
installation of ceiling lifts in an extended care facility significantly reduced staff injuries related to
patient handling, days lost, workers’ compensation claims, and direct costs associated with patient 
handling injuries (Chhokar et al. 2005). Visual artworks were found to help reduce the anxiety and 
agitation of psychiatric patientsin a mental health facility (Nanda et al. 2011). 
These research efforts have resulted in substantial increases of the amount and quality of
evidence that should be continuously tracked and applied in practice to maximize the benefits for 
patients, families, staff, and healthcare organizations. 
Translating Research Evidence into Design Innovations 
Evidence-based design (EBD) is a process of environmental design that utilizes credible research 
evidence and methodology to improve outcomes (The Center for Health Design, n.d.). EBD is an
example of translational research that facilitates the application of research findings by creating 
design resources and tools that meet practical needs. It addresses the disconnect between research 
and design often observed in the environmental design field. The disconnect partially originates 
from the fact that peer-reviewed research journal articles published in medicine and other 
scientific disciplines are difficult for many design professionals to access and understand. To
address this problem, many extensive literature reviews have been conducted in recent years on
various EBD topics to make the research knowledge readily available to practitioners. Examples 
include a comprehensive review conducted by Ulrich et al. (2008) on all environmental elements 
that impact healthcare outcomes, a systematic review focusing on long-term residential care 
facilities (Joseph, Choi, and Quan 2015), and a systematic review on how maternity room design 
may impact maternal and neonate outcomes (Nilsson et al. 2020). However, it remains a challenge 
to periodically update the reviews and stay current with the latest developments in research.

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
Another potential cause of the gap between research and design is the lack of easy-to-use EBD 
resources and tools as well as compelling EBD examples that show how research findings from
different sources may be integrated to create design solutions or innovations that significantly 
contribute to the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery. One example of design 
resources is the “Guidelines for Intensive Care Unit Design” developed by a multidisciplinary team 
on the basis of research evidence and expert knowledge (Thompson et al. 2012). Another type of
effort is the development of prototypes for healthcare environments that visually demonstrate all 
relevant EBD features, which would effectively speed up the translational research. This research 
study is one step toward developing such a prototype of evidence-based CICU design. 
Aim of the Study 
This research study aimed to develop a set of key EBD considerations for a prototype (3-
Dimensional) CICU that would promote patient health and safety while reducing staff stress and 
fatigue. As the first step in developing the prototype, a literature review was conducted to update 
previous reviews by examining the most recent research around ICU environments. 
Research Question 
What are the main environmental design features that promote patients’ health and safety in the CICU? 
Methodology 
The literature review process involved three main steps: establishment of a conceptual 
framework, literature search, and literature analysis and synthesis. 
Conceptual Framework 
The conceptual framework for EBD developed by Ulrich et al. (2010) was adopted to guide the 
literature search and review. In this framework, the built environment design variables are 
classified into nine categories: 
▪ Audio environment (e.g., sound-absorbing characteristics of finishes, acoustic walls)
▪ Visual environment (e.g., windows, building orientation)
▪ Safety enhancement (e.g., staff visual access to patients, handwashing sinks)
▪ Wayfinding system (e.g., building entrance, signage)
▪ Sustainability (e.g., building mass, building envelope)
▪ Patient room (e.g., single room, same-handed layout)
▪ Family support spaces (e.g., overnight bed in patient room)
▪ Staff support spaces (e.g., decentralized nurse station, proximity of supplies)
▪ Physician support spaces (e.g., operating room, air quality, lighting)
These design variables directly impact healthcare participant outcomes, including patient outcomes 
(e.g., hospital-acquired infections, sleep quality, length of stay), family outcomes (e.g., quality of
communication, stress, satisfaction), physician and other staff outcomes (e.g., work performance, 
perceived fatigue), and organizational outcomes (e.g., cost, revenue). The relationships between design 
variables and outcomes are mediated by confounding factors, including demographics and 
organizational factors such as culture, occupancy rate, and nurse-to-patient ratio. 
Literature Search 
A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. The methodology of conducting research 
from the literature review involved the thematic approach, in which credible scholarly journal articles 
focusing on the physical environment’s impacts on patients and nurses in CICUs were searched and 
reviewed. An initial search of the literature was conducted using several databases, including Google 
Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. The criteria for inclusion included the following: 
63

THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN 
▪ Empirical research articles published in peer-reviewed journals
▪ English language
▪ Publication between 2000 and 2019
▪ Evidence on connections between environment design and healthcare outcomes that
potentially can be used to inform ICU design
A list of keywords, including design variables (e.g., layout, lighting) and outcomes (e.g., infections, 
patient falls), adapted from the conceptual framework was used in the literature search. Additional 
articles were extracted from relevant literature reviews that were conducted previously. The 
abstracts and full-text articles were examined to eliminate those that did not meet the criteria for 
inclusion. The process resulted in a short list of relevant articles for further analysis. 
Data Extraction and Synthesis 
The shortlisted studies were transferred from the source databases to Excel, and then the 
publication information was documented in Excel. The researchers reviewed all the study 
findings. Finally, forty-four research articles (various types, including original research, literature 
review, methodology, and expert consensus) found to be relevant met the requirements of the 
review and the aim of this study. The included articles were reviewed twice by the researchers 
for relevance, and their contents were first extracted and then analyzed and synthesized. The 
credibility of the research evidence was evaluated according to widely accepted criteria of
empirical research (e.g., Pati 2011). Different aspects of design were coded to generate themes, 
and related concepts were clustered together under the emerged themes. 
Results
An ICU typically contains a variety of spaces (e.g., patient rooms, workstations, corridors) for
different user groups. This section first summarizes the design considerations applicable to all 
spaces and then focuses on recommendations for the spaces used only by a specific group of users—
patients, families, or staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, and other staff). See the complete list 
in Table 1. The last part includes the recommendations around the design process of considering the 
relevant factors and integrating multiple features into the best design solution.

Safety Enhancement 
The physical environment plays a critical role in enhancing healthcare safety (Joseph, Henriksen, 
and Malone 2018; Olmsted 2016). An important design consideration for healthcare environments 
such as ICUs that impacts not only safety but also work efficiency is the visual sightline connection 
between various spaces (e.g., workstations and patient rooms). In a qualitative study conducted by
Pati, Harvey, and Pati (2014), visibility was reported by healthcare professionals as one of the top 
issues around emergency department (ED) safety and efficiency. Several key visibility design 
recommendations may be applicable to ICU design: locating the unit entrance in the direct sightline 
of reception and security, providing visual connection between different clinical work zones, and 
designing unit layout (e.g., corridor shape, workstation location) to maximize visibility from
workstations to patient rooms (Pati, Harvey, and Pati 2014). Physicians and nurses reported that 
greater levels of visibility led to increased productivity and teamwork efficiency, and contributed to
higher security (Gharaveis et al. 2018).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
One of the goals of improving visibility for patient monitoring isto reduce patient falls, which 
poses a serious challenge in ICUs and may result in injuries, extended hospitalization, and high 
costs. However, there is no single “silver bullet” for fall prevention, and a multifaceted solution 
that includes education, communication, environment, and medication should be used to
minimize the incidence of falls and injuries (Rowe 2013). Among environmental factors, certain 
flooring, such as carpets, may help reduce patient’s fear of falling, incidence of falls, and severity 
of injuries related to falls (Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). A 
retrospective analysis of patient fall reports revealed several environment contributors of patient 
falls: uneven floor surfaces, poor nighttime lighting, and limited visibility for surveillance 
(Bayramzadeh, Portillo, and Carmel-Gilfilen 2019). 
HAIs are infections that people acquire when they are receiving healthcare services. HAIs may 
cause high morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay and suffering, rehospitalization, high 
costs, and dissatisfaction (Ulrich et al. 2008). The following design features have been found in
research as contributors to HAI prevention: physical separation between patients (e.g., single-bed 
rooms with private bathrooms), accessible hand hygiene sinks and gel dispensers, high-efficiency air 
disinfection and filtration, interior finish materials that are easy to clean and maintain (Nanda, Malone, 
and Joseph 2012; Ulrich et al. 2008). A 2006 study found that vinyl flooring was more durable and 
easier to maintain as well as produced lower VOC emissions (Lankford et al. 2006).
Medication errors are preventable mistakes in the process of medication use (e.g., preparing, 
dispensing, and administration) that could potentially cause harms to patients. Research has found that 
medication errors could be reduced by providing high-illumination task lighting and reducing 
unexpected noises in staff work zones (Ulrich et al. 2008). Dedicated medication rooms should provide 
adequate spaces for staff members with minimal disruptions (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; 
Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). Acuity-adaptable rooms were designed to accommodate patients 
through different levels of care; therefore, they may help reduce the necessity of intra-hospital 
transfers—a source of medical errors (Hendrich, Fay, and Sorrells 2004).
Security, or the prevention of violence, is an important subset of healthcare safety. It turns 
out that visibility also significantly impacts security. As Gharaveis et al. (2018) found, staff 
members recommended visual surveillance over the unit entry as well as open layout and 
decentralization that facilitated undisrupted sightlines. Additional design features recommended 
for security included traffic management (e.g., one-way traffic) and dedicated areas for special 
populations (e.g., mental health patients) (Gharaveis et al. 2018; Pati, Pati, and Harvey 2016). 
Visual Environment 
Patients in ICUs often experience negative mood states such as anxiety and fear. The ICU visual 
and audio environment constitutes an important factor determining patient physical (e.g., sleep 
disturbances) and psychological experiences (e.g., anxiety, depression; see Topçu et al. 2017). 
Appropriate visual stimuli should be incorporated in the environmental design to speed up recovery 
by alleviating the negative moods. The provision of positive distractions and natural daylight has 
been found to effectively reduce stress and improve outcomes (e.g., better sleep at night, faster 
recovery). High levels of daylight (as measured by the daylight factor—the ratio of the daylight 
level inside a building to the daylight level outside) were associated with a shorter length of stay in
a U.S. hospital and a Korean hospital (Choi 2004). Nature images with sky and trees generated 
higher ratings in perceived pleasantness and activated brain regions associated with general positive 
feelings, as shown in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Pati et al. 2014). 
Simulated nature scenes presented on ceiling-mounted fixtures may provide frontal exposure of
nature to patients in a supine position. Research found that such positive distractions significantly 
improved patients’ satisfaction with the room environment and reduced their blood pressure levels 
(Pati et al. 2014). Data also showed the potential benefits of this intervention in reducing anxiety, 
pain, and medication use (Pati et al. 2016a). Nurses’ exposure to nature views (through windows

accessible from work areas) was associated with significant reductions in acute stress and increases 
in alertness (Zadeh et al. 2014). In addition, the visual appeal (i.e., attractiveness) of the built 
environment was found to impact a healthcare facility’s public image and make it easy to recruit 
physicians and other staff members (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016). 
Furthermore, research is beginning to shed light on other visual design topics. For example, a 
team led by Pati et al. (2016b) examined the effects of curved and pointed sharp-angled features in
healthcare building images on fear responses as measured by amygdala activation in fMRI brain 
scans and self-reported preferences of healthy adults. Overall, the study participants reported high 
preferences for images with curved objects. However, brain scans indicated significantly higher fear 
response associated with curve contours in healthcare interiors (Pati et al. 2016b).
Audio Environment 
In busy environments like an ICU, noise is a serious problem that causes sensory overload, stress, 
sleep disruptions, dissatisfaction, interferences with oral communication, and low work efficiency 
(Devlin and Arneill 2003). Effective noise reduction measures include the use of sound-absorbing 
materials such as carpets in patient rooms and corridors, and the location of potential noise sources, 
such as paper towel dispensers and ice machines, away from the patient rooms (Devlin and Arneill 
2003; Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). One effective example of patient 
room design for noise reduction included a “technical corridor” behind the patient head to house 
noise-generating medical equipment with a sound-blocking wall between the space and patient 
head; the environmental modification significantly reduced ICU room noise level, especially at
night (Luetz et al. 2016). In addition to noise reduction, the audio environment can be improved 
through the provision of relaxing music and nature sounds (Devlin and Arneill 2003; Ulrich et al. 
2008). Patient control of environmental elements, such as television volumes, may enhance the 
sense of control—a central component of patient-centered care (Devlin and Arneill 2003).
Wayfinding System 
The difficulty in finding one’s way without getting lost has been a chronic problem in healthcare 
facilities that are typically large and complex. The wayfinding issues may cause stress, frustration, 
and fatigue in patients and visitors as well as waste in staff time due to late or missed 
appointments. Pati et al. (2015) conducted a qualitative study to identify key physical
environment elements that may play a critical role in assisting wayfinding. Ten adults were 
instructed to complete simulated wayfinding tasks in hospitals. Data was collected through 
questionnaire surveys, verbal protocols that aimed at catching every thought occurring during 
navigation, and verbal directions provided by staff members. The study identified a set of
wayfinding design elements, including the following (Pati et al. 2015): 
▪ Signs, including the labels of rooms or spaces, directional signs, and any images, logos, 
or symbols indicating space functions 
▪ Information cues provided by architectural features, including views of exterior and 
multilevel interior views provided by atriums 
▪ Maps illustrating the global structure of the building 
▪ Logical clustering of spaces with related functions (e.g., entrance and admissions) 
▪ Furniture that may suggest the functions of spaces 
▪ Interior elements (artwork, display boards, information counters, wall color, vending 
machine, etc.) that could serve as familiarity markers of the anchor points 
These recommendations are consistent with those of other relevant research studies (e.g., 
Devlin 2014).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
Patient Room
One hot debate topic in healthcare design is whether patients should be cared in single-bed units 
or open bays. Research has strongly recommended single-bed patient rooms because of the 
associated benefits in communication, infection prevention, noise reduction, sleep quality, and 
patient and family experiences (Taylor, Card, and Piatkowski 2018). 
Beyond the issue of single-bed versus multibed rooms, research has also looked into other topics 
such as the relationships between different components of a patient room. In a simulation study of two 
ICU mock-up rooms, Chisholm et al. (2008) identified several design considerations: (1) using ceilingmounted articulating arms (i.e., booms) that provided easy access to outlets and equipment and at the 
same time reduced clutter, (2) positioning the patient monitors to improve visibility and usability, (3)
maximizing clearance around the bed to increase accessibility of equipment and avoid collisions, and 
(4) using easy-to-use intercom systems to facilitate communication between nurse stations and ICU 
rooms. Similarly, the size of spaces (e.g., patient room size, doorway width) was perceived by hospital 
administrators as an important factor that impacted healthcare safety and work efficiency (Pati, Gaines, 
and Valipoor 2016). Adequate spaces should be provided for the use and storage of all equipment that 
may be used in intensive care (e.g., physiologic monitoring, ventilator) (Department of Veterans 
Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012).
In another study, Pati et al. (2009) examined the importance of various patient room layout 
design elements as perceived by nine designers and five nondesigners (clinicians, patient, family 
member, nursing educator). The top-ranked design considerations included spatial clearance 
around bed, access to patient (including patient’s head), staff’s visibility to patient, unobstructed 
and quick path for staff to access patient from corridor, and patient access to bathroom. The 
fourteen participants were then instructed to rate six room configurations that varied on three key 
design variables: same-handedness (i.e., same-handed vs. mirrored layout), the location of
bathroom in relation to the exterior wall and corridor (i.e., outboard, inboard, and a combination 
of the two), and the location of bathroom in relation to the patient (i.e., footwall vs. headwall). 
The results showed that outboard and footwall bathroom locations were rated relatively higher 
than other options (Pati et al. 2009). 
To examine the environmental factors contributing to falls, Pati et al. (2018) analyzed the 
videotapes of 180 trials in which subjects were instructed to act as patients and perform scripted 
tasks of unassisted ambulation (e.g., walking from bed to bathroom) in a physical mock-up of
patient room. The coding of video data showed that certain actions (e.g., turning, pulling, pushing, 
bending forward, grabbing, and sitting) contributed to fall initiation. The following physical 
environment elements might impact the likelihood of engaging in the aforementioned high-risk 
actions and contribute to falls: (1) bathroom door type and direction of swing, (2) bathroom layout 
(e.g., spatial relationships between door, toilet, and sink), (3) hardware design (e.g., door, toilet), 
(4) clearance within the clinician zone, and (5) clearance around patient bed (e.g., spatial 
relationships between bed, chair, overbed table, and bathroom door) (Pati et al. 2018). 
Additionally, the installation of video surveillance systems in patient rooms might be an effective 
fall-reduction intervention (Cournan, Fusco-Gessick, and Wright 2018). 
The safety and efficiency of intensive care could potentially be improved through 
standardization on the basis of lessons learned from other industries. While standardization may 
occur at a wide range, from furniture or equipment to the whole unit, same-handed room 
represents an example of standardization at the level of patient room design. Pati et al. (2010) 
further examined the effects of the same-handed room concept in a simulated study, during which 
the activities of twenty registered nurses performing tasks (i.e., taking vitals, suctioning, sitting 
up patients) on a patient-actor were videotaped and analyzed. However, data provided little
support to the notion that nurses should consistently position on the patient’s right side. It was 
suggested that same-handed room configurations might not lead to more standardization in
process and workflow than the standard mirrored design of patient rooms (Pati et al. 2010).

THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN 
Biomechanics data from the same study indicated that 87 percent of the harmful and stressful 
actions (e.g., twisting, bending) during nursing care were associated with the use of equipment 
(e.g., bed, headwall); only 13 percent were related to room configuration issues (e.g., location of
IV pole, approach direction). This finding suggested that room layout standardization alone might 
not effectively improve the biomechanics of nursing care, and consequently, may be limited in
reducing the risk of staff back and musculoskeletal injuries (Pati et al. 2012). Another recent study 
showed several benefits of same-handed room, including lower noise, better sleep, and higher 
satisfaction; however, other differences between the same-handed rooms and the mirrored rooms 
were not controlled in the study (Watkins et al. 2011). 
Family Support Spaces 
Patient rooms are where visiting family members spend the most time with patients to provide 
physical, emotional, and social support. According to a questionnaire survey conducted by Philips 
(2012), the interactions between patients and their families would be enhanced through the 
provision of seating and sleeping accommodations, personal storage spaces, shelving to display 
personal items (e.g., gifts, flowers), accessible lighting and television, sound-absorbing finish 
materials, and appropriate furniture design (e.g., movable chairs) in the patient and family zones 
that supported family–patient interactions (Philips 2012). Similarly, interviews with four families 
of pediatric patients at CICUs and ICUs revealed several design recommendations to support 
families: layout that allowed easy communication between family and patient (e.g., shorter 
distance, direct visual contact); movable furniture (e.g., chair, overbed table); dedicated shower 
and toilet so families could stay close to patients; noise and light control (e.g., blocking of light 
from corridor, removing alarms from rooms); access to electric outlets, wireless connection, 
television, and other technology; and a communication board with plenty of information for 
families (Evans and Thomas 2011). Additional amenities for families should be provided in the 
unit. These amenities could include family lounge near patient rooms, communication 
technology, consultation rooms, meditation spaces, sleeping rooms, nourishment, bathrooms, and 
family laundry (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). 
Staff Support Spaces 
The decentralized nursing model is designed to bring nurses and supplies closer to patients by
distributing multiple nurse workstations across one unit. It is believed that decentralization may help 
improve visibility for patient monitoring and assistance as well as reduce staff walking distance, and 
therefore, increase the proportion of time spent by nurses in direct patient care. However, research 
on the decentralized design has reported mixed results. For example, a study found that nurses spent 
more time on administrative tasks (e.g., charting) but also engaged in more social interactions and 
consulting with other clinicians in units with centralized workstation design (Zborowsky et al. 
2010). In a before–after study, nurses spent less time in fetching supplies, and therefore, worked 
more efficiently after they moved from nursing units with centralized nurse stations to new units 
with decentralized nurse stations, but their walking distance increased and the self-reported 
collaboration level decreased (Pati et al. 2015). Other empirical studies showed similar patterns: 
decentralized nursing stations tended to improve patient experience but impede nurse teamwork 
(Fay, Cai, and Real 2019). Another study reported that the centralized design interfered with 
communication between staff and access to patients (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016). Because of
the mixed results associated with decentralized design, researchers explored other design options. 
For example, a recent study evaluated the effects of a “multihub” design that combined central 
nursing hubs and decentralized charting alcoves (Hua et al. 2012). Although patient satisfaction 
appeared to increase after the movement from hospital units with centralized or decentralized 
designs to the “multihub” unit, nurse satisfaction and nurse communication with physicians failed 
to improve or even declined (Hua et al. 2012).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
According to reports from healthcare managers and frontline staff members, additional 
design features that support staff work include adequate spaces for the storage, use, and 
movement of equipment; ergonomic design (e.g., ceiling lift) that reduces risk of injury and 
improves efficiency; and an in-unit staff break room that is visually appealing (Pati et al. 2014). 
Additionally, there should be on-call spaces for staff to take short naps and sleep breaks, 
restrooms, and lockers next to the staff break room (Thompson et al. 2012). Adequate spaces 
should be provided for housekeeping rooms, clean workrooms, and soiled workrooms 
(Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). 
Integration of Multiple Design Features and Organizational Factors 
Healthcare outcomes represent consequences of the interactions between many factors from various 
domains, including environmental design, operations, culture, and finance (Pati 2020; Ulrich et al. 
2010). Through semistructured interviews, gaming, and shadowing, Pati et al. (2012) examined the 
organizational factors that impacted design decisions around flexibility (e.g., decentralized design, 
visibility). These factors included performance benchmarks, information technology, regulations, 
staff’s reluctance to adopt new technology, doctors’ expectations, human factors (e.g., perception, 
cognition), and financial factors (e.g., capital and personnel costs). A systematic approach that 
integrates all these factors (e.g., efficiency benchmarks for pharmacy, materials, and nursing unit) and 
design considerations (e.g., locations of nurse supplies) should be used to achieve the best possible 
outcomes (Pati et al. 2012). It has been recommended that multivariate models such as moderator and 
mediator models (i.e., models that include variables that impact or explain the relationship between a 
predictor and an outcome) should be developed and tested to optimize multifaceted solutions (Pati 
2020). A series of design tools (e.g., balanced scorecard, process analysis) can be used in the nonlinear 
iterative design process to discover the best options (Joseph et al. 2012).
The design of an ICU involves careful consideration of all key decision variables and 
constraints, such as model of care, service lines, budget, and existing structures. These 
considerations form the basis for determining the relatively higher priority goals for a building 
project and resolving possible conflicts between different design features. Ritchey and Pati (2008)
proposed a structured decision-making approach that aimed at balancing various goals and finding 
the “sweet spot” or the best design solution. They recommende"

Utilizing historical analysis, the hospital reveals contradictions frequently embodied by the era’s Modernist built environments. Inaugurated in 1907, the hospital was the culmination of the United States Smelting Refining and Mining Company (USSRMC) and its Mexican subsidiary, Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca’s (CRMyP) efforts to bring healthcare to its employees while maximizing production.

All rights reserved.","The Hospital Minero (Miner Hospital) in Real del Monte, 
in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico), is a building complex 
conceived, built, and operationalized at the height 
of Mexico’s Industrial Revolution. Utilizing historical 
analysis, the hospital reveals contradictions frequently 
embodied by the era’s Modernist built environments. On 
one hand, the hospital’s design and operation expressed 
an optimism wrought by the dissemination of positivist 
and utilitarian philosophies and economic growth 
spurred by technological innovation; on the other hand, 
the design expressed growing wealth inequality and 
deteriorating, often brutal, labor conditions. Nearly 120 
years later, the hospital once again embodies its global 
reality. In contemporary post-industrialist economies, 
once these built environments cease being productive, 
they are abandoned or demolished; only a few are 
transformed and repositioned for other uses. Most 
recently, the Miner Hospital, an architectural expression 
which fused global and local economic, technological, 
and aesthetic sensibilities, was transformed into the 
Museum of Labor Medicine (Museo de Medicina 
Laboral), an example of didactic heritage.
On February 12, 1906, the United States Smelting 
Refining and Mining Company (USSRMC) purchased 
the Compañia Real del Monte y Pachuca’s (CRMyP), its 
mines and claims, marking a convergence of specific 
geographic conditions, and hundreds of years of 
geopolitical and economic factors. Located in Hidalgo, 
CRMyP was the latest acquisition in a global purchasing 
spree that included mining interests in Peru, Russia, 
Canada, and across the United States. Optimistic 
about the company’s financial future because of newly 
introduced technology, particularly electrically powered 
machinery, the company began operations by replacing 
outdated technology and reducing dependency 
on human labor. Consequently, mine productivity 
dramatically increased; however, so did the number of 
miners brutally injured or killed during work shifts. 
Immersed in the period’s sociopolitical and economic 
tensions, the USSRMC and local miners sought a 
reconciliatory approach, partnering to build a then 
state-of-the-art hospital, Hospital Minero de Real del 
Monte, to serve the miners’ medical needs. Nearly 100 
years later, after being abandoned, the hospital became 
part of Mexico’s tangible heritage when it was converted 
into a didactic museum, the Museo de Medicina Laboral 
(Museum of Labor Medicine). Today, visitors to the 
museum can not only learn about Mexico’s mining 
history, early twentieth-century medical technology, 
and the brutal conditions that helped give birth to the 
country’s labor rights movement, but also confront the 
contradiction between Modernism’s promise of progress 
and the realities wrought by scientific innovation and a 
market-driven global economy. 
1.2. Development Plan
First, the essay situates the hospital within a 
philosophical, sociopolitical, and economic context 
across a regional and global scale. It includes Real del 
Monte’s geography, mining legacy and cultural history, 
to explain how the hospital was conceived at the height 
of the region’s mining productivity. Subsequently, the 
essay analyzes the development of the hospital’s design, 
construction, and operation to demonstrate how the 
hospital revealed, and later the museum’s curated 
collection (including the buildings themselves) exhibits, 
various Modernist ideas derived from Modernism. Next, 
the case study documents within a larger sociopolitical 
and economic context, why the hospital, was first 
ceded to the public sector, then abandoned, and finally 
transformed into a museum. Currently, as part the 
region’s built heritage, the museum maintains itself by 
commodifying a historical narrative forged by globally 
influenced, but site-specific, regional economic realities. 
1.3. Theoretical Framework
This essay utilizes Perry Anderson’s argument that 
Modernism is not defined by a singular philosophy 
or aesthetic approach, but rather as a historical 
movement that disrupted older sociocultural norms 
and possessed a sense of urgency (1984, 112-13). One 
strain of Modernism, rooted in French positivism and 
British utilitarianism philosophies, promoted rationalist 
scientific processes to identify and address a range of 
social, economic, and technological challenges. For its 
part, Modernist architecture “grappled” with this strain 
of Modernism, by engaging in its “discourse” through 
spatial expressions (Goldhagen 2005, 145). 
As countries embraced, or were subjected to, globalized 
trade and industrialization, these philosophies, 
generating Modernist built environments across the 
world, like the hospital, which embodied the era’s 
zeitgeist and its intrinsic aporic contradictions. Because 
as Sophie Forgan argues museum “[b]uildings are 
artefacts in themselves, created at considerable expense 
and reflecting the intellectual and material context of 
the society in which they were founded,” it is possible 
to examine the museum’s spatial identity through a 
material culture lens (2005, 574). Where spatial identity 
is a “perceived image” produced by aesthetic and 
functional characteristics, which generate recognizable 
spatial expressions (Rogers, Castree, and Kitchin 2013). 
Today’s museum, seen as an iteration of a continuous 
spatial history, memorializes multiple, but convergent, 
spatial identities: site specific conditions, i.e., climate, 
topography, and geology, informed by local, regional, 
and global, technological, sociopolitical, and economic

forces, to produce a built environment that embodied 
its then contradictory realities. Today, the museum is 
part of the region’s tangible heritage precisely because 
visitors can experience how the hospital embodied, and 
now the museum exhibits, Modernism’s aporic zeitgeist.
1.4. Methodology
The essay examines the Museo de Medicinal Laboral as 
a case study that cross-references quantitative data, i.e., 
mining production and market values, with qualitative 
spatial analyses. Methodologies include the use of 
primary and secondary sources: Primary research was 
undertaken through on-site visits and consultation 
of primary ¬¬¬documentation, i.e., cotemporaneous 
periodicals, advertisements, corporate prospectuses, 
financial reports, trade journals, and other archival 
sources associated with the historic period. In addition, 
museum patrons and staff, including those who oversee 
its day-to-day operations, as well as members of the 
Archivo Histórico y Museo de Minería, Asociación Civil 
(AHMMAC), were interviewed. Secondary sources 
include peer-reviewed journal articles, booklets, books, 
blogs, contemporary newspaper articles, and other 
published material focused on the museum.
2. CONTEXT
2.1. Geography
To fully understand how a mining hospital embodies a 
confluence of geographic, economic, social, and political 
forces, it is important to examine the local, regional, and 
national context in which the hospital was conceived. 
The establishment of Real del Monte (hereafter Real) 
about 70 km northeast of Mexico City, can be traced 
to mining-related activities during the pre-Hispanic 
period.1
 The town’s approximately 11,150 residents live 
nestled in the Sierra Pachuca Range, situated 2,718 m 
above sea level, where temperatures occasionally dip 
below 0˚C generating light, but infrequent, snowfall 
during the winter, in a transitional area between 
the western slopes of the mineral-rich Sierra Madre 
Oriental and the eastern edge of the Central Mexican 
Plateau (PueblosAmerica 2022, para. 1) (Figure 1). Like 
the rest of Hidalgo, Real and its surrounding region lacks 
significant groundwater sources. Though rainfall can 
be acutely heavy, it is highly sporadic and confined to 
the summer months. Thus, major hydraulic, food and 
power infrastructure was required for a larger longterm population settlement. Real’s biome is typical 
of a transitional topography with xeriscapes hosting 
depleted forests. Over the last 500 years, surrounding 
forests were directly decimated by the mining industry 
which used wood for construction materials, i.e., mine 
rafters and wall blocking, and for fuel; and indirectly, by 
1 Officially renamed Mineral del Monte after Mexico’s 
independence in 1821.
using wood in the construction of the town’s changing 
built environment as it accommodated changes in urban 
scale, physiognomy, and morphology. 
2.2. Pre-Hispanic and Viceregal Era
Real’s region was a well-known mountain pass utilized 
by several Mesoamerican cultures, including the 
Toltecs, Chichimecs, and Otomí. The Otomí christened 
the area Maghotsi, or Paso Alto (High Pass), because it 
was routinely used to cross from the Gulf of Mexico’s 
coast to the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlan (Gobierno 
del Estado de Hidalgo 2010, 10). As early as 1324, the 
Chichimecs were mining silver and other minerals 
throughout the Sierra Pachuca area (7). 
In 1531, ten years after the Spanish conquered the 
Mexica Empire, the Spanish Crown officially recognized 
the region’s potential mineral wealth and placed the 
region and its inhabitants directly under the Crown’s 
purview, thereby acquiring the Real (Royal) name. Then 
in 1552, Alonso Pérez de Zamora, a former soldier in 
Hernán Cortés’ army, began mining operations; and 
shortly after, in 1555, Bartolomé de Medina would 
perfect the mercury-based “patio” method for silver and 
gold extraction, greatly increasing yields (Mendizábal 
1941, 255). 
2.3. Foreign Investment
Like most newly incorporated innovative technologies, 
initial applications maximized yields, even for 
mines previously considered exhausted; yet, like 
all technologically driven cycles, subsequent yields 
inevitably dropped as technology reached extraction 
capacity limit. Real was a profitable mining region during 
the Viceregal period, especially after 1750, when owner 
Pedro de Romero and Terreros (1710-81) introduced

new water-management techniques that generated a 
silver mining bonanza. Significantly, in 1766, the first 
labor strike erupted in New Spain when miners led by 
Nicolás Zavala (the museum’s cultural center namesake) 
protested unfair wages and working conditions. Only 
with Viceroy Joaquín de Montserrat’s (in office 1760-
66) direct intervention did miners return to work. By the 
last years of the eighteenth century, however, the mines 
had been abandoned, as decreasing profits no longer 
justified operational costs (Mendizábal 1941, 305). 
In 1824, when the Mexican government allowed 
for foreign investment, the British Real del Monte 
Company, based out of London, purchased the Romero 
de Terreros’ mines and claims and established the 
Compañía de Aventureros de las Minas de Pachuca y 
Real del Monte in Mexico. British investors, engineers, 
administrators, and miners, most hailing from Cornwall, 
sought to apply cutting-edge steam-powered mining 
technology to exploit Real’s mines. From 1824 to 
1849, the British invested 16 million dollars to produce 
11 million dollars of market-value ore. Arguably, the 
venture failed because of a strained relationship with 
the Federal government, six crippling labor strikes, 
expensive equipment, e.g., Cornish pumps “worth their 
weight in silver,” costly infrastructure improvements 
including supply and distribution roads, rail lines, and 
lower than expected yields (West 1907, 14). A year after 
the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the British 
company sold their interests to a Mexican venture, 
the Sociedad Aviadora de Minas de Real del Monte 
y Pachuca (CRMyP’s precursor) and abandoned the 
country (Randall 1985, 629). 
Despite the British corporation’s withdrawal, H.E. 
West in 1907, noted in The Mexican Mining Journal 
that the British had introduced the region to “modern 
times” (West 1907, 14). The British had, in fact, deeply 
influenced local society and its culture: families like 
the Rule, Straffon, and Ludlow, stayed and integrated 
themselves into local politics, industry, and commerce; 
British workers introduced Cornish pasties (meat pies), 
known in Mexico as pastes, to local cuisine; soccer began 
as a local pastime, but eventually became the national 
sport; and Protestantism, the prevalent faith among the 
Cornish, gained a toehold in a predominantly Roman 
Catholic country. Much of Real’s urban physiognomy 
changed because Cornish builders introduced doublepitched cottages roofed with red-painted corrugated 
iron metal sheets (Figures 2 & 3). Today, because 
of the architectural influence of Cornish vernacular 
architecture, Real has been dubbed “little Cornwall” 
(Cooper-Richet 2017).
2.4. Confluence of Local, Regional and Global Forces
The Miner Hospital represents the culmination of 
globalized sociopolitical and economic forces. After 
Mexican independence was finally consolidated in 
1821, unceasing political instability led to internal 
insurrections, coups de etas, and frequent civil wars 
that continuously undermined the nascent state. A 
politically weak Mexico was constantly engaged in civil 
conflict, and an easy target for foreign interventionism, 
expansionism and coerced territorial secession. e.g., 
Texas Revolutionary War (1835-36) and the MexicanAmerican War (1846-48). Significantly, conflicts drained 
the Mexican treasury, reduced natural resources, and 
further frustrated Mexico’s political development. With 
each devastating setback, the divide widened between 
those seeking a modernized state and those seeking to 
conserve the status quo. 
In 1857, a liberal constitution was adopted that enabled 
social reforms and overhauled the country’s legal 
framework, which included ceding mining regulations 
to states to provide the legal certainty needed to attract 
foreign investment (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 26). 
Then, in 1858 Benito Juárez, a liberal, was elected 
president. He pledged to enact significant legislation 
furthering political reforms codified by the Constitution 
of 1857, which sparked yet another civil war, the 1858-
61 Guerra de Reforma (Reform War). Exploiting Mexico’s 
weakened state, France successfully invaded Mexico 
in 1861 and imposed an Austro-Hungarian Habsburg, 
Maximilian I, as its Second Emperor of Mexico (1864-
67). Eventually, President Benito Juárez led a loyal liberal 
army and expelled the Europeans. During the relatively 
brief French occupation contemporary European 
philosophies and technology deeply influenced leading 
Mexican intellectual, military, political, and industrialist

figures, which became convinced that only transforming 
Mexico into a strong, sovereign, and modern nation, 
could prevent future calamities. 
2.5. Modernism and The Porfiriato
It is perhaps a historical irony that Porfirio Diaz, a former 
general who helped expel the French in 1867, turned 
to Europe, especially France, to model his government’s 
approach to Mexico’s modernization. While Modernism 
includes a multitude of overlapping paradigms, Mexico’s 
political, economic, and cultural development during 
Diaz’s administration were primarily influenced by two 
central ideas of European philosophical Modernism: 
August Comte’s positivism and John Stuart Mill’s 
utilitarian philosophy. 
Comte’s positivism held at its central promise “the 
formation of the new social system” (Comte 1998, 52). 
Positivism’s promise, it seemed, was reciprocated by 
market-driven innovation as entrepreneurs, scholars, 
and government officials, began to benefit from 
the Scientific Revolution’s ongoing contributions: 
technological advances spurred on innovation across 
industry, producing immense wealth among the 
growing European bourgeoisie classes. Economically 
liberalized states and their capitalist classes, enamored 
with positivism and Mill’s utilitarianist free-market 
approach, extracted wealth from labor and invested 
heavily in technologically driven market advantages. 
Eventually, after the initial industrialization boom, for 
many European countries economic growth would not 
be found in internal markets, but in financially favorable 
globalized resource extraction and trade. Inspired by

France and its globalized influence, by the nineteenth 
century’s last third Diaz’s government deployed 
positivism and utilitarianism to administer the country 
systematically. 
By the early 1890s, a group of positivist scientists, 
doctors, scholars, and bureaucrats, collectively known 
as the “Cientίficos” (Scientists), formed the core of 
Diaz’s politico-administrative State apparatus (María y 
Campos 1991, 125). By 1900, the government adopted 
the positivist motto “Order and Progress” (Comte 
2020, 55). Diaz’s administration, initially 1877-80, and 
continuously from 1884 to1911, utilized legal reforms 
enabled by the 1857 Constitution that “crystallized the 
laissez-faire trends begun by Benito Juárez” (Alvarez 
1987, 29). During his administration
the government encouraged foreign investment 
as its principal development policy. In addition 
to the problem of capital, Mexico also lacked 
the technical knowledge to promote the 
development and production of her economy. 
Díaz, who favored the development of the nation 
by the economically powerful, encouraged 
foreign investment through legal statutes that 
leaned heavily in favor of foreigners. (Alvarez 
1987, 29)
As a result, at first Diaz’s government successfully 
stabilized the country politically while achieving 
economic growth across all economic sectors—though 
not among all socioeconomic groups. However, no 
industry was more heavily favored than mining. Early 
in 1884, Diaz successfully promoted new legislation 
that brought much-needed legal and investment 
certainty to the mining industry, generating a flood 
of foreign investment into the sector (Kuntz Ficker 
2010, 166). Soon, other industries were reformed 
prompting additional foreign capital across all economic 
sectors. Mexico’s growing industrialist and middle 
class experienced impressive economic benefits. John 
Coatsworth remarks that 
Between 1877 and 1910 national income per 
capita grew at an annual average rate of 2.3 
percent, extremely rapid growth by world 
standards, so fast indeed that per capita income 
more than doubled in thirty-three years. (1978, 
81)
Steven Bunker further notes that Mexico’s emergent 
middle and upper classes’ “participation in this market 
exchange signified being part of Mexico’s modernization 
efforts” (1997, 228).
The Porfiriato, as the Diaz era is dubbed, forever changed 
the country’s architectural, urban, sociopolitical, and 
economic landscape (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 37). 
Burgeoning globalized demand for goods and services 
prompted more foreign investment in Mexico, which 
produced Modernist built environments, e.g., the 
hospital, to systematically meet new market demands. 
Economic success, however, came at a high social cost. 
In Germany, for example, social problems generated by 
industrialization and uneven wealth distribution were 
severe enough that, at the insistence of Chancellor Otto 
von Bismarck, it “became the first nation in the world to 
adopt an old-age social insurance program in 1889” (SSA, 
n.d.). More broadly, while Europe’s nineteenth century 
industrial and scientific development lead to impressive 
economic growth, it also generated socioeconomic 
problems leading to social unrest, revolutions, and 
continental war, e.g., 1848 and 1870-71. 
Similarly, Mexico’s economic success belied significant 
growing social and political problems as newly 
produced wealth became concentrated among foreign 
enterprises, national companies, relatively few families, 
and investment syndicates; equally contradictory, 
the modernization process produced mass rural 
migration to cities, where the impoverished urban 
population experienced deplorable living and working 
conditions. Moreover, far from producing a long-term 
stable and politically democratic state, the Porfiriato 
often undergirded its interests by frequently using 
violent force to support foreign investors, national 
political bosses, and business cronies—all ostensibly 
justified by advances in telecommunications, rail, port 
infrastructure, manufacturing, and a globally integrated 
banking system. Like Europe, Mexico’s successful 
industrialization and global market integration, 
generated latent aporias which became evident with 
the Miner Hospital.
Growing sociopolitical and economic discontent, 
already evident in the early 1890s, came to a head in 
the Mexican Revolution (c.1910-20) when peasants, 
farmers, and the working classes grew despondent 
as living conditions deteriorated (Tutino 2018, 174). 
Despite brutally suppressed labor strikes, especially 
in mining, the Revolution, political instability, and 
industrialized profits made Mexico an attractive mining 
region throughout the first half of the twentieth century. 
3. CONFLUENCE OF MODERNISM’S FORCES
3.1. Conception
With Mexico fully vested in attracting foreign 
investment, the United States Smelting Refining and 
Mining Company (USSRMC) incorporated in January 
1906 “to acquire other mining interests in Mexico and 
Nevada” (Strack, n.d., under “Overview”) Five days 
after the acquisition, the Mexican Herald (published 
in English) reported on February 17 that “[USSRMC] 
26
ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023
http://www. arcc-journal.org
intend putting into the company several million dollars 
into opening the mines, building mills, and in new 
equipment” (Mexican Herald 1906a, 7). Shortly after 
the purchase, the USSRMC executed its ambitious 
business plan. Confidently applying innovative electric 
technology, throughout 1906, the company rapidly 
replaced outdated British mining machines to ramp up 
yields at Real’s mines. 
In April, USSRMC purchased 4000 hp from the Canadianowned Mexican Light and Power Company (Mexican 
Herald 1906d, 1) and proceeded to build over 8000 
km of infrastructure tunnels to bring electricity to Real, 
and the entire region, to provide enough power for the 
mining equipment (Mota 2018). Through the end of 
1909, the company had installed nine electric winches, 
ranging between 110 and 250 hp, and compressors in 
each of its Real mines (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez 
Badillo 2005, 10). The combination of electric machinery 
and the newly perfected silver cyanidation process in 
1907, resulted in tremendous success: while in 1906 
USSRMC achieved just over 3.5 million dollars in net 
earnings, by 1910 it reported 3.74 million dollars in net 
earnings; its 7 percent preferred stock and 4 percent 
common stock yields easily surpassing expectations 
(Stevens 1911, 1737-38). 
Despite The Mexican Mining Journal’s assurance that 
“the successful operation of this big company on 
modern lines will prove undoubtedly of such benefit to 
the camp that those who have criticized will shortly be 
praising [emphasis added]” (Historic and Famous 1907, 
17): similar to the Porfiriato’s internalized sociopolitical 
contradictions, USSRMC’s mining success would reduce 
employment opportunities, and ultimately lead to a 
deadly toll on miners. The initial suspension of most 
mining activity, combined with workers replaced by “the 
latest and best machinery available” (Mexican Herald 
1906c, 11), led the USSRMC to lay off hundreds of 
miners; over 400 left the region to find work elsewhere 
causing generalized “misery” (El Pais 1906, 3; Mexican 
Herald 1906b, 11). As Alan Derickson observes
More than any other factor, the hazards 
of the job drove hardrock miners to create 
and maintain health and welfare programs. 
Accidents crippled and killed countless workers. 
Debilitating industrial diseases took a heavy 
toll. Industrialization exacerbated old risks and 
generated new ones. In particular, silicosis 
became rampant in the wake of the technological 
revolution of the late nineteenth century. (1988, 
30)
To be sure, new technology reduced certain mining 
risks but generated others, often with more severe 
adverse outcomes. For example, “[t]he introduction of 
electric locomotives […] meant that workers traded the 
risk of being kicked by mules for the increased risk of 
being squashed against mine walls by large engines” 
(Derickson 1988, 32).
Then, a significant mining event over 2,000 km away 
shook the North American mining industry. On June 1, 
1906, Mexican workers at the Cananea copper mine 
in Sonora, Mexico, went on strike demanding the 
Mexico-based US-owned Cananea Consolidated Copper 
Company end deteriorating labor conditions that had 
significantly increased casualties and establish wage 
parity. The company’s owner, William Cornell Greene, 
and Mexican government officials were unmoved by 
the miners’ demands. Mexican federal and local police, 
soldiers, company staff, and Arizona Rangers crossed 
the international border with the permission of Sonora’s 
Governor Rafael Izábal, and proceeded to brutally 
suppress the strike, injuring hundreds, and killing thirty 
miners (Cárdenas García 1998, 144). Though the strike 
ended four days later, the strike’s aftereffects, factored 
into the 1907 U.S. financial crisis and fueled grievances 
that culminated in the Mexican Revolution. Other 
mining operations, like USSRMC at Real, took notice of 
the catastrophic results.
Aware of increasing numbers and severity of mining 
injuries, USSRMC elected a different path: rather than 
risk a generalized, highly disruptive labor strike and 
violence that could endanger future production, the 
company negotiated with mining leaders. In September 
1906, USSRMC’s upper management, namely its 
Mexican operations manager Morril Spaulding and chief 
medical officer A.J. Hoskins, met with Real’s Mayor, 
Agustίn Straffon, and mining leaders to propose the 
construction of a new hospital. The hospital was to be 
a cutting-edge medical facility, with medical staff, from 
doctors to nurses, focused on the miners’ specific needs. 
There were precedents for a company-operated mining 
hospital. In the United States, the Miner’s Hospital in 
Hazleton, Pennsylvania, opened in 1889; and the Ereğli 
Company hospital at Zonguldak in the Ottoman Empire 
opened in May 1897 (Quataert 2006, 192). In Mexico, 
however, this would be the first hospital of its kind. 
Arguably, building and operating a mining hospital was 
a win-win scenario for the company: on the one hand, 
by providing miners and their families with healthcare, 
they could demonstrate genuine concern for worker 
welfare; on the other hand, building the hospital would 
not only quell any discontent regarding a lack of medical 
attention but also facilitate faster recovery of a labor 
force that represented a vital company investment in 
training and experience. At the meeting, the parties 
agreed to jointly develop the hospital immediately 
so miners would receive the best care possible for 
mining-related injuries and, when possible, facilitate 
27
ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023

and supervise rehabilitation programs for the injured 
(AHCRdMyP, n.d., 1). 
To finance the hospital’s construction, equipment, 
and operation, the agreement called for the miners to 
contribute, and the company to match, a one-time fee 
of five Mexican cents and an ongoing fee of between 
2 percent and 4 percent of miners’ wages during 
construction (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez Badillo 
2005, 12). Hospital construction began in late 1906 
on a 3,926 m2 parcel that was eventually ceded in 
September of 1908 by the workers in exchange for the 
company’s continued maintenance of facilities and staff 
salaries (Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.). Belem Oviedo, head 
of the museum’s supervisory and administrative trust, 
notes that when the hospital was finished, it was “one 
of the most beautiful, modern, and functional hospital 
buildings of its era” (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez 
Badillo 2005, 12). Once in operation, the hospital was 
initially staffed by Hoskins, two assistant physicians (one 
Dr. Nájera, a Mexican national), a Matron (chief nurse), 
five assistant nurses, and a pharmacist. The first Matron, 
Nelly Zurhaar, arrived in 1907 from the Netherlands and 
would head the staff until her death in 1959. 
4. DESIGN STRATEGIES OF HOSPITAL MINERO
4.1. Architectural Zeitgeist
Little is known about the hospital’s designers, as the 
construction drawings were prepared by USSRMC 
engineers and signed by an “E. Islas.”2
 However, it is 
possible to gain some insight into the region’s design 
zeitgeist from contemporary newspapers. A German 
engineer, Ernesto Fuchs, who had emigrated to 
Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 1870s, had designed and 
was supervising to great acclaim the construction of the 
Bank of Hidalgo in Pachuca, the state’s capital (Figure 4). 
While the bank’s façade was an eclectic mix of European 
Neoclassical motifs and styles, Fuchs channeled the 
era’s emphasis on modernity, stating that the building 
“is entirely of steel and stone construction” and the 
“interior finishing of the building is in accordance 
with the most modern ideas [emphasis added]” 
(Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.).
4.2. The Hospital
The hospital embodied multiple ideas associated with 
nineteenth century Modernism; its existence evidenced 
Mexico’s globally driven industrialization and was 
conceived as part of an overall strategy to increase 
labor productivity. Positivism and utilitarianism had 
prompted typological evolution in response to empirical 
observations, a parti that prioritized functional 
processes over all other considerations, integration of 
the latest technology, and the use of globally fashionable 
or recently adopted pragmatic aesthetic vocabularies, 
e.g., red corrugated iron roofs, interpreted with local 
materials, to express a modern identity. 
Though there is evidence that hospitals have existed 
as a spatial typology since Mesopotamia or Dynastic 
Egypt, it would be in the nineteenth century that 
significant innovations transformed hospitals “from 
traditional charitable institutions […] to modern 
medical institutions” (Kisacky 2019, 288). Many of these 
innovations were proposed by an English nurse, Florence 
Nightingale, “the Angel of the Crimea.” After heavy 
losses by the British during the Crimean War (1856-58), 
Nightingale was dispatched to the Bosporus (Turkey) to 
improve conditions for wounded soldiers. Despite initial 
opposition from British doctors, Nightingale successfully 
reorganized the medical facilities and vastly reduced the 
mortality rate among the wounded.3
 She, and her team 
of nurses, were able to do so by introducing several key 
modifications to traditional hospital design and patient 
care that would later be evident in the design of Real’s 
mining hospital. In the spirit of positivism, Nightingale

3 At the time, reduction in the rate of mortality was 
consciously misreported by British authorities to increase moral 
among troops, however, actual mortality rate decreases were still an 
extraordinary achievement.

codified her design ideas in “Notes on Hospitals”, which 
became the international bible of late nineteenthcentury hospital design, correlated hospital mortality 
rates to hospital layouts as a means of assessing the 
healthiness of hospital building design” (Kisacky 2017, 
23). 
Real’s mining hospital displayed various avantgarde design strategies associated with Modernist 
architecture. The first of these characteristics was its 
siting: not only was the hospital conveniently located 
atop one the highest of Real’s urbanized hills and roughly 
equidistant to three major mine heads, but following 
Florence Nightingale’s guidelines, it was located outside 
of the town’s denser urban fabric, where patients could 
enjoy a quiet environment along with a continuous 
supply of fresh air to prevent airborne contagion 
(Kisacky 2017, 25). Moreover, its location followed 
the pattern where “smaller rural hospitals served a 
specific community in facilities that typically included 
only necessary medical spaces and technologies but 
provided more personalized care” (Kisacky 2019, 290). 
The hospital’s master plan (Figure 5), unchanged to 
this day, is composed of a courtyard surrounded by 
three individualized single-storied masses running 
east to west. In keeping with “the hospital designs of 
late eighteenth-century Europe,” the campus’ plan 
“maximized air flow and quality by structuring the 
hospital as a collection of small buildings, each filled 
with a narrow, linear room, disconnected from other 
spaces and surrounded by open air” (Kisacky 2017, 15)
The longest volume, nearly 60 m long, runs parallel to 
the aptly named Hospital Street on the campus’ ¬south 
side and is the hospital’s main public façade. Unlike the 
Bank, the use of Cantera (ash stone) was limited to an 
approximately 1.5 m tall base course (Figure 6). 
Above that, its upper molding band persists throughout 
the courtyard elevations but not the Cantera plaques. 
Above this base is a series of alternating orange brick 
and locally collected cobblestone bands, ending with 
concrete quoins that mark folding planes. These 
Romanesque-like striations, however, do not repeat 
in other façades. Instead, all other exterior facades 
are composed of vast cobblestone planes, interrupted 
by windows framed by dematerializing orange brick 
surrounds. The use of stone in this fashion was 
consistent with traditions brought by the Cornish. As 
Gerda Peterich notes, this type of cobblestone masonry 
originates 
in traditions of rubble wall techniques imported 
from Europe, particularly from England, where 
it served the demands of the pioneer farmers 
especially well, as the gathering of stones cleared

their fields, and the building material could be 
accumulated at convenient times […] (1956, 12)
The willful adoption of the foreign Byzantine-like façade 
striation, executed with local materials, suggests a 
global architectural outlook: the use of readily available 
cobblestone to build English-type walls, combined with 
the Cornish-type red corrugated iron roofs, points to a 
local re-interpretation of imported building traditions.
The street-facing massing has two entrances: the 
easternmost, a porte-cochere gate, is bounded to 
the north by a colonnade separating a roofed but 
horizontally open area from the courtyard beyond; to 
the west is the main or civic entrance, recognizable 
from the street by its large, horizontally protruding 
volume. From this civic entrance starts the campus’ 
main north-south organizational axis. Once past the 
main entrance doors, you arrive at an entrance hall. To 
the left of this hall were the kitchen, staff dining hall, 
pantry, storeroom, service quarters, and a pharmacy. To 
the right were consultation offices, a second pharmacy, 
three bedrooms with bathrooms, laundry facilities, and 
a boiler room. Past the entry hall, visitors are confronted 
with a proto-modernist spatial expression: exiting 
northward, visitors step down onto a ceramic-paved 
path bounded by rainwater runners that asymmetrically 
bifurcate a garden courtyard (Figure 7). 
The courtyard seems to deploy incipient Modernist 
ideas on healing spaces proposed by the late eighteenthcentury German landscape scholar Christian Cay Lorenz: 
The garden should be directly connected to 
the hospital [… ]A view from the window into 
blooming and happy scenes will invigorate the 
patient […] [and] encourages patients to take 
a walk […] The plantings should wind along 
dry paths, which offer benches […]The spaces 
between could have beautiful lawns and colorful 
flower beds […] A hospital garden should have 
everything to enjoy nature and to promote a 
healthy life. (quoted in Marcus and Sachs 2014, 
7)
Lorenz’s texts, widely translated across Europe by 
the end of the eighteenth century, were especially 
influential in England and France (Parshall 1993, 125). 
Following Nightingale’s suggestion, the hospital’s 
internal courtyard was relatively open to the east, bound 
only by a low-height property wall that ensured fresh air 
first circulated through the campus’ courtyard and then 
through the buildings’ windows and into the wards. 
The low wall height enabled morning sunshine to bathe 
the south-facing windows of the main patient wards. 
To the courtyard’s west, possibly placed to block the 
setting sun, was the Matron’s residence. Its bedroom, 
living room, kitchen, and dining room arranged in a 
Figure 6. The Main Facade, facing south along Hospital Street, photograph by Author.

ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023

“shotgun” architectural typology. Here, visitors glimpse 
a more modern aesthetic: Originally, the residence’s 
east façade was an evenly plastered wall, interrupted by 
two darkly framed windows and framed by two white 
pilasters with simplified bases and Doric-like capitals 
painted to contrast starkly (Figure 8). Now operating as 
a museum, the Matron’s residence’s east windows have 
been protected from the sun with an awning, while the 
façade exhibits cobblestones. Directly to the east, an 
octagonal fountain aligns axially with the residence’s 
east windows. At the eastern end of the courtyard was 
an area reserved for keeping live animals used to feed 
patients, the cook’s apartment, and storage facilities.
Finally, the hospital’s main wing, located at the north 
end of the north-south axis, housed the operative 
medical facilities and the patient wards. The hospital 
wards exemplified a
standardized design popularized worldwide by 
Florence Nightingale—which promised to make 
hospital buildings into places of cure rather than 
incubators of disease. Pavilion-ward hospital 
buildings included hygienic materials and details, 
large open wards, support spaces, and little else.

Like the Matron’s residence, the courtyard-facing 
elevation has been transformed. Though today the 
façade is dominated by cobblestone, as Figure 9 shows, 
this façade initially matched the Matron’s residence 
vocabulary: its evenly plastered walls, darkly painted 
window frames, bright white pilasters, punctuated by 
darkly painted capitals and bases that sit on the base 
trim, produced a striking contrast with the administrative 
wing’s cobblestone and brick façade. Entry to the 
principal branch is vertically highlighted by a protruding 
double-story volume with a two-pitched roof. 
The entry, formed by an archway surrounding a recessed 
neo-classical frieze and columns, houses a vestibule that 
doubled as a chapel (see Figure 7). Behind the chapel 
was the on-duty nurses’ station, another of Nightingale’s 
contributions to hospital design. As part of the lessons 
learned in the Crimean War, she had outlined the need 
for a centralized nursing station, from where nurses 
could supervise the wards and rush to assist a patient 
when necessary. Behind the entry vestibule and at 
the center of the main wing were bathing facilities, 
the assistant nurses’ bedrooms, laundry, and pressing 
facilities. Real’s hospital layout was more the result 
of empirical observation and the consideration of 
processes than strict precedent. As Annmarie Adams 
observes, architects after 1900
bolstered their architectural authority not 
through their experience building related 
institutions, but rather through their direct 
observation of medical practice. […] It was their 
special knowledge of the routines, needs, and 
procedures of specific departments that enabled 
them to master the complex programmatic 
requirements of the modern hospital. (2008, 
108)
According to Dr. Hoskins, two large wards, one to each 
side of the entry vestibule, housed twelve beds each 
(six to a long side) but could, if needed, be fitted with 
double that amount for a total of forty-eight beds 
(Figure 10) (Hoskins 1909, 38-42). It is possible that 
the two wards were spread out symmetrically from 
the vestibule and nurses’ area to avoid “the corridor 
system, with double wards on each side, and so no cross 
ventilation,” a spatial practice bemoaned by Nightingale 
(McDonald 2020, 31). Then, following the latest design 
thinking, users walked through the wards through a 
central corridor informally bounded by the patients’ 
beds. Kisacky suggests this was because later hospital 
designs considered “the theory of transmission by direct 
contact could have provided the basis for an alternate 
architectural model of hospital design, one that focused 
on controlling the movement and condition of persons 
and objects” (2017, 107). The inward direction beds 
faced was an expression of maximized administrative 
control and maintenance:
The narrow width and long walls full of windows 
maximized natural architectural ventilation and 
left no dark corners where patients could hide 
illicit behaviors. Having the patients face into the 
ward put the patient’s head adjacent to the supply 
of fresh air but also facilitated nurse supervision, 
allowed direct physical access to the patient 
on both sides for examination or treatment, 
and prevented the patient’s exhalations and 
excretions from coating the adjacent walls. 
(Kisacky 2017, 65)
The floors were made of light-colored cedar or maple 
wood, which would permit the detection of filth 
and reflect light from the windows and when in use, 
electrical light fixtures. Past the east patient ward 
was an x-ray room equipped with state-of-the-art

instruments (Figure 11) and the pharmacists’ lab (Figure 
12). The available x-ray equipment when the hospital 
opened in 1907 presents one of the clearest examples of 
Modernism’s contradictions (Gómez and Rodríguez-Paz 
2018). Throughout late nineteenth century Modernism, 
social reformers pushed for social engineering to prevent 
crime associated with impoverished workers had 
prioritized medical innovation: science and technology 
had made x-rays a valuable tool in healthcare. Yet, Real’s 
x-ray equipment was one of only a handful of machines 
found in all of Mexico at that time. In an era where so 
many governments boasted about social reform, the 
equipment had been purchased by the private mining 
company, for a specialized industry hospital, on the 
outskirts of a town with 12,251 total inhabitants in 1900 
(Secretaría 1902, table I). What mattered then was the 
capacity to continue to mine and produce ore; in that 
context, an x-ray machine was a wise investment.
To the west of the entrance vestibule, users entered 
a ward commonly used for rehabilitation. Past this 
ward, at the end of the wing, was the surgery suite and 
sterilization room equipped with the latest medical 
technology and tools. Finally, the hospital’s interiors 
were also the epitome of modern: ‘all the buildings are

Background: CAH intends to improve access to healthcare, coordinate with experts and providers, and serve as the rural population’s healthcare hub. It is imperative to understand environmental qualities that impact the quality of care to develop effective policies and design guidelines for rural healthcare. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies have focused on user or organizational outcomes related to the physical environment of rural healthcare settings. Methods: This cross-sectional exploratory qualitative case study was conducted as part of the facility planning process for a CAH in rural North Carolina. Hospital staff participated in a survey exploring their satisfaction with the overall physical environment privacy, space allocation, and department adjacency. An open-ended question asked staff to elaborate on needed improvements and changes in their department. Results: Findings show low satisfaction levels for space allocations for emergency department, lab, surgery, and wound care. Safety and quality were the two emerging outcomes of the physical environment’s shortcomings. Two clusters emerged from the content analysis, representing facility needs (rightly sized spaces, functional needs, COVID-19 needs, and improved access) and ambient conditions (clutter, visibility, flooring quality, noise, privacy, cleanliness, aesthetics, and temperature).

healthcare access for a rural population with
healthcare access inequities. Living in rural areas
of the United States associates with inferior
health outcomes, with a 40% higher preventable
hospitalization rate and a 23% higher mortality
rate than urban residents (Johnston et al., 2019).
Established disparities, such as longer driving distance to a hospital (Billi et al., 2007; Cai et al.,
2019) or lack of access to healthcare specialists,
have resulted in different health outcomes
between rural and urban areas (Brundisini et al.,
2013; Johnston et al., 2019). To bridge this gap,
CAH intend to improve access to healthcare,
coordinate with experts and providers, and serve
as the hubs of healthcare for the rural population
(The Rural Health Information Hub, 2022).
It is essential to improve the understanding of
environmental qualities that impact the quality of
care for developing effective policies and design
guidelines for rural healthcare. Current evidence
suggests physical environment is one of the factors affecting rural healthcare patient experience,
staff recruitment, patient participation, patient
satisfaction, processes, and staff satisfaction (Cai
et al., 2017, 2019; Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, &
Valipoor, 2016). Nevertheless, a limited number
of studies have focused on user or organizational
outcomes related to the physical environment of
rural healthcare settings (Cai et al., 2017, 2019;
Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, & Valipoor, 2016).
These studies recommend investigating rural care
teams’ perceptions of the potential relationships
between environmental variables.
Cai et al. (2017) study showed that existing
facilities need to be improved in providing
high-quality patient care satisfaction and staff
work experience. In another study, Cai et al.
(2019) survey of rural residents suggested the
topmost important environmental quality as privacy, adequate chairs in exam rooms for families,
and practical tools for information sharing and
communication between patients, families, and
clinicians. The research also found a correlation
between design features for an open counter to
communicate with the receptionists and simultaneously supporting patient privacy. The authors
also emphasize the need for patient privacy
support in exam rooms to discuss insurance information and financial implications, as such topics
are a paramount concern for rural residents.
Haddox et al. (2018) performed a pilot qualitative study on the elderly population of a rural outpatient clinic. The study found that lack of privacy
or confidentiality at check-in, clutter, seating proximity to contagious patients in waiting rooms, and
inadequate natural lighting in the reception and
exam rooms were some of the perceived barriers
to patient participation that may cause missing
appointments. Pati et al. (2016a) conducted an
explorative qualitative study of administrators of
four rural hospitals. The findings indicated that
older facilities were inadequate or unattractive
workspaces, negatively affecting efficiency,
safety, clinician specialist recruitment, staff morale, and patient perception of their local hospital
patient experience. Small operating rooms (OR)
needed more flexible teamwork space and
imposed equipment installation issues that
impacted surgeon recruitment. Laboratory, pharmacy, imaging, or radiology departments also
reported challenges such as the inadequate size
of space, configurations with improper adjacencies, or in demand for additional storage size.
These conditions negatively impacted operational
efficiency and safe delivery of care.
The focus of this exploratory study was to
address the following research questions: What is
the staff’s perception of the current obstacles and
needs relevant to the CAH’s infrastructure, physical
environment attributes, or ambient conditions?
Furthermore, why is improving and overcoming
these obstacles and needs essential? The underlying
frameworkinthis studyisthatthe facility design and
qualities of CAHs impact participant or organizational outcomes. Additionally, the study adds to the
limited body of knowledge on the impact of a pandemic on rural healthcare facility design. Finally,
this study aims to contribute to the evidence-based
design literature and inform decision makers of
future CAH design policy, practice, and research.
Method
This cross-sectional exploratory qualitative case
study was conducted as part of the facility
Zamani et al. 307
planning process for a CAH in rural North Carolina. The hospital was open to the rural county in
1930 and included specialties such as cardiology,
family practice, urgent care, wound care, orthopedic surgery, women’s health, and emergency
department (ED). Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2
explain critical department: Departmental Gross
Square Foot (DGSF) and room Square Footages
(SFs). The main hospital had two levels for a total
of 85,000 SF. Outpatient clinic buildings comprise seven detached buildings scaled between
1754 and 4201 (SF). An additional nursing center
department, with approximately 22788 (SF), was
currently vacant and used for storage.
Procedures
The planning, architecture, and operational
assessment team combined semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observation assessment
methods to understand needs, goals, and environmental challenges across diverse departments.
The CAH’s Ethics Committee reviewed and
approved the study protocol. For this article, we
will primarily focus on the survey responses. We
collected data during November and October
2021 over 4 weeks. Initially, the survey was
printed in paper format and distributed by the
CAH coordinator. Later, the CAH used departmental email distribution lists to distribute the
online survey link created in Google Forms. It
was noted in the email and surveyed introductory
paragraph that participation is voluntary. The
study avoided coercion to participate by not offering payment incentives and no threat of harm if
they declined participation. We collected no identifying information from participants.
Instrument
An expert panel of planners, architects, and
researchers collaborated to create a short survey
to understand staff’s satisfaction with 13 items,
including overall physical environment, space
allocation, team communication, patient flow,
medication flow, privacy, provider flow, family–visitor flow, or departmental adjacency. We
could not perform a reliability test due to limited
access to participants. Respondents were asked to
rate the various items based on their perceived

satisfaction level using a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 ¼ extremely dissatisfied to
5 ¼ extremely satisfied. Demographic questions
included department type and role. The openended question asked to the participants is:
“What is working well in your current department? What would you change to make your
department work better?”
In addition to the surveys, 21 staff participated in 10 focus group sessions. The hospital
coordinator recruited staff through emails,
encompassing nurses, physicians, administrative, and leadership roles. The team explored
clinical and administrative staff experiences
regarding physical environment needs impacting processes and performances. Questions
focused on department goals, challenges, and
success factors. Similar to the open-ended questions in the survey, we also asked the staff about
the physical environment changes needed to
improve their care delivery. Handwritten notes
were taken during the focus group interviews,
capturing essential insights. This article focuses
primarily on reporting the responses relevant to
the physical environment concerns.
Participants
The CAH site was undergoing a 3-year master
facility planning; thus, the study was based on a
convenience sample. The entire CAH staff was
the population of interest, including managers,
clinicians, and nonclinicians (n ¼ 207). There
were no exclusion or inclusion criteria.
Seventy-four individuals completed the online
or paper survey with an overall 36% response
rate. Tables 2 and 3 display participants’ departments and roles. Due to limited direct access to
participants, we conducted no further analysis to
determine the characteristics of staff who did not
respond.
Data Preparation and Analysis
Qualitative data preparation and analysis of
open-ended responses were performed in MS
Excel. The Google Form and paper-based
responses were organized and merged into an
MS Excel document. Descriptive statistics were
analyzed using the JASP Version 0.16.4.0 software for the Likert-type scale-based questions.
The internal expertise team reviewed all codes

department, medical office buildings, and a vacant nursing center. Source: Image Copyright: Author.

to ensure data validity and interpretation. The
goal was to understand the staff’s level of satisfaction with the overall physical environment,
space allocation, department adjacency, and privacy. The second phase included looking at
departments with lower satisfaction ratings for
these physical environment ratings. Initially, all
transcripts were coded based on their contents
with particular attention to subthemes suggested
by Pati et al. (2016a): (a) any direct reference to
the facility needs or physical environment qualities of the CAH, including the buildings,
departments, and workspaces, and (b) any outcomes associated with the physical design such
as staff or patient experiences, care quality,
operations, or safety. Next, we clustered the
subthemes into key themes aligning with the
content analysis performed by Cai et al.
(2019) and Pati et al. (2016a).
Results
Satisfaction Ratings
Table 3 displays the descriptive statistics for the
overall CAH and staff’s average satisfaction per
department (Table 4). The findings suggest low
satisfaction levels for ED, lab, surgery, and
wound-care space allocations. Wound-care staff
was also comparatively dissatisfied with department adjacency and the overall environment
compared to other departments. The surgical staff
was the least satisfied with the privacy attributes
of their department. Due to low participation

qualitative and not generalizable.
Open-Ended Findings
Two clusters emerged from the content analysis,
representing facility needs (rightly sized spaces,
functional needs, COVID-19 needs, and
improved access) and physical environment conditions (clutter, visibility, flooring quality, noise,
privacy, cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and temperature; Table 5 and 6). Safety and quality were
the two emerging outcomes of the physical environment’s shortcomings: safety concerns to infection control compliance and patient, equipment,
and staff safety; quality pertained to patient flow,
staff flow, staff performance, patient–visitor

Facility needs. Facility needs were the most mentioned themes in the open-ended responses.
Emerging subthemes included the need for adequately sized spaces, functional needs, COVID19 needs, and access improvements that will be
reviewed in the subsequent paragraphs.
Rightly sized spaces. The first subtheme focuses
on the inadequate space sizes in outdated buildings. These included desiring larger departments,
workstations, exam rooms, bathrooms, offices,
meeting spaces, waiting rooms, equipment
rooms, break rooms, or training rooms. Administrative staff reflected the need for larger meeting
spaces for staff, office spaces, and rounding
rooms. Lab department staff requested more
extensive patient waiting, storage, drawing area,
testing space, equipment room, or intravenous
(IV) rooms to improve patient experience and
flow. The ED staff mentioned needing larger
patient rooms to accommodate computers, equipment rooms, storage space, and adequately sized
nurse stations to improve patient flow. Universal
and flexible rooms that were identical to monitoring capabilities were desired. The surgical team
perceived the space needed to be more responsive
to departmental growth. They emphasized the
need for larger storage spaces, nurse stations,
ORs, patient bays, and central sterile spaces corresponding to the patient volume. The insufficient
equipment storage space affected equipment
safety outcomes, as one of the staff explained:
Table 7. Example of Quotes Relevant to Safety and Quality Outcomes.
Themes Subthemes Example of Quote
Safety Infection control New flooring that is waterproof and does not have gaps for blood and
tissue to be trapped-Infection control (Woundcare Center)
Patient safety There is room for improvement to increase emergency response efficiency
and employee or patient safety with changes to the exterior public and
private entrances, an exterior reconfiguration of the ED Ambulance
Entrance, or even a total relocation of the ED (emergency
department [ED])
Equipment safety The facility invests in state-of-the-art equipment, and there is nowhere to
put it and care for it. It gets moved around and bumped (Surgery)
Staff safety I liked the wall in registration terms of safety, but now it is open. If you put
glass instead of a wall, that would be great (Registration).
Quality Patient flow We’ve outgrown the space here in peri-operative. As it stands now, it
would be difficult to hold more than one total joint patient until they are
ready and cleared for discharge (Surgery)
Staff flow and performance Our bays are extremely small. It makes it difficult to accommodate visitors,
perform nerve blocks, or attend to a patient if an additional provider is
also in the bay. The bays are very close, with only a curtain between
them. There is no privacy whatsoever (Surgery)
Patient–visitor experience

We have limited staff education space and meeting spaces (Admin)
Comfort The rounding room is too small, and the upstairs conference room is too
crowded, with many different items and folks competing for space
(Admin)
Reduced cost We have outgrown the operating room (OR) and need more storage.
Some of our equipment is stored in the old nursing center, and if it is
needed during surgery, we have to wait for someone to get the
equipment and wait for them to return. This is costing time and money
due to no storage (Surgery)
Zamani et al. 313
We are outgrowing our space in the OR. We need
more room to store our equipment. The facility
invests in state-of-the-art equipment, and there is
nowhere to put it and care for it. It gets moved
around and bumped.
The small patient bays affected staff performance, visitor experience, and communication
outcomes. One staff member commented on
how the small bays affect their operations:
“Our bays are tiny. It makes it difficult to
accommodate visitors, perform nerve blocks,
or attend to a patient if there is an additional
provider in the bay.”
Staff emphasized the need for a more extensive Sterile Processing Department (SPD) to
accommodate more washers, storage, and desk
space to support the number of sterilized trays
and OR procedures. The inadequate space
resulted in stacking trays on each other, which
resulted in the risk of case delays, contamination,
and subsequent patient infection. Further, the
poorly stacked trays created safety concerns for
staff as they needed to bed down to pick heavy
trays from shelves (Figure 3).
Functional needs. Functional needs were captured by mentioning additional spaces or
revised adjacencies varying by the department.
Administrative staff reflected the need for
more meeting or conference spaces, additional
classrooms, workspace, or rounding rooms with
integrated technology for virtual meetings.
Another administrative staff mentioned the
need for private office rooms to “be more
cohesive to accomplish more work.”
The clinical staff communicated the concern
about the lack of storage in the ED, resulting in
cluttered hallways and a “jammed” nurse station
that imposed a safety hazard. ED staff requested
additional bathrooms, equipment rooms, safe
rooms, and exterior decontamination storage.
One of the ED staff elaborated on the possible
reuse of the nursing home currently used as storage for the ED spatial needs (Figure 4). One of the
staff elaborated:
[the closed nursing home facility] area would give
the Emergency Room (ER) the Space it needs, storage, extra bathrooms, and privacy adjacent to our
helicopter flight area. Saving the patient at least 10
minutes of critical time.
The clinical staff communicated the
concern about the lack of storage in the
ED, resulting in cluttered hallways and a
“jammed” nurse station that imposed a
safety hazard.
Staff from the imaging department thought the
adjacency to ED was optimal. They reflected the
need for an additional shower and changing
rooms for the entire facility. Laboratory staff
reflected the need for staff break rooms and lockers, American Disability Act (ADA)–compliant
toilets, and storage. One staff noted that departmental adjacencies were substantial for efficient
flow, cost, and patient satisfaction: “We need
more space. And not chopped-up space; you must
walk across the hall to use additional space. We
need space that is all together.”
“We need more space. And not choppedup space; you must walk across the hall to
use additional space. We need space that

The pharmacy department requested additional patient toilet rooms and a satellite pharmacy. Outpatient clinic staff thought the
separate clinic buildings with three to four exams
per building were not optimal, as one described:

requirements. With this inefficient adjacency,
there was a need for reserved parking and a risk
of patient falls. This situation also impacted
patient safety and satisfaction outcomes as
patients needed to gown and drive to the chamber.
Surgical staff explained the need for additional
equipment storage, workspaces, bathrooms, and
walled patient bays. An inadequate number of
post anesthesia care unit (PACU) bays resulted
in an urge to discharge patients to maintain flow
from the OR to patient bays, which affected the
patient experience of feeling “rushed to be discharged.” Staff perceived the need for bays with
doors to protect patient privacy and satisfy storage needs in bays. Surgical staff described that
inappropriately located equipment storage affects
efficiency and cost outcomes.

COVID-19 needs. Smaller departments, such as
lab, cardiac rehab, or ED, were more concerned
about spatial limitations that restricted the
COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. The ED
registration staff complained about the waiting
area congestion and its impact on visibility and
safety during the pandemic. The staff noted that
moving sick patients to another section with
removable dividable walls during the pandemic
was safer. However, these walls impeded visibility for the ER registration staff. Therefore, the
ED registration staff recommended including
glass walls to support visibility and patient
separation (Figure 5). With the ease of pandemic
limitations, the CAH removed the walls with only
one glass wall remaining, resulting in the current
open waiting room that decreased the perception
of safety for staff.
The pandemic highlighted the need for revisiting the ambulance entrance to the ED as it presented spatial challenges to accommodate
officials for mass casualty and contaminated
patient incidents. Further, staff elaborated on the
need for climate-controlled storage for decontamination equipment adjacent to the ED. Decontamination equipment stored in a distant location
from the ED entrance and exterior space could
have been more efficient spatial adjacency.
Most outpatient clinic patients had complex
chronic conditions; some traveled up to 20 miles
to access primary care services. Clinicians recommended expanding telehealth services for wellness visits due to Medicare reimbursement. The
current use of telehealth for provider visits was
10%. In the current state, preregistration occurs
through text messages, patients wait in the car and

guidelines for infectious patient divisions. Other wall divisions that impeded visibility had been removed. Source:

alert their arrivals, and nurses screen patients in
the cars and direct them from back doors if
suspected to be infectious by COVID-19. However, older patients struggled with telehealth
and preferred meeting the provider in person
or over the phone.

inadequate spaces resulted in many noncompliant ADA toilet rooms. To improve patient
access, staff recommend extending the operating hours for some departments, including physical therapy. Staff also mentioned necessary
exterior upgrades to improve patient accessibility, especially for older patients: “For patients
with walkers, walking across sand or accessibility with a ramp is difficult; we need to improve
the patient experience.”
Smaller scale clinics were a positive attribute
for patient experience outcomes as they reduced
walking distances for older patients. Adjacency
and access to or within departments were also
crucial for staff. For example, lab staff explained
the need for a more cohesive department to
reduce walking distances and improve staff performance. Adding automatic doors for ED was
also a recommendation to improve visitor access
and staff efficiency to eliminate the need for
staff to open doors.
Physical environment attributes and ambient
condition. Staff elaborated on improving physical
environment attributes and ambient conditions by
reducing clutter, improving visibility, flooring
material quality, cleanliness, aesthetic condition,
temperature comfort, and privacy attributes discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.
Reduce clutter. Restricted space in specific
departments such as ED or surgery resulted in
a need for more storage spaces for equipment,
carts, or beds cluttered ambiance (Figure 6).
Staff believed that reducing the clutter improves
efficiency, safety, and costs. Staff commented on
the need for additional equipment storage to
improve flow and reduce hallway clutter for
operational efficiency outcomes. One of the
ED nurses described how the nursing station
gets cluttered with personnel and carts. This
condition reduced the clinician’s satisfaction,
as one described: “We feel like we are sardines
in our nurse’s station.” State-of-the-art equipment stored in the hallways surgical department was bumped and moved around, which
harmed equipment quality. The surgical services staff emphasized the importance of
reducing OR clutter to improve operations and
movements.
Visibility. Visibility was an important attribute,
especially for the ED department. Staff noted that
the nurse station size and form affected visibility
toward psychiatric patients. The registration staff
noted that the wide registration area with inadequate security staff in the evenings is a security
concern. The lab department staff considered the
open workstation design a positive attribute,
improving visibility and communication among
staff and managers.
Flooring quality. The bedded care staff noted the
need to replace the corridor carpet in a few
years, when obsolete, with a hard surface—luxury vinyl tile to improve infection control outcomes (Figure 7). Staff recommended flooring
quality improvements that included removing
stains and cracks, improving exterior flooring
quality, and installing waterproof material without
gaps. Such improvements needed the dismissal of
short-term costs to satisfy infection control guidelines and patient safety.
Improve cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and
temperature. The hospital needed updating,
cleaning, and modernization to improve staff
recruitment, visitor perception, safety, and conformance to the current healthcare architectural
style. Staff found that departments were
“antiquated” and reflected the need to remodel
and replace dark floorings and walls (Figure 8).
For example, a staff described: “the hospital
should not look old. We need to improve the
flooring and waiting rooms and facelift things.
Landscaping needs attention: the parking lot
needs to be kept up, and visual needs to improve.”

The hospital’s physical environment attributes
and ambient conditions influenced staff recruitment and retention. One of the outpatient clinic
staff mentioned:

to be kept up, and visual needs to improve.

One comment on needing a better air conditioning system in the cardiopulmonary department influenced staff comfort levels.
Reduce noise and improve privacy. Smaller
departments and insufficient workspaces resulted
in a perception of a noisy environment impeding
performance, especially for ED and surgical staff.
Privacy concerns for patients and staff were vital
for physician dictation rooms, phone call rooms,
triage rooms, check-in areas, registration, and
patient bays. Several clinicians mentioned adding
doors to the bays or private patient rooms in the
ED to improve patient privacy (Figure 9). The ED
and surgical staff reflected that the curtain
between beds was insufficient for patient privacy.
Patient privacy was also essential for registrationcheck-in staff, as one staff noted: “we need something better for patient privacy instead shouting
information out to everyone.”"

The objectives of this study are to explore the role of the built environment on staff’s work satisfaction, geriatric psychiatric patients’ wellbeing, and assess the importance of treating mental and physical illness of older adults in the same clinical setting. Data were obtained from behavior observation/mapping of existing spaces and interviews with staff and patients. Interview data were analyzed, coded, and juxtaposed with themes from behavior observation/mapping.

the United States will rise from 46.2 million to 80.8 million by 2040.
Approximately 15% of adults ages 50 and older experience mental health illness (National Institute of Mental Health, 2020). The healthcare industry is
rapidly changing to meet the needs of this growing aging population and
achieve the fundamental patient-centered goals of healthcare. To that point,
there has been growing research focusing on the relationship between the built
environment and staff’s work satisfaction and patients’ wellbeing (Dijkstra
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2019). The human relationship with the built and
natural environment is extensively discussed by architects and designers

These fields offer a unique perspective with an empirical and theoretical
understanding of healthcare settings. However, there remains a significant gap
in knowledge pertaining to the architecture of psychiatric geriatric care (PGC)
centers and its impact on staff and patients. This study evaluates the impact
of the built environment on staff’s work satisfaction and geriatric psychiatric
patients’ health and wellbeing. It also assesses the importance of treating mental and physical illness of older adults in the same clinical setting.
Psychiatric hospitals are being transformed to positively impact patients’
experience, wellbeing, and recovery (Chrysikou, 2019). Older adults with psychiatric problems tend to have more physical health issues than those without
mental health illnesses (Daumit et al., 2002; Prior et al., 1996). The impact of
aging complicates the diagnosis and treatment of mental health, and therefore
increases their time spent in a hospital bed (Harrell, 2002). Thus, there is a
higher risk of morbidity and mortality for psychiatric patients with physical
illness (Sprah et al., 2017). However, transferring patients between psychiatric
care and medical hospital settings can result in challenges when care is not
provided in the same location. Examples of medical challenges that can be
avoided by providing mental and physical care services in the same hospital
include a reduction in: (a) the prevalence of prescribing omissions from 64.7%
to 11.2% and (b) inappropriate prescription of medicines from 77.3% to
18.6% (Lang et al., 2012). The prevalence of chronic health conditions in older
adults with mental illness and the challenges in providing care present an
immediate need for research to guide the design of integrated mental and
physical health care for older adults, to ameliorate the long-lasting impact of
mental and physical illness (Jones et al., 2004).
Until recently, the design of most care environments for older adults has
been based on previous models or information from care staff and architects without input from the older adults themselves (Norouzi et al., 2019;
O’Malley et al., 2017). This article presents findings from a study assessing
the environmental requirements of a PGC unit by analyzing existing geropsychiatric hospitals and directly interviewing staff and older adult patients
about their needs regarding the built environment to ensure their preference will be considered in the future design of these centers. These finding
were then incorporated into creating a hypothetical design model of a PGC
center to be used as an example by other hospital owners and designers.
Materials and methods
Study setting
Three psychiatric hospitals, Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C, with
similar settings and designated geriatric wings, participated in this study.
2 N. NOROUZI
The original design of each hospital campus included multiple wings, one of
which was dedicated to geriatric patients. For the purposes of this study,
geriatric patients are those who are either over 65 years old or younger but
have major neurological impairments, making it difficult for them to care for
themselves (defined by a geriatric psychiatrist interviewed for this study). Site
selection was based on hospital typology, status as a state facility, and
approval from the hospital’s superintendent or institutional review board.
Ethical approval
Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of
the first author’s university. Authorization to conduct the study was obtained
in each PGC center. Each participant signed a written consent form after
being informed of the description and objectives of the study, the voluntary
nature of participation, the ability to withdraw at any time, and the audio
recording of the interviews. Participation in the study was confidential, and
required measures were implemented to ensure data protection.
Data collection
Data were collected through two sources of behavioral observation/mapping
and interviews.
Behavior observation/mapping
Observation is an ideal way to study nonverbal human behavior, expressions, postures, and the physical environment of a space (Lipson-Smith &
McLaughlan, 2022). Behavior observation/mapping is an objective method
of noting actions, attitudes, and social interactions within the built environment. It provides data related to characteristics of the environment, including type, time, place, and the people involved in each activity. The research
team used place-centered mapping to observe and record different activities
and interactions that took place in the “community living room” of each
geriatric unit. Each hospital had just one community living room per unit.
The square footage of the community living rooms for all hospitals was
similar. However, the common space in Hospital C was adjacent to a
secure outdoor balcony.
Observations were recorded by sketching people in each space and marking different activities on the architectural plan of that space (e.g.,
Figure 1). Observation method of different behaviors was based on different type and level of interactions. Each observation session was conducted
by two researchers and lasted for three hours. Table 1 presents definitions
for different behaviors that were observed and recorded.
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 3
Interviews
Interview questions were developed using the research team’s initial analysis of 60 articles related to mental healthcare. The issues that emerged
from the literature analysis led to questions focused on the use of the
building including an onsite medical care unit, the impact of the built
environment on staff’s safety and comfort, and patients’ wellbeing and
recovery. Interview questions were not pilot tested or provided to interviewees prior to the interview. Interviews were semi-structured and
recorded for verbatim transcriptions.
Interviewee recruitment consisted of emailing hospital superintendents
and asking for participation. After the initial agreement, the superintendent
sent a general email to all employees inviting them to participate in the
study. The email body included the first names and affiliations of the
research team members, a female assistant professor as the first author and
a male graduate student, and their objectives for the study. The email also
stated that the interviewees’ responses will be used in presentations and
publications to inform design decisions for future PGC centers. The
research team connected with interviewees and built rapport by spending
time in each hospital, observing, and talking to employees and patients one
day prior to starting the interview process. Employees who were interested
in participating in the study expressed their willingness by responding to
the email. Staff interviews lasted between 45 and 60 min. Patient interviewees were recruited through the director of patients’ rights within each hospital. The only patients who participated were the ones who were able to
provide consent and comprehend the interview process and questions. All
patient interviews were conducted in the presence of a staff member familiar with that patient to ensure the safety and comfort of both the patient

and the interviewer. Each interview lasted between 15 and 20 min. All
patients interviewed for this study were aged 65 or older and none of the
participants dropped out.
Although difficult to determine a specific number for sample size in
grounded theory studies, 10–60 is a typical number of participants reported
(Starks & Trinidad, 2007). The research team of this study continued interviewing participants until they agreed on both code and meaning saturation
(Aldiabat & Le Navenec, 2018). The interviewers discussed the responses
after every 10 interviews were conducted. These discussions were brief and
mostly focused on whether the team was collecting and learning new information. Though some information were repetitive among patient responses,
there was enough differences to convince the interviewers to continue until
they “heard it all” and fully understood all the issues raised by the interviewees (Hennink et al., 2017). The interviewees included 15 patients and
29 doctors, nurses, and therapists. Additional participants, unique to each
hospital, included peer support personnel (2), patients’ rights staff (2),
environmental services staff (1), dietitians (2), geriatric mental health service providers (3), activity coordinator (1), and administrators (4). The
research team was not informed of anyone refusing to participate in the
study and none dropped out after the initial agreement.
Data analysis
This research uses a constructivist grounded theory methodology.
Constructivist grounded theory responds to questions of how, when, and to
what extent the study is involved with other positions, networks, and situations (Charmaz, 2008), as well as how, when, and to what extent the study,
both data collection and analysis, is influenced by the relationships and
experiences of participants and the point of views, perspectives, positions,
and interactions of the researcher (Charmaz, 2014). In this study, some of
the participants from Hospital A and C had spent time in other psychiatric
hospitals, which led to a specific perception and position on how the built
environment could be designed to enhance the quality of life for older
adults. An example of these environmental features was an onsite medical
unit. Constructivist grounded theory is used in this study to develop an
explanatory theory of the influence of the built environment on staff and
patients as well as the necessity of an onsite medical unit within a PGC.
Although constructivist grounded theory is not traditionally used for creating design models, it is useful in architectural research as it generates a
new substantive concept (Lianto, 2019) and has been used to propose
architectural design process (Norouzi et al., 2019).
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 5
Behavior observation/mapping analysis
Through side-by-side comparison and assessment of the detailed sketches
of patients’ daily activities with the notes taken of the same event, the
research team coded the placement of architectural features, layout of furniture, location of patients in relation to one another, types of activities
taking place, and length of time for each activity.
Interview analysis
Members of the research team individually read, re-read, and conducted
line-by-line and focused coding of the transcriptions while examining the
data for ideas, thoughts, feelings, issues, and challenges mentioned by the
interviewees (Charmaz, 2008). For example, one of the patients said, “It
doesn’t matter if I have my own bedroom, but I want my own locked
drawer and a TV.” One member of the research team coded this line as
ownership and another coded it as patient preference. During the focused
coding this was discussed and agreed to be coded as patient needs and then
categorized under autonomy. These preliminary codes were analyzed and
grouped based on meaning similarities. For example, access to family visitation rooms, multi-religion/spiritual place, and shared dining room were
coded as connection and single patient bedrooms and bathrooms were
coded as privacy. The identified subcategories of connection and privacy
were then placed under autonomy as a major category.
Categories and subcategories were organized to reflect the users’ perception of how the design of the hospital influenced their daily activities
(Tolley et al., 2016). This process verified some of the categories found in
the literature but also permitted the emergence of new categories. All categories were then juxtaposed with the notes and sketches from behavior
observation/mapping and reanalyzed through triangulation of various data
sources, multiple discussion, and integration of memos (Glaser, 1978) to
develop theoretical coding. For example, the behavior mapping illustrated
that many patients were watching television while a doctor was having a
private conversation with a patient in the same space. While patient interviewees did not mind conversing with doctors in public spaces, the staff
requested multiple therapy spaces of different sizes. The juxtaposition of
these findings resulted in the recommendation of adding smaller common
spaces and multiple therapy rooms for each unit. Another example that
emerged from literature analysis, patients’ descriptions of other hospitals,
and eager response of interviewees was the need for an onsite medical unit
that serves patients’ physical needs. Although, the research team did not
have any behavior/observation mapping data on this topic, the number of
interviewees requests and inquires for an onsite medical unit was precise
and clearly justified by both patients and staff. Example of these responses
6 N. NOROUZI
include “psychiatric hospitals vary widely in their ability to take care of
patients’ medical needs and it is difficult to decide where to admit a patient
with both medical and psychiatric illnesses, so many of these patients usually take longer to heal [ … ] This is even worse for older adults because
they are probably more fragile” said a psychologist from Hospital A, and
“we need to make sure the older patients are physically healthy and able to
participate in therapeutic interventions for their mental health, so we examine them often. But if they get sick, we send them to a different hospital to
be treated. This means either their mental or physical health needs to be
on hold at any given time” said a nurse from Hospital C. The research
team triangulated interviewees’ responses with the literature analysis findings and created the subcategory of medical care unit under the category of
safety. During this stage, the research team compared notes and sketches
from behavioral mapping with interviewees’ description of a space or
expectation of a place to acquire a comprehensive understanding of user’s
needs that led to the development of theoretical coding. The research team
discussed all the final codes, categories, and subcategories to reach 100%
agreement that led to theoretical coding.
Results and discussion
Theoretical coding
The results of this study reveal a relationship between the architectural
design of a PGC center and the wellbeing of geropsychiatric patients and
the safety of staff as well as the need for a medical care unit at a PGC center. The assessment of the behavior observation/mapping notes and
sketches resulted in specific spatial qualities that could positively contribute
to or hinder staff and patients’ behavior, especially when juxtaposing with
the results of staff and patient interviews. Below is the discussion of how
the findings of this study contributed to the theoretical code and incorporated in the architectural design model. Table 2 presents an example of the
existing architectural qualities of common spaces in each hospital and how
these features affected different types of interactions.
The behavior observation/mapping of the common space in Hospital A
reveals activity limitations for patients and an unsafe and uncomfortable
setting for staff. The architectural qualities of this space, presented in
Table 2, prevent any interactive peer interactions and present the need for
private nooks within the public spaces, similar to what Wang and
Brockmole titled “nested environments” (2003). The results of the patients’
interviews confirm their need for privacy both within the framework of
their private rooms and in the common spaces.
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 7
The common space of Hospital B is near the open nurse station, which is a
prime location for patient interaction with staff and other patients (Jovanovic
et al., 2019). Although patients preferred the common space near the nurse station, their interview responses emphasize their desire for control and privacy.
Examples of these statements are: “I like being around other people but not
always with them” and “I like to make friends and do different things, […]
because everyone is different and sometimes we like to be alone in our room,
sometimes with a lot of people.” This verified the need for private spaces within
each public space.
The common space of Hospital C is adjacent to an outdoor balcony and
offers a great combination of an indoor-outdoor connection that could
potentially provide opportunities for different types of interaction.
However, this space was too small for any type of gathering and the behaviors observed by the research team were only solitary, wandering, or parallel peer where patients were walking around aimlessly or sitting close to
one another but not interacting with each-other. This led to the decision of
creating large common spaces that are modifiable and allow for change in
the use of space when needed.
The result of the staff interviews presented the immediate need for physical and psychological safety of the staff, and their comfort. Interviewees’
requests included centrally located nursing stations, multiple entry therapy
rooms, and private spaces to work, exercise, and rest. Table 3 presents the
properties and subcategories of the categories identified by the staff.
Table 2. Examples of behaviors in common spaces of different hospitals.
Hospital Behavior Space Qualities of space
A S, PP, IS, W Common space Lobby area surrounded by main building entrance on
the south, offices on north and west and the unit’s
enclosed nurse station on the north—in addition
to being used as a corridor, the space is used as a
TV room by patients. It is too small for the
number of patients, especially if they are
interested in different types of activities during
their free time, with minimum natural light and
almost no view of the outside.
B IP, IS, W, S, PP Common Space Living room placed in the center of the four patients
wings and next to an open nurse station, including
small sitting areas but no large tables—this
allowed patients to stand around the nurse’s desk,
interact with staff and their peers.
C S, W, PP Common Space with
Outdoor Balcony
A well-lit space with multiple seating arrangements
for two or three people to sit at each setting. This
space was adjacent to a kitchenette that led to a
fenced outdoor balcony—these three spaces gave
patients choices but not enough options for
interaction and, as a result, most patients were
wandering or seating individually.

Centrally located nursing stations can serve as a landmark in geriatric
patients’ wayfinding (O’Malley et al., 2022), and open nursing stations connect patients and staff and provide a sense of freedom (Southard et al.,
2012). The nurses interviewed for this study expressed mixed feelings about
open nursing stations, as these limit confidentiality and concentrated workspace. The chief nurse at Hospital A said, “You can never get everyone to
agree but the bottom line is that staff need to feel safe and have space to
do their job without compromising patient information.” Multiple staff
members emphasized the fact that some patients stay in the hospital for
longer periods of time, and it is therefore important to offer them a
“home-like” environment. A registered Nurse from Hospital B said “We
call the open space adjacent to the nurse station the living room, so it
needs to feel like a home with family members who trust each-other. If we
sit behind a glass wall and close ourselves to patients, we are telling them
that they are not trustworthy.” The interviewees acknowledged that open
nurse stations offer opportunities for more positive socializing and
exchange as well as direct verbal communication between staff and patients.
This leads to a decrease in aggression toward staff (Southard et al., 2012)
and significantly reduces the patients’ number of seclusion episodes
(Oostermeijer et al., 2021).
Therapy rooms with multiple entrances offer the staff opportunities of
escape when needed. In describing how a staff member might get stuck

with an agitated patient, a psychologist interviewed for this study said,
“Patients go into a therapy room, and for the staff to get in there they
must leave the hallway and then kind of go at an angle, away from everyone else. If the patient decides to block the door and harm the staff, there
is no place for them to go. The staff is trapped back there. If the room has
two doors, the staff can use the second door to leave. Others could also
enter to help.” A music therapist described the benefit of multiple entrances for patients and said, “Some patients wander and with double doors,
they can go in one door and out the other. I see this happen often during
group therapy sessions. The patient wants to stay in the session but doesn’t
have the patience.”
Private spaces were recognized by the staff as areas separated from
patients. One of the nurses said, “It is hard to complete charts and focus
on patient’s recovery plan in an office that patients can access. Even with
the door closed, someone will bang on the door; we need a private workroom.” A performance program supervisor talked about the importance of
staff safety and rejuvenation and said that “it is critical to have a comfort
room for staff.” One of the nurses who worked as a Personal Need
Allowance (PNA) said, “It will be great to have a space for staff that experience trauma or a stressful situation so they can go there and breathe, meditate, and relax before getting back to work.” Staff interviewees also talked
about the benefit of a having a gym on campus. A director of environmental services at Hospital C talked about the outdoor walking trails for
patients and added, “But staff can’t really walk there without being
approached by patients. It will be nice to have a place with equipment for
exercise and showers.”
Staff interviewees often talked about patients’ physical and psychological
needs. A psychologist said, “We have four patients in each room but even
though the rooms are spacious, there is absolutely not enough space for
four people who might be mad at each-other. The best-case scenario is to
have at least 50% of the bedrooms be private and the others be double for
patients who prefer to have a roommate.”
Patients interviewed for this study talked about their urgent need for
spaces that offer privacy while providing opportunities to connect, places to
rest and heal, and areas of exploration and discovery, such as sensory
rooms. One of the patients said, “I was in a different hospital before and
we had a gym, a print shop there. I was the supervisor and helped other
patients print shirts for their family. It was nice to have something to do.”
Another patient talked about the difficulty of meeting her family on campus due to the shortage of private visiting rooms. Table 4 presents the
properties and subcategories of the four categories that emerged from
patients’ data.

Medical unit in PGC center
The hospitals included in this study did not have a medical care unit.
However, the results of the literature analysis and the data collected from
the interviews conducted for this study presented an imperative need for a
medical care unit connected to the PGC center. Some patient interviewees
talked about their physical health needs and the inconvenience of having to
travel to a medical care facility outside of the hospital to receive care. Staff
members described the challenges in responding to patients’ medical needs
and enthusiastically requested an onsite medical care unit. The geriatric
psychologist said, “The geriatric unit is generally slower and calmer. But
one main issue is the patients’ medical needs. So, we really need to have a
space with hospital beds and equipment to take care of those patients without sending them outside of the state hospital and delaying the mental

care.” A medical director said, “We don’t always get the patient’s medical
history when they arrive here and many have existing illnesses that need to
be cared for, [ … ] I understand the ligature [attachment points for ties that
could cause bodily harm] risk, but the geriatric patients need medical care,
and we need to find a way to do it here.” One patient expressed discomfort
about having to leave the hospital once a month to get checked for an
existing medical condition and another patient said, “It’s hard for me to
sleep so I take medicine and try to adjust my bed to help me. I need to
have my oxygen level adjusted but for that I have to go to another hospital
and that’s really hard.” The superintendent talked about the difficulty of
communication and information transfer between medical and psychiatric
hospitals when patients must leave and return. Multiple therapists disclosed
their concern about the gap in patients’ psychiatric treatments while they
are in the medical hospital.
Design model for PGC center
The findings of this study resulted in creating a replicable design model
and architectural base for future PGC centers. The essential discoveries that
informed this model include providing visibility, accessibility, and rejuvenation for staff while respecting patients’ autonomy, atmosphere, boundary,
and safety.
This model was developed in three phases. The first version was created
by two architecture students under the supervision of the principal investigator. This version of the model included a central public space that connected two psychiatric wings and nursing stations. This model was
presented to a team of experts including architects, nurses, doctors, and
patients’ caregivers. The main concern voiced about this version of the
model was the lack of funding for two nurse stations. The design team
then revised the model and presented a second version with one central
nurse station connecting two psychiatric wings to the team of experts. The
second presentation and multiple discussions between the author and the
expert team led to the latest version of this model (Figure 2) illustrated
below. This version was developed by the author and approved by the
expert team.
The design model incorporates the theoretical code developed in this
study and includes a central nurse station that offers staff maximum visibility and unobtrusive surveil of entire unit while providing a safe space to
plan activities and coordinate with other staff. Accessibility is safely provided through (a) multiple entrances and exits in each therapy room so
that staff can keep the patients in the room if necessary, while also offering
them the opportunity to leave and return (Simonsen & Duff, 2020), b)

adequate lighting in all areas, (c) central spaces for staff to meet with
patients and receive quick help if necessary, and (d) use of anti-ligature
material and furniture. This model responds to the staff’s need for rejuvenation by dedicating a section of the building to staff members. This section
includes private offices, indoor/outdoor breakrooms, multiple restrooms, a
workout area, a medication room, and an open nurse station with a clear
line of sight to all wings. The offices are in the back and away from
patients so the staff can work privately.
This model respects patients’ autonomy by offering a sense of privacy
and dignity through single bedrooms with private bathrooms (Ulrich et al.,
2018), access to semi-private outdoor courtyards, and semi-private seating
areas within indoor common spaces, private visitation rooms for patients
and their families (Jovanovic et al., 2019), multiple private meeting rooms
for private conversations between doctors and patients and their families
(Jenkins et al., 2015), and a series of waist-high walls throughout the unit
to promote mini conversations and to construct nested environments
where a patient can be alone in public (Christenfeld et al., 1989).
This model provides smaller public spaces for each wing while maintaining
the large central public space as a community living room. The small public
spaces with abundant natural light also offer patients opportunities for positive social engagement (Ulrich et al., 2008) or to quickly separate themselves
from problematic situations that might be happening in a hallway (Espinosa
et al., 2015). These additional choices of different places to be and activities
to engage in can help prevent boredom, increases meaningful communication
with peers and staff, and reduces social isolation, all of which are common
challenges for geropsychiatric hospitals (Jovanovic et al., 2019).
This model also offers a medical care unit connected to one of the geropsychiatric wings. This wing is divided into two sections via double doors;
the first section closest to the nurse station includes eight private patient
rooms for geropsychiatric care and the second section includes six private
rooms with hospital beds and the equipment needed to take care of
patients’ medical needs. This section can be closed off and separated in
case of an infectious disease outbreak and the need for quarantining several patients"

Background: Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are among the young population with the highest percentage of mental illness. However, there are limited number of intentionally designed psychiatric hospitals for adolescents. Staff who work in adolescent psychiatric hospitals may face workplace violence. Studies on environmental impacts suggest that the built environment affects patients’ well-being and safety as well as staff’s satisfaction, working condition, safety, and health. However, there are very few studies that focus on adolescent psychiatric hospitals and the impact of the built environment on both staff and patients. Methods: Data were collected through literature analysis and semi-structured interviews with staff of three psychiatric state hospitals with adolescent patient units. The triangulation of multiple data sources informed a set of environmental design conditions that captures the complexity and connectedness of architectural design and the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Results: The results present architectural composition, atmosphere, lighting, natural environment, safety, and security as indispensable design conditions to create an enclosed and city-like campus that provides a serene, secure, and structured environment that benefit staff and adolescent patients. Conclusion: The specific design strategies that need to be incorporated in the architectural design of a safe and secure adolescent psychiatric hospital include an open floor plan that respects patients’ autonomy and offers privacy while always providing staff with full visibility of patients. © The Author(s) 2023.","Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are

(Jones, 2019). One of the main challenges contributing to the limited services is the inadequate
design of adolescent psychiatric hospitals
(McGorry et al., 2013). The impact of the built
environment on patients’ mental health was first
studied in the 1950s (Evans, 2003). Today, after
almost a century, there is still limited information
focused on the cultural and developmental needs
of adolescent psychiatric patients from the built
environment (McGorry et al., 2013). This study
focuses on improving adolescent psychiatric hospital design in a way that directly responds to
their needs.
There are major differences between the needs
of adolescent and children or adults in a psychiatric hospital. Although individuals under the age
of 18 are considered children and may all share
the need of parental support, adolescents require
more control and peer socialization (Borg-Laufs,
2013). While previous studies have proven the
impact of the built environment of a psychiatric
hospital on patients’ positive interactions and
feeling of control and safety, there is a lack of
focus on designing adolescent-specific psychiatric hospitals. This has led to many adolescents
getting admitted to adult or children’s units
(Blumberg & Devlin, 2006; Hutton, 2005).
In a psychiatric hospital, adolescents spend
most of their time in a patient unit under strict
supervision by staff (Chun et al., 2016).
Although this strict supervision is necessary for
patients’ safety, it often leads to aggression and
severely disruptive behavior (Hallman et al.,
2014) toward the staff member working at the
hospital. Staff who work in adolescent psychiatric hospitals may face multiple forms of hostility, aggression, and assault, collectively
referred to as workplace violence that is often
triggered by patients (Hallman et al., 2014;
Ulrich et al., 2018). Studies on environmental
impacts suggest that the built environment
affects patients’ well-being and safety as well
as staff’s satisfaction, working condition, safety,
and health (Sheehan et al., 2013; Trzpuc et al.,
2016). However, most previously published articles are either focused only on adolescent psychiatric hospitals (Hutton, 2005; Gubbels et al.,
2016) or staff members working in these hospitals (Duque et al., 2020; Hallman et al., 2014).
To our knowledge, there are no articles focused
on the impact of the built environment on both
staff and patients. To bridge this gap, the authors
of this study analyzed existing scholarly articles
and conducted interviews at three different state
hospitals with adolescent patient units. Participants’ responses to interviewer prompts highlighted specific architectural categories that
can be applied to designing adolescent psychiatric hospitals.
Method
This study investigates the influence of the built
environment on the health and well-being of adolescent patients and staff of adolescent psychiatric hospitals. The first author responded to a
request for proposal from one of the hospitals for
which she received funding. All procedures were
approved by an institutional review board (IRB).
The site selection began by a web search to identify state psychiatric hospitals that have an adolescent program. The first author then emailed an
invitation to the superintendent of eight hospitals
and asked for their participation. Five hospitals
responded, three of which got approval from their
review boards to participate in the study. These
hospitals (Hospitals A, B, and C) are in urban
setting of different states.
Data Collection
The data collection for this article was conducted
through two phases of (1) literature analyzing and
(2) interviews. The research team searched for
articles published between 2000 and 2020 in the
databases of PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect,
Wiley Online Library, and Cambridge Core. The
key words included architecture of psychiatric
hospitals, adolescent psychiatric hospitals, the
built environment, architecture, interior design,
environmental design, and hospital design. The
article elimination process was first through the
title, followed by the relevancy of the abstract,
and finalized by the review of the full manuscript.
The result was 62 articles of which 22 were analyzed in-depth. Studies were included if they
were (1) peer-reviewed and published in English,
(2) reported design aspects of the hospital
104 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
environment, and (3) explored the impact of the
built environment on patients or staff. After
potential studies were selected, the authors read
and analyzed the articles individually to create a
list of identified design qualities.
Interviews included questions about the participants’ use of the built environment; their
needs from different sections of the hospital;
and the impact of the environment on wellbeing, safety, and productivity of patients and
staff. After the site selection and IRB approval
from the hospital, the first author emailed each
hospital’s superintendent and used snowballing
techniques to identify and contact other participants. This technique is commonly used in qualitative research and requires a key participant
to identify and contact other participants (Daly,
2007). The interviewees of this study include
administrators, adolescent psychologist and
psychiatrist, nurses, therapists, and peer support personnel. Sixty-nine individuals were
interviewed as part of the larger study. For this
analysis, only individuals who had daily interaction with adolescent patients were included in
analysis (n ¼ 30). Each interview lasted
between 30 and 45 min. Adolescent patients
were not interviewed for this study. The interviews collected qualitative data focused on attitudes toward the existing environment,
perception of safety and support, patient interaction and recovery plans, and staff’s need for
rejuvenation and recovery.
Data Analysis
To establish and ensure the validity of study
findings, the authors triangulated multiple data
sources of literature and interviews that led to
the development of a comprehensive understanding of the findings. The analysis of the literature was based on the narrative synthesis
method (Popay et al., 2006) with a preliminary
synthesis done individually by each author to
identify and create a list of design qualities. The
results were then combined, checked, modified,
and verified to achieve 100% agreement by all
authors. Decisions of which themes should be
included were based on this study’s research
question.
Qualitative interviews were recorded using
an iPad and transcribed verbatim by the authors
into a word document. After the first author read
and de-identified the transcriptions, each author
analyzed the transcriptions using a grounded
theory approach that included line-by-line coding, axial coding, and comparative theoretical
coding (Glaser, 1992). The authors first assigned
a code to each relevant line of the transcriptions
to identify ideas, thoughts, feelings, and issues
mentioned by respondents (Charmaz, 2008). The
codes were then sorted and compared across the
responses to draw connections between created
codes. This axial coding formulated categories
of the codes that are most responsive to this
study’s research question and trimmed away
excess codes. The next phase was comparative
theoretical coding (Halberg, 2006) among the
sets of data collected from the three different
hospitals. This process led to systematic connection and contextual arrangement of the categories. The results were initially coded and
categorized by each author and then combined,
checked, modified, and verified to achieve 100%
agreement by all authors.
Results and Discussion
The findings of literature analysis triangulated
and juxtaposed with the results of the interview
analysis informed a set of environmental design
conditions that captures the complexity and connectedness of architectural design and the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric hospital.
Colligating the data revealed a relationship
between the built environment and the success
of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Findings
suggest adolescent psychiatric hospitals must
offer safe and welcoming environments that support patients’ healing and recovery as well as
staff’s satisfaction. In this study, the environmental conditions of the hospital are divided to specific needs of patients and staff. Table 1 presents
all categories that emerged from the data, how
each category is defined in this study for adolescent patients and staff, and several subcategories
that were developed through constant comparative techniques.

The findings of literature analysis
triangulated and juxtaposed with the
results of the interview analysis informed
a set of environmental design conditions
that captures the complexity and
connectedness of architectural design and
the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric
hospital. Colligating the data revealed a
relationship between the built
environment and the success of an
adolescent psychiatric hospital.
Architectural Composition
The architectural composition of an adolescent
psychiatric hospital should respond to adolescents’ psychological needs and healing process
to prepare them for life outside the hospital. It is
important to design the hospital in a way that
patients can freely and safely move between
spaces, participate in different types of therapeutic activities, and interact with each other
and staff (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019; Liddicoat,
2019). One of the participants of this study told
the interviewer that “it is important to offer adolescents control over their environment and
activities [ ... ] to builds up their self-esteem
and help them make friends.” Some of the major
concerns for adolescents with mental illness are
academic difficulties, low educational achievement, low employment, social exclusion, and
possible homelessness (Preyde et al., 2018). The
director of patients’ rights described an ideal
adolescent psychiatric hospital as a small town
where buildings surround a courtyard and there
is a residential unit, a school, and a therapy mall
that includes various therapy rooms, a movie
theater, a pharmacy, a gift store, and a restaurant
to resemble a typical community outside of the
hospital. This enclosed and city-like campus
setting provides a serene, secure, and structured
environment where adolescents can move on the
path of recovery and benefit from the residential
setting, academic programming, and recreational activities. These components contribute
to the “overall success of the patients’ diagnostic process, treatment plan, and the adolescents’
life outside of the hospital,” said one of the psychologists interviewed for this study.
The architectural composition of an
adolescent psychiatric hospital should
respond to adolescents’ psychological
needs and healing process to prepare
them for life outside the hospital.
Accessibility. The interview results presented that
adolescents’ access to different services is one of
the main concerns in state hospitals. These hospitals generally serve both adolescents and
adults on the same campus but are required to
keep the two populations completely separated
for safety and security reasons. Therefore, adolescent units are built in a separate building and
often far away from the adults’ units and the
treatment mall, where the medical and therapeutic services are centralized. Funding limitations
often lead to building one treatment mall to be
shared by both populations but placed closer to
adult units due to the higher number of patients.
A social worker from Hospital A said that “it’s
difficult to bring the children [to the treatment
mall] from all the way on the other end of the
hospital campus,” and the music therapist from
the same hospital suggested that adolescents
“need to have their own therapy spaces, a music
room, art room, physical activities and a gym so
they can stay active.” The adolescent unit at
Hospital B was close to the rest of the campus
and separated only by a courtyard, allowing
patients to share all campus resources by using
them at different times. The director of environmental services from this hospital said, “the kids
have their own playground, but all the sports are
shared and that works when we have enough
staff.” While staffing is a challenge that
designers do not have control over, they can
address campus layout and access to a treatment
mall. One solution is to build a smaller treatment
mall with specific programs only for adolescent
patients, while keeping some of the larger activities such as a basketball court in the main treatment mall for everyone to share.
Norouzi et al. 107
... build a smaller treatment mall with
specific programs only for adolescent
patients, while keeping some of the larger
activities such as a basketball court in the
main treatment mall for everyone to share.
Adjacency. Participants expressed the need for
staff’s visual and audible access to patients from
the nurse station as a necessity of the hospital
design. Adjacency of communal spaces with the
nurse stations offers patients an increased feeling
of freedom and security (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019)
which can help adolescents develop independence, provides a safe space for them to gather
around (Shepley et al., 2016) to increase opportunities for positive interaction, and have a higher
level of connection with staff (Shattell et al.,
2008). This also allows staff to monitor patients
more closely and offer “comfortable seating for
quiet activities near the nurse stations,” said a
nurse at Hospital A. While staff have varying
opinions on open or closed nurse stations,
“patients mostly prefer open without any barrier
such as a plexiglass panel,” said one of the activity nurses at Hospital C. A nurse manager of the
adolescent unit at Hospital B stated “instead of a
glass bubble, we have an open desk in front where
patients gather to talk, read, or work on a puzzle.
The nurses’ offices are in the back of the hub.”
Efficiency. To better serve patients, staff need clear
and quick access to different sections of the adolescent unit as well as different buildings of the
hospital. Circulation and campus planning impact
both functional and psychological aspects of the
workflow by providing fundamental support to
ease the hardship of everyday routines (Jiang, &
Verderber, 2016). It is important to consider the
fastest and safest path for staff to move between
essential locations for patient care and self-care.
Multiple staff members in Hospital A voiced their
concerns about unnecessary distance and wasted
time between the adolescent unit and other units
of the hospital when they need to respond to
emergencies.
Interior layout. It is important to recognize the
appropriate spatial layout and physical spaces of
an adolescent psychiatric hospital in a way that
serves both patients and staff. An open floor plan
is more preferred as it increases face-to-face communication, team interaction, and interdisciplinary collaboration (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019;
Liddicoat, 2019). The nurse manager from Hospital C said, “an open floor plan gives adolescents
the freedom of moving in different spaces while
monitored by staff without being told they can or
cannot go somewhere. It is just easier for everyone.” Adolescents often have difficulties with
interpersonal relationships, social situations,
managing psychiatric symptoms, stigma, and bullying (Preyde et al., 2018). A physician at Hospital A talked about the importance of replicating
family life and social activity in the community to
encourage positive interactions with peers and
improve adolescent patients’ sense of selfworth. An adolescent psychologist from Hospital
C emphasized on the importance of active and
passive behaviors for adolescent patients and said
“there needs to be a place where they can run, be
loud, be teenagers. But they also need a place to
practice being calm.” Examples of interior spaces
that promote active interaction include exercise
and play areas for patients to get engaged in positive movement and exert physical energy
(Trzpuc et al., 2016) and “supervised woodshop
to express creativity with hands-on craft” said the
director of vocational services in Hospital A.
Spaces that inspire passive interactions include
a library, a greenhouse, indoor plants, a spiritual
room (interviewees), quiet rooms, sensory rooms,
dayrooms, and patient rooms with front porches
(Shepley et al., 2016). Offering different types of
spaces provide adolescents a variety of privacy
and opportunities to come together, socialize, and
bond (Hutton, 2005).
Versatility. Versatility is defined as a multipurpose
space that includes built-ins with multiple uses
and can be changed by a single user within minutes (Nanda et al., 2019). Flexible spaces provide
options for spatial configuration and cater to a
wide range of social activities for adolescent
patients. Participants of this study asked for flexible interior spaces that can offer different activities such as “reading, relaxing, playing games,
and watching TV” to help adolescents avoid
108 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
boredom and afford them control over the type of
activity they want to participate in. The Performance Program Supervisor of Hospital B
expressed the need for larger rooms that can be
easily divided and used for different therapy sessions at the same time. The music therapist of
Hospital A said “musical instruments are expensive, and we cannot afford buying multiple of the
same instrument for different units. So, we need a
versatile space that allows the equipment in the
same place to be used at different times.” Therefore, it is important to design versatile spaces with
socio-petal furniture arrangements to promote
positive social interaction, decrease isolation
(Jovanovic´, 2019), facilitate personal space regulation, and provide occupants control of their
environment (Shepley et al., 2016; Ulrich et al.,
2018) in adolescent psychiatric hospitals.
Wayfinding. The ability for adolescent psychiatric
patients to successfully navigate through a care
center is crucial for their daily routine activities.
Wayfinding should be recognized as a high priority when designing psychiatric hospitals as it
can be a challenge in large hospital campuses
with several buildings that lack distinctive
appearance (Devlin, 2014). Inadequate wayfinding and signage can cause aggression or abusive
behavior among patients (Liddicoat, 2019). The
adolescent psychologist from Hospital A emphasized the importance of wayfinding by saying
“these are kids, and they have less patience than
adults [ ... ] they need to go where they want and
get what they want as quickly as possible.” A
wayfinding system needs to be a navigable
and readable environment (Shepley et al., 2017)
and avoid “long corridors, repetitive elements,
and changes of direction within the circulation
system” (Devlin, 2014, pp. 425–426).
Atmosphere
Atmosphere is defined as an emotional reaction to
a specific space and therefore cannot be directly
constructed but emerges from the built environment and its impact on the occupants (Norouzi,
2016). Different architectural characteristics create different atmospheres (Norouzi et al., 2019).
Examples of these characteristics are noise, color,
material, texture, and form that influence spatial
intimacy (Zumthor, 2006), privacy, and autonomy (Norouzi et al., 2019). It is important to
consider the atmosphere of an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it enhances staff and patients’
satisfaction (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019) and wellbeing (Sheehan et al., 2013), increases social
engagement (Trzpuc at al., 2016), and reduces
stress (Ulrich et al., 2018).
Acoustics. Sound and noise can range from stressful to soothing and therapeutic and impact staff,
patients, and visitors of a hospital. An appropriate
acoustic environment benefits staff’s well-being
and patients’ therapy process (Zhou et al., 2020).
However, appropriate acoustic design has not
been a priority in psychiatric hospitals (Shepley
et al., 2017). Unwanted sounds and noise such as
traffic, trains, airports, and community noise
within a hospital unit can hinder staff’s work productivity and communication quality with
patients while causing psychological distress and
helplessness among patients (Shepley et al.,
2017; Ulrich et al., 2018). The director of admissions in Hospital B said, “we need a quiet therapeutic space as staff break room in each unit so
they can relax and unwind but available to
respond to emergencies when needed.” A physical therapist from Hospital C said, “the breeze
through the trees, birds chirping, and sound of
water create a calm environment for patients and
staff. [ ... ], there needs to be a way to have pleasant sound both inside and outside the unit.”
Incorporating acoustic floor and ceiling tiles, wall
panels, movable partition panels, and solid core
doors can mitigate unwanted noise transmissions
(Liddicoat, 2019). Providing single bedrooms in
adolescent psychiatric hospitals enhances privacy
and reduces noise levels from adjacent patient
neighbors (Ulrich et al., 2018). Indoor sensory
rooms can provide opportunities for patients to
listen to music or pleasant nature sounds.
Autonomy. Autonomy, as independence or freedom of choice, is an element often forgotten in
psychiatric hospitals and even more so for adolescents. Respecting patients’ autonomy starts by
providing privacy options. Lack of privacy results
in heightened anxiety levels, stress, and
Norouzi et al. 109
aggression (Liddicoat, 2019). A way to provide
privacy is through offering single bedrooms for
patients. Single bedrooms with private bathrooms
encourage social engagement (Trzpuc et al.,
2016); offers therapeutic security and comfort,
expression of ownership, opportunity to personalize and decorate the space (Shepley et al., 2017),
and freedom to withdraw when feeling unwell
(Jovanovic´ et al., 2019); and improve the dignity
and safety of patients (Sheehan et al., 2013). Private bedrooms can provide a greater “sense of
personal control and security,” said one of the
interviewees. This can be provided by offering
access to technology such as television for entertainment, phone, or computer to stay connected
with family, control over the temperature of their
room for comfort, private lockers to store their
belongings in their bedroom, and most importantly options in the type of activities to be
involved in.
Perception. Offering choices increases an individual’s sense of control and can provide opportunities for patients to modify and personalize their
environment based on personal perceptions (Bergamin et al., 2022; Pasha & Shepley, 2017).
While this is important and possible for personal
spaces, perception is based on interpretation of
experiences (Pasha & Shepley, 2017) and varies
for different people. Therefore, it is difficult to
accommodate in designing public spaces. One of
the most recognized topics in relation to psychiatric hospitals is creating a deinstitutionalized and
homelike environment. Previous studies presented homelike environments can be created
through light and soothing colors, cheerful and
welcoming facade and entrances, use of local
materials and design characteristics (Li, 2018),
clean floors and comfortable furniture (Shepley
et al., 2017), nontextured interior walls (Wang
et al., 2020), view of nature and landscape painting (Evans, 2003), and indoor plants (Duque
et al., 2020) to improve patients and staff’s satisfaction. Although these points are agreed upon in
most research studies, the perception of the space
is influenced by individuals’ associational meaning of the surrounding environment (Wang et al.,
2020) and can be different for many individuals.
Participants described a homelike environment as
a comfortable place with “bright colors, familiar
items from home, a way to listen to music and
podcasts, natural light, comfortable flooring, nice
variety of indoor plants, and outdoor gardens.”
However, the concept of comfort was not defined
by any of the participants.
Another controversial subject related to perception is color. A music therapist interviewed
for this study, said “bright colors could be very
over stimulating because some folks have sensory
deficits.” Yildirim et al. (2011) confirms this by
stating that warm colors provoke active feelings
and, in some cases, increase anxiety. Contrary to
these statements, the chief of psychiatry in Hospital B suggested that “warmer colors are better
than cool blues for the common areas because
they encourage interaction and communication.”
One staff member interviewed for this study said,
“anything but light blues and greens [ ... ] that
feels like an asylum from the old movies; very
institutionalized, not homey at all,” but Yildirim
et al. (2011) suggest that cool colors make the
space feel peaceful, relaxing, and calm.
Respite. In response to a highly stressful work
environment of a psychiatric hospital and to contribute to the staff’s reduction of stress, burnout,
and fatigue, while offering them opportunities to
relax, focus, and concentrate (Nejati et al., 2015),
it is important to create indoor and outdoor
relaxation and rejuvenation areas specific to staff.
Interviewees of this study asked for a balance
between passive and active respite such as a meditation room and a basketball court. Areas of
respite serve as a place to withdraw and seek
refuge from patients and families along with
allowing privacy and socialization with coworkers (Liddicoat, 2019). The staff break area
should include artwork, indoor plants, windows
with outdoor views and access to nature by offering opportunities to walk through gardens,
receive direct sunlight, and listen to the sound
of birds or water (Nejati et al., 2015). Interviewees of this study described the importance of
incorporating access to covered patios, fitness
areas, and outdoor walking trails and asked for
centralized break rooms near work areas, so they
can step away from a hectic work environment,
think and regroup their thoughts.

... it is important to create indoor and
outdoor relaxation and rejuvenation areas
specific to staff.
Lighting
Exposure to light impacts the circadian rhythm
which synchronizes the body’s internal clock and
regulates the sleep cycle (Joseph, 2006). Inadequate exposure to light can lead to reduced cognitive abilities, anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue,
stress, and depression, along with vulnerability
to seasonal affective disorder (Evans, 2003;
White et al., 2013). Therefore, integrating natural
and artificial light in the design of an adolescent
psychiatric hospital is essential for improving
workplace performance for staff and enhancing
patients’ recovery process. It is necessary to
incorporate windows, and skylights allow natural
light into the built environment (Jiang & Verderber, 2016) and select appropriate noninstitutional
lighting fixtures to provide adequate light distribution for day and night usage.
Artificial lighting. Lighting is linked with a sense of
comfort and well-being. Consequently, when
daylight is not sufficient, artificial lighting must
compensate for and provide adequate lighting
that extends the field of view in play areas for
adolescent patients and creates ideal working
conditions for staff. Electric lighting is used to
positively impact mood, circadian rhythm, sleep
cycle, and task performance and decrease depression and length of stay in a hospital (Shepley
et al., 2017). Adequate exposure to artificial light
is essential for night-shift staff in a psychiatric
hospital as it readjusts their circadian rhythm and
helps with irregular sleep–wake schedules that
could lead to health problems (Joseph, 2006).
Artificial lighting design considerations include
glare and shadow-free light distribution, daylight
sensors, dimmers, switch controllers, and high
and uniform luminance.
Natural lighting. Daylight should be prioritized
when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it affects staff and patients’ physical and
psychological health. Inadequate light has a
direct effect on fatigue, insomnia, and other psychiatric diseases (Evans, 2003; Nabil & Mardaljevic, 2006; Shepley et al., 2016). Exposure to
natural lighting can impact staff and patients by
enabling performance of visual tasks (Peek-Asa
et al., 2009), affecting mood and perception (Partonen & Lonnqvist, 2000), controlling the body’s
circadian system and improving sleep cycle
(Boubekri et al., 2014), decreasing aggression
(Ulrich et al., 2014), depression, and anxiety as
well as facilitating wayfinding (Evans, 2003; Liddicoat, 2019; Shepley et al., 2017). The music
therapist in Hospital A mentioned the importance
of integrating natural daylight in adolescent psychiatric hospitals and said, “the kids are generally
happier and more willing to sit through the therapy session in the room with windows and
sunlight.”
Natural Environment
Connection and access to the natural environment
can positively impact physical and mental health
of individuals by improving cognitive abilities,
increasing the sense of belonging and self-worth
(Hammell, 2021), helping patients focus on their
inner healing resources, and offering staff a place
of respite and visitors a relaxed setting to interact
with loved ones (Marcus, 2007). Designing a connection to the natural environment in an adolescent psychiatric hospital can be accomplished
through biophilic design with the goal of providing a healing environment that promotes wellbeing for staff and patients. This could be
achieved by offering direct and indirect connections to natural elements and incorporating
nature-centric spaces with activities ranging from
passive to active (Marcus, 2007). Interviewees
described nature-centric environments as spaces
that include plants, trees, natural materials, artwork, color, water features, and animals. Interviewees also mentioned Zen gardens, planters, green
courtyards, and walking trails as examples of
places that provide opportunities for different levels of activities.
Biophilia. Biophilic design focuses on incorporating nature into the built environment to advance
people’s health, fitness, and well-being.
Norouzi et al. 111
Integrating biophilia in the design of an adolescent psychiatric facility can promote passive and
active interactions. Marcus (2007) lists these
interactions as viewing the garden through a window, sitting outside, dozing/napping/meditating,
gentle rehabilitation exercises, walking to preferred spots, raised bed gardening, and participating in sports. Designing passive connections to
nature can create a temporary escape from an
oppressive atmosphere, offering hope of rapid
recovery, along with experiencing the change in
time, throughout the day and improving the quality of daily routines for staff and patients (Nejati
et al., 2015). An intervention coach from Hospital
C said, “more open spaces with outdoor visibility
and decorative paneling or paintings of nature in
different spaces will help patients feel at peace.”
Nature art presents distinct synergistic benefits
that can impact the psychosocial well-being of
patients by increasing self-esteem and decreasing
social isolation (Thomson et al., 2020). Displaying nature art can reduce patient anxiety and agitation (Shepley et al., 2017) and decrease the use
of anxiety medication (Nanda et al., 2019). The
dentist in Hospital A said, “there’s a mural in our
main walkway that has trees, koala bears, giraffes, and many patients love it” and “it makes
them happy; it makes them think of something
besides their delusions. It’s relaxing.” An adolescent patient who had learned about architects
interviewing members of the hospital wrote a
message and asked a nurse to deliver it to the
research team. The note read,
I like to see artwork that is made by some of us.
There are people here, like this guy in my unit who
draws very nicely. We can have his drawings on the
wall. The big sculptures in the garden are nice too;
specially to look at and relax on a sunny day.
Courtyard. Courtyards, outdoor spaces surrounded
by buildings, can provide opportunities for
recreational activities, play, and gardening. Interviewees of this study requested having multiple
small courtyards accessible to patients for different types of activities. It is important for adolescent patients to have a place to exert their energy
throughout the day (Shepley et al., 2016), and
they are most likely to be physically active in
an outdoor environment that includes greenery
(Gubbels et al., 2016). Patients with the opportunity to walk in a garden, be around diverse plants
and flowers, listen to the sound of water, and
receive direct sunlight are reported to be less
stressed (Nejati et al., 2015). The interviewees
of this study expressed interests for walking trails
that are close to buildings where both patients and
staff can go on daily walks. They also asked for
outdoor areas that are set up for sports, relaxation,
weight training, play structure, running, and biking, and outdoor shaded seating areas for staff.
Although there were inquiries for different
types of gardens, the most requested green spaces
were therapeutic and vegetable gardens. Most
interviewees indicated that attributes of a healing
environment as spending time with plants and
water features. These activities can reduce anxiety, provide positive distractions for patients, and
offer them opportunities to be involved in their
own recovery and healing process (Liddicoat,
2019). This can also allow staff to cope with
bereavement, process stressful work situations,
spend quality time, and work with adolescent
patients outside of the hospital building (Marcus,
2007). Therapeutic gardens should provide views
to the sky and changing cloud formations, a plentiful supply of plant materials with distinctive
seasonal changes, subtleties of color and texture,
with leaves or grass that move with the slightest
breeze (Marcus, 2007), as well as safe water features where patients can see and hear the water
but not drink it. Interviewees talked about the
benefits of gardening and planting vegetables to
be tremendous for patients as it could help them
practice acceptance, understanding the process of
growth, living in the moment, and eating healthy.
Safety and Security
Safety is a major factor in adolescent psychiatric
hospitals, as patients can become violent and
aggressive when irritated. Tense or escalating
situations often arise between patients in psychiatric hospitals in which staff members need to
intervene. Design features such as efficient visibility and circulation that maximizes line of sight
throughout the facility, reduces blind spots from
corridor nooks, and provides multiple exit points
112 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
that improve accessibility, as well as anti-ligature
equipment, durable and heavy furniture, and shatterproof windows (Carr, 2017).
Boundary. Physical indicators that define the use
of space can allow for different types and levels
of interaction by determining separations or
offering connections (Norouzi et al., 2019). A
nurse in Hospital C said, “boundaries are for connection as much as they are for separation [... ],
windows connect the patients to the outdoors
even on a hot day when they can’t go outside.”
The nurse continued by saying: Windows from
the patients’ room to the hallway offer safety and
privacy by allowing staff to check on patients
without entering the room. Boundaries for separation are essential for safety and security to keep
adolescents in their own healing environment and
away from adult patients and the public.
High risk. Equipment that can be used by patients
for self-harm are considered high-risk factors.
These can be eliminated with the appropriate use
of durable building materials, damage-resistant
furniture, and anti-ligature equipment (Carr,
2017; Shepley, 2017). The head nurse in Hospital
A described the importance of avoiding sharp corners and objects used throughout the unit in which
patients can use to harm themselves or others.
Visibility. Patient visibility and efficient circulation
are imperative when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital, as it has a direct influence on the
safety of staff and patients. A central nurse station
within an adolescent unit is crucial for providing
staff with maximum patient visibility (Shepley
et al., 2016). Although open nurse stations provide better visibility and support staff capability
to anticipate and prevent aggressive behavior
(Ulrich et al., 2018), most staff members at Hospitals A and C said that they feel safer in enclosed
stations. In other studies, decentralized nurse stations positively influenced proximity to patients
in a larger design footprint as well as time spent
with patients (Fay et al., 2017). Another important factor to consider are blind spots that can be
created by walls or furniture. Interviewees suggested the use of convex mirrors or cameras to
offer visibility. Although video surveillance
provides additional security and can increase
patients’ choice about monitoring options, it can
have adverse effects on patients’ well-being and
cause symptoms of fear, distrust, and paranoia
(Appenzeller et al., 2019). These dubious facts
are due to lack of imperial evidence and lead to
difficulty in considering video surveillance beneficial or hindering. We recommend that future
studies to consider representing adolescents in the
design of psychiatric hospitals by including them
in the interviews or surveys for data collection."
10.1016/j.asej.2022.101975,A framework for the design of pediatric healthcare environment using the Delphi technique,2023,"By investigating specific therapeutic goals and design considerations, this paper aims to develop a framework for the design of a pediatric healthcare-built environment. Growing body of research indicates that the characteristics of pediatric healthcare facilities differ from those of adult healthcare facilities, therefore the findings of adult healthcare facility design cannot be generalized to pediatric healthcare facility design. Moreover, the studies specifically focusing on the built environment in pediatric healthcare are also sparse. Literature studies were conducted to extract therapeutic goals and design considerations. Two rounds of the Delphi technique were used to extract the Indian experts’ opinions, and to make a consensus among the experts on each goal and design considerations. SPPS software was used to calculate statistical output i.e., mean, standard deviation (SD), Interquartile range (IQR), coefficient of variation (CV), and boxplots. Results were drawn with the help of statistical data and boxplots. Finally, eight therapeutic goals and 33 design considerations emerged which may contribute towards designing pediatric healthcare environments. The design considerations will aid architects and facility planners in making design decisions for new or renovated pediatric healthcare facilities. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","A healing environment aid recovery of the patient; reduce
patient stress, and length of stay in hospitals [1]; have both physical and non-physical parameters. The parameters of healthcare
environments include architectural design features; environmental attributes; air quality; noise; thermal comfort; privacy; natural light; outside view of nature; safety and security; and access
to nature [2]. The parameters of the pediatric healthcare environment also include the creation of child-friendly environments [3],
therapeutic play, family support and artwork for positive
distraction.
The parameters of a child-friendly environment have been
investigated in a variety of ways to determine what makes an environment child-friendly [3,4]. The childcare facilities should be
planned near schools and parks to have access to healthy, and safe
surroundings; and visual links between the indoor and outdoor
spaces are also important [5]. By incorporating the viewpoints of
children, the physical, cultural, and social environments can be
made child friendly. Children prefer to see healthcare facilities as
a home-like environment, which includes family eating and
kitchen facilities [6]. Experts also expressed the importance of
flooring in childcare facilities to prevent patient fall.
Nature and outside views, lower stress, allowing patients to
recuperate quickly [7] and influence patient well-being. Garden
visibility, accessibility, and the provision of child-sized furniture
are all essential factors in encouraging garden use [8]. The garden
visibility can be improved by placing colorful brochures in high
traffic areas [9]. In addition, the outside views from the window
can increase patient satisfaction [5].
Privacy during hospitalization can reduce anxiety, on the other
hand, insufficient privacy may cause children to get stressed. While
patients need privacy, staff members also need to see the patient,
ensure their safety and wellbeing [10]. The patient’s privacy may
be impacted by the space design, position of toilet and location
of the patient’s bed and its interactions with other design elements
[11,12].
Positive distraction has a significant effect in reducing patient
stress and is found to be beneficial for children [13,14]. The use

of artwork, realistic scenes can enhance the mood of hospitalized
children [15,16]. Installation of murals, virtual ponds, aquariums
has been found to have physiological effects on the positive health
outcomes of pediatric patients [17,18].
Play is critical for a child’s physical, social, and cognitive development. Shared, handheld play options pose a risk of infections,
however, aquariums, and interactive media provides play opportunities for differently-abled children [13]. Atriums, waiting halls,
hospital gardens and other public spaces be carefully designed to
provide self-directed play activities [19]. Younger children and
adolescents prefer distinct play zones based on their age and
developmental stage [20].
The psychological and emotional support of family to a pediatric patient has been explored by many studies and it has been
reported that the family has a significant role in the care process
[21]. It is important to provide spaces where both patients and
families can be effectively included in the patient room [22]. Children have more opportunities to do things i.e. play with toys, use a
computer, and mingle with peers when they are in age-appropriate
activity spaces [5,23].
Children must be kept safe from abduction and accidental collisions in childcare facilities. It is possible to create a safe environment with a sound-absorbing, slip-resistant floor by specifying
materials that are both attractive and functional [24]. Nursing stations should be located in such a way so that nurses can keep eye
on visitors [23].
A comfortable physical environment contributes significantly
towards faster recovery and better health outcomes. Pelander
[25], stressed the need of engaging the children in the process of
care. Single bed patient rooms are comfortable in terms of social
support and can substantially reduce noise and infection [26]. Adolescents feel discomfort with the crying of babies. Birch et al. [5],
suggested segregating the baby wards from the wards of
adolescents.
Healthcare institutions must evaluate their design quality, optimize health environment design to increase efficiency, and create
appropriate healing environments for patients. Although previous
research has shown that design has a major impact on health outcomes, evidence-based design is still in its infancy [27]. It is critical
for facility planners to address the experiences of sick children and
their families while in the hospital [28].
India’s growing pediatric population and rising affordability
highlight the need for better healthcare facilities in the country.
Despite having the highest percentage of children aged 0 to 18
(39 % of the country’s population), India only has a few pediatric
hospitals with basic infrastructure. Existing healthcare research
has mainly focused on general hospitals rather than on specific
hospitals i.e., pediatric hospitals and certainly not in the Indian
context. Children are not small adults, and their needs are different
in terms of their physiological and psychological characteristics,
the findings of adult care facilities cannot be replicated in pediatric
facilities.
In India, childcare is delivered in a variety of hospital type: general hospitals with pediatric departments; stand-alone children’s
hospital; and private clinics of pediatricians. There are many general and super speciality hospitals in the nation that treat patients
of all age groups. However, these hospitals lack specific environment needed to provide optimal care to infants, children with a
multidisciplinary approach centered on child. There are few stanalone children’s hospitals; two examples are 221 bedded, Chacha
Nehru Bal Chikitshalya (CNBC) in New Delhi; and 400 bedded
and Post Graduate Institute of Child Health (PGICH) in Noida, Uttar
Pradesh. Although these institutions offer improved childcare, they
fall short in many areas, such as creating a child friendly environment, therapeutic play, and family and peer support because there
are no guidelines in place.
The objective of this study is to create a framework for the
design of pediatric healthcare facilities in the Indian context, to
meet the industry’s pressing demand for making healthcare design
evidence more accessible and actionable. This study reveals how
pediatric healthcare surroundings have a major impact on patient
quality of care, safety, and staff satisfaction and efficiency. The
framework includes the design considerations for pediatric healthcare environments and can be used for design optimization for new
and renovation projects.
This article conceptualizes the healthscape quality of pediatric
healthcare facilities in India using the Delphi consultation methodology and provides a framework, supported by evidence on how
various factors affect the design quality. This construct considers
not just the conventional healthscape criteria (i.e., layout, ambience, and texture) but also new dimensions appropriate for designing pediatric healthcare institutions (i.e., child-friendly
environment; therapeutic play; artwork for positive distraction;
and family & peer support).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Delphi method
The Delphi method, developed at Rand Corporation in 1950 by
Dalkey and Helmer, is a widely used iterative process and accepted
method for convergence of opinion regarding real-world knowledge using a series of questionnaires requested from experts
within specific issue areas [29]. The main objective of a Delphi
study is to obtain consensus on the assessment of data from a
group of respondents. A chosen set of respondents is questioned
through a series of questionnaires and the results of the first round
are used to generate the next round. As soon as questions for which
respondent’s consensus are achieved, those questions are dropped.
The second round of questioning is used to further explore any
issues on which there is no consensus.
The size of the expert’s panel and the response rate of the
experts are important factors for Delphi consultation. According
to Skulmoski [30], when the group is small, a smaller sample
between ten to fifteen experts may yield sufficient results. There
is no strict rule for panel size [31], the author discovered that in
56 % of prior Delphi research, the number of participants was up
to 30.
Two rounds of the Delphi-based consultation method were
employed after the elements for design considerations were generated to reveal new aspects from Indian experts in related fields. In
this Delphi consultation, 30 experts were employed in round one
and 28 experts in round two. (Table 1). A 5-point Likert scale
was used to collect expert feedback. Finally, after a thorough examination of experts’ opinions and statistical analysis, the final design
considerations were compiled.
2.2. Identifying therapeutic goals and design considerations
A review of the literature was conducted to identify therapeutic
goals and design considerations. Using open-ended questionnaires,
five experts were asked to provide their opinion related to the
design of pediatric healthcare facilities to generate new ideas/concepts. This process yielded eight therapeutic goals and 34 design
considerations (Table 2). Through interviews with professors, caregivers/doctors, healthcare architects, research fellows, research
scholars and nurses feedback concerning pediatric healthcare
design was obtained and their suggestions were incorporated to
finalize the list of therapeutic goals and design considerations.

2.3. Measuring consensus
Even though the primary goal of the Delphi technique is to
achieve consensus between experts, there is no consistent
measurement practice. As a result, some studies use a frequency
distribution to measure agreements, while others use standard
deviation and interquartile range [31]. According to Zervas [31],
10 points and 5 points Likert scale has been most commonly used
in the previous studies.
The consensus is said to be achieved by combining the following three measures in the case of a 5-point Likert scale.
a) The 51 % of experts who answered ‘‘strongly agreed” in the
category (which is between values 4 and 5 on a 5-point Likert scale)
b) The interquartile range less than 1
c) The standard deviation (SD) is less than 1.5 [31].
According to Dajani et al. [32], the Coefficient of variation (CV) is
another method of judging agreements. If the CV is in between 0
and 0.5, a good degree of consensus has been achieved and a second Delphi round is not needed; if the CV is in between 0.5 and
0.8, a consensus is less satisfactory and another round may be
required; and if the CV is 0.8, it has a poor level of consensus [33].

3. Results
SPSS software has been used to calculate mean, standard deviation (SD), interquartile range (IQR), coefficient of variation (CV),
(Table 2); and boxplots (Figs. 1-8).
3.1. Child-friendly built environment
It can be seen from Fig. 1, that A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7 have negative skew implying many experts awarded high scores compared
to the average, and the mean values are in the range of 4 to 5.
Table 2, and Fig. 1 shows good ratings (mean values), and good
agreement (IQR = 1.0 each), which indicates consensus in the first
round for A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7. Experts considered these factors
as important.
Positive skew is seen in A3, indicating a larger percentage of
participants provided a lower score than the mean. IQR = 2.0 indicates that experts have a weak agreement, a consensus has not
been achieved in the initial round. This factor was rephrased by
specifying the singly loaded corridor with the view of the outside,
which received a good score and strong agreement in the subsequent round. A6 has a lower score, week agreement (IQR = 2.3)
and negative skew in the first round. Even after rephrasing the
question, this factor didn’t achieve consensus in the second round
(IQR = 2.0), as experts found it unfeasible to provide a family
kitchen near-patient room in the Indian context, hence this factor
is not included in the final list.
3.2. Nature and outdoors
Fig. 2 and Table 2 show, all the factors scored high (mean value
# 4 to 5) and have a strong agreement (IQR = 1.0). Except for B3,
which has positive skew; B1, B2, B3, and B5 have a negative skew.
The CVs lies less than 0.2 which indicates a good degree of consensus and no need to go for the second round. Experts agreed that the
criteria: B1, B3 & B4 as important considerations.
3.3. Privacy
Fig. 3 and Table 2 indicates negative skew, high score, and very
strong agreement for C1. Privacy can be enhanced by providing
attached toilets in patient rooms. C2 has a very low score and
low median value, experts argued that providing all single-bed
patient rooms in the Indian context is not a feasible option, hence
this factor is not considered in the second round. C3 and C5 have
negative skew, high scores & strong agreement (IQR) in the first
round. Experts valued the installation of movable partitions in
shared rooms as an important criterion.
C4 and C6 have week agreements (IQR = 2.0) in the first round.
These criteria were rephrased. In the second round, C4 & C6 got a
high score, strong agreement, and CVs less than 0.16, which indicates consensus among experts. Inboard toilets provide better natural light and outside views to patient rooms.
3.4. Positive distraction
D1 achieved a high score, positive skew which means many
experts provided score lower than the mean but has got an acceptable level of agreement (IQR). Experts argued that the use of
brightly colored items are encouraged in pediatric facilities but
at the same time color choices differs among age groups. D2 has
got a low score and weak agreement (IQR) in the first round, so this
factor was rephrased, which received a high score and strong
agreement in the next round.
D3 and D4 received high scores, strong agreement, and negative
skew. Experts agreed that wall-murals, virtual ponds, aquariums
(D3), and drawing, and artwork can be used as a positive distraction strategy (Fig. 4, and Table 2).
3.5. Therapeutic play
Fig. 5 and Table 2, show that E1 and E2 both received high
scores, albeit E1 has a negative skew while E2 has a positive skew.
Both have received strong agreement (IQR), experts agreed to provide distinct play zones based on the type of activity & age group
(E1) and to provide non-contact play options to control infection
(E2). E3 did not achieve a high score in the first round. In the second round, so this factor was rephrased, as ‘‘allow play items
brought from home in the patient rooms"" which has got a high
score and strong agreement.

3.6. Family and peer support
F1, F2 and F3, all received high scores and overwhelming agreement in the first round. Fig. 6 and Table 2 show that F1 and F3 have
negative skew, implying a large percentage of experts ranked
greater than the average score. All three factors achieved consensus in the first round, and hence second round is not required.
Experts viewed the presence of family and interaction with peers
as an important characteristic.
3.7. Safety and security
Fig. 7 and Table 2 indicate that all the three factors have
achieved high scores, strong agreement, and positive skew,
which means that experts viewed all the three factors as extremely important in terms of child safety. Placement of nursing
stations in relation to patient rooms to have better visibility of
patients has been recognized as an important design
consideration.

3.8. Comfort
All the criteria’s related to patient comfort i.e., H1, H2 and H3
received high scores, strong agreement (IQR) and have negative
skew, which indicates that experts strongly agree with all the factors. Comfortable patient rooms, segregation of baby wards from
older patients, and nature views through windows have achieved
strong consensus among experts and therefore the second round
is not needed (Fig. 8 and Table 2).

4. Discussion
This paper used a qualitative and quantitative approach to
develop a framework for the pediatric healthcare facility. As the
pediatric healthcare facility design is complex & multi-faceted,
and the planning & decision making is also done by heterogeneous
groups [38], inputs from multi-disciplinary experts were obtained
to get a comprehensive perspective. The review of related literature and the opinion of the experts (concept generation round)
paved the way for the further development of questionnaires for
subsequent rounds of Delphi consultation. In the first Delphi
round, 34 design considerations were presented across 8 domains.
The data obtained from the first round of Delphi was analysed
using SPSS software, in terms of central tendency and level of
agreement among experts. 28 out of 34 items (82 %) achieved consensus in the first round. Only those items, which did not receive
consensus in the first round were presented in the second round.
C2 had the lowest score (mean value = 1.46) and strong agreement
(IQR), experts unanimously believe that providing all single bedded patient rooms is not a feasible option in the Indian context,
hence C2 was eliminated from the second round. Nine items were
rephrased and presented in the second round, and the result was
analyzed by SPSS software. The final list of design considerations
has 33 items in 8 domains (Table 3).
5. Conclusions
This paper investigated the therapeutic goals and design considerations related to pediatric healthcare settings by reviewing
the existing literature and with the support from participating
experts and design professionals using two rounds of the Delphi
and presented a framework for easy and effective implementation
of research evidence in design practice. The development of a
framework for pediatric facilities is a critical step in healthcare
research. This framework may be further expanded, validated for
better integration in the design decision process. These design considerations will aid architects and facility planners in making
design decisions for new or renovated pediatric healthcare facilities to improve the facility’s efficacy, performance, and aesthetics"
