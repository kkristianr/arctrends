10.1177/19375867231177304,Application of the Childbirth Supporter Study to Advance the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool,2024,"Objective: Translational research to advance design criteria and apply the Childbirth Supporter Study (CSS) findings to practice. Background: The physical design of birth environments has not undergone substantial improvements in layout or ambiance since the initial move to hospitals. Cooperative, continuously present childbirth supporters are beneficial and are an expectation for most modern birth practices, yet the built environment does not offer support for the supporter. Methods: To advance design criteria, we use a comparative case study approach to create translational findings. Specifically, CSS findings were used as indicators to advance the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET) design characteristics in pursuit of better support for childbirth supporters in the built hospital birth environment. Results: This comparative case study provides eight new BUDSET design domain suggestions to benefit the supporter-woman dyad, and subsequently the baby and care providers. Conclusions: Research-informed design imperatives are needed to guide the inclusion of childbirth supporters as both a supporter and as an individual in the birth space. Increased understanding of relationships between specific design features and childbirth supporters’ experiences and reactions are provided. Suggestions to enhance the applicability of the BUDSET for birth unit design facility development are made, specifically ones that will better accommodate childbirth supporters. © The Author(s) 2023.","There are well-recognized benefits for both
mother and baby when the woman receives support from a chosen birth companion as reflected
in Cochrane reviews (Bohren et al., 2017; Hodnett et al., 2013) and by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), yet we claim a dichotomy
in current birth environment design exists which
does not reflect this knowledge. While in most
resource-rich nations, a continuous supporter is
expected to accompany the woman throughout
her labor and birth experience, the supporter is
usually not well accommodated in the birth space
(Johansson et al., 2015, Minnie et al., 2018) and
subsequently may be unable to function effectively in their support role.
In their role, supporters often feel overwhelmed, anxious, or uncertain (Gawlik et al.,
2015). Although recent design guidelines show
an awareness of supporters’ importance, it
appears supporters have been overlooked when
it comes to birth environment design (Harte
et al., 2016).
Although recent design guidelines show
an awareness of supporters’ importance,
it appears supporters have been
overlooked when it comes to birth
environment design (Harte et al., 2016).
Hospital culture, sociocultural and material/
technological context are interwoven influences
(Maffi, 2016) affecting this claim. Healthcare
settings are inherently complex spaces that
provide endless challenges for designers to
accommodate all necessary delivery of care
components (van Hoof et al., 2015). Within
architectural and design practice, the demand for
efficient execution of each commission allows
few opportunities for user-based research
(Andrade et al., 2012); therefore, it is important
that rigorous research findings are regularly
incorporated into design practice.
Design assessment tools, akin to guidelines,
are both embraced and resisted by practitioners
who dislike the prescriptive “checklist”
approach while also needing to incorporate the
latest best-practice evidence-based design
knowledge into their project within the budgeted
time frame (Brambilla et al., 2019; Moore et al.,
2015). This tension of bringing evidence into
practice is an ongoing effort and opportunity for
improvement on the part of environment design
behavior researchers, as well as for many other
design and architectural fields (Forsythe, 2018).
We join others to claim evidence-based design is
a key design process for childbirth environment
design, especially for patient comfort and reducing stress (Brambilla et al., 2019; O’Callaghan
et al., 2019).
Aim
The aim of this comparative case study is twofold: (1) to present research-informed design principles developed from the video-ethnographic
Childbirth Supporter Study (CSS; Harte et al.,
2016) and based on the comparison of these results
(2) to discuss and suggest refinements to the Birth
Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET
version October 2, 2010), the leading assessment
tool for physical birth environments to better
reflect the needs of childbirth supporters in hospital contexts.
The Study Case Setting
and Context
The research presented here is a comparative
case study, which will be explained further in
the Method section. The two cases compared are
the CSS (Harte et al., 2016) and the BUDSET
(version October 2, 2010; Foureur, Leap, et al.,
2010; Foureur et al., 2011). The CSS is an
empirical study conducted as part of a doctoral
dissertation (Harte, 2015), while the BUDSET is
both a conceptual and empirical pilot research
Harte et al. 149
study (Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al.,
2011). Both CSS and BUDSET occurred in Australia between 2011 and 2016, while the comparative case study research presented here,
which is both empirical and theoretical, occurred
between 2015 and 2022.
We draw on research into the experiences of
childbirth supporters from the CSS (Harte et al.,
2016) to initiate discussion around the inclusion
of supporter needs in birth environment design.
We use the BUDSET as a second case to compare
the CSS results to, as a technique for improving
the BUDSET, with the goal of facilitating
improved experiences for childbirth supporters.
We refer to Version 2.0 developed in 2010
throughout this article. For an abbreviated BUDSET, see Table S1 in the Online Supplements.
To lay the groundwork for the comparative
case study, we first provide a brief background
of childbirth supporters in the designed birth
space, the theoretical framework and the methods
used for the CSS, and an overview of the BUDSET before turning our attention to the comparative case study.
Supporters in the Designed Birth
Environment
Supporters, for this research, are defined as
untrained companions from the woman’s personal network (Harte, 2015). Professional supporters may also benefit from the results
presented here, however; they are not the focus.
Birth supporter’s roles include many activities,
including physical comfort and touch (for
instance, massage, wiping the woman’s forehead,
holding her hand, providing ice chips/water;
Johansson et al., 2012). Psychological and affective support (both overt and covert) are equally
important, including verbal encouragement, eye
contact, and active listening and positive response
to expressions of pain or fear the woman may
convey (Johansson et al., 2012).
The softer aspects of care can be facilitated
with reimagined birth spaces harmoniously rich
with sensory, color, and light/dark patterns that
foster a supportive atmosphere (Balabanoff,
2017). A range of accommodation types enable
the supporter to regulate their participation type
and level, with confidence in assisting at the birth,
as shown in the scoping review of eight crucial
building spaces in maternity care (Setola et al.,
2019).
Theoretical Frameworks
As this comparative case study is centered on the
CSS as a central axis, or case, the following
briefly describes the CSS theoretical framework
and analysis technique. The theoretical underpinnings, methods and research design for CSS are
described in detail in related publications (Harte
et al., 2017; Harte et al., 2014). The CSS comprises ethnography (as both a research collection
technique and as a theory), “birth territory” theory (Fahy et al., 2008; Fahy & Parratt, 2006), and
the “safe, satisfying birth” hypothesis (Foureur,
Davis, et al., 2010) to support the data collection
method, while symbolic interactionism (Blumer,
1986; Prus, 1996) and a thematic coding
approach informed by both Saldan˜a (2013) and
the activities, environment, interactions, objects
and users (AEIOU) framework originally developed by Wasson (2000) guided the data
interpretation.
The above-described theoretical framework
grounds the CSS and supports the process for the
comparative case study, while the comparative
case study adopts the additional theoretical
framework of critical theory. Broadening the
view of each case to include the phenomena in
question—how better to support childbirth supporters in the design environment—the comparative case study attends to power and inequality,
informed by Marxist, feminist, and critical race
theory (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017). Questioning the
evidence with a “meaning-making,” theoretical
stance is a hallmark for the comparative case
study approach, as it facilitates both an
unbounded frame and active iteration to progress
the complex field of birth environment design.
Case 1: The Childbirth Supporter
Study
This and the following section describe the cases
compared. The first case is the CSS and the
second case is the BUDSET. The CSS is a
150 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1)
video-ethnographic case study of one family’s
experience. This included eight participants (one
woman, her partner and three family supporters,
plus three midwives), 1-hr of video footage from
15 hr of labor, observational field notes, and five
postnatal video-cued interviews. CSS is a substudy of the larger birth unit design (BUD) study
conducted in hospital birth units in Australia
between 2011 and 2015. Both studies received
ethical approval (HREC/10/HAWKE/135 and
SSA/10/SG/190).
The CSS study was a focused, short-term ethnographic study that used thick description to
provide sufficient evidence and context for the
“reader to evaluate the extent and truth of the
phenomenon under investigation and how it may
resonate with other environments, circumstances,
and people (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)” (Harte et al.,
2016).
Video-ethnography is an ethnographic technique that uses video of the participants engaged
in the experience in question to observe complex
lived experiences (“the data”), which then
enables deeper reflection on the part of the participants and the researchers. In the CSS study, the
video-reflexive ethnographic data collection consisted of unobtrusive labor recording, followed by
postpartum interviews conducted while viewing
the footage, to explore the participants’ experiences and the meanings they attribute to their
experiences in the designed space. The participants were invited to view the video, being aware
of the researcher’s intention to activate a reflexive process.
In the CSS study, reflexivity was practiced in
two shared but different ways by the researcher
and by the participants. Reflexivity is a process
of stepping back from the data to view it with a
personal recognition as to one’s place in the
experience to enable the data to be interpreted
in a systematic and layered way (Darawsheh,
2014; Palaganas et al., 2017). The researcher
practiced a reflexive stance with an aim to gain
honest and open assessment of multiple aspects,
for instance, their personal station and values,
while the participants were also invited to practice a reflexive stance in the act of watching the
video—to interpret their actions based on
multiple aspects, for instance, their memories
and feelings as well as novel observations.
All CSS study participant names are pseudonyms. Felicity, the woman in labor, aimed for a
natural, unmedicated labor. Felicity’s mother,
Frances, acted as her main supporter for most of
the labor. Although Frances acted as Felicity’s
main supporter, Felicity’s partner, Martin, was
available as needed to provide support. Felicity’s
two sisters also occupied the birth environment
and provided support in varying (lesser) degrees.
Three midwives present at various points of the
labor provided contextual evidence to facilitate
ethnographic understanding.
Three themes were identified in the CSS
analysis: an “unbelonging paradox,” “role
navigation,” and “supporting the supporter”
(Harte et al., 2016). Eight subthemes characterize
these three themes as seen in Harte et al. (2016).
Design characteristics to facilitate optimal BUD
have previously been proposed in the BUDSET
(Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al., 2011;
Sheehy et al., 2011). We will now provide further
contextual background for BUDSET.
Case 2: BUDSET
An important research component that supported
the development of the CSS was the presence of a
physical birth spatial design audit tool, the BUDSET. The original BUDSET tool serves as the
second case for this comparative case study
report. Upon completion by birth unit caregivers,
staff, designers, or related people, the BUDSET
enables a valid and reliable audit of physical
childbirth environments in terms of the quality
of the built spaces, including the objects within
them, specifically from the perspective of a target
group of women’s experiences.
It may clarify the relationship between BUDSET and the CSS findings to picture the entire
birthing journey as both a series of physical
movements through physical space, as well as a
psychological journey outside of space (and time)
for the woman and her supporter(s). Optimally,
the woman and her chosen supporter synergize as
a cooperative dyad.
The BUDSET has four domains, which serve
to assess design factors contributing to the “fear
Harte et al. 151
cascade” cycle (Stenglin & Foureur, 2013),
including the attributes of “facility,” “aesthetics”
of the space, and “support” for family and friends
(Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010). These domains are
comprised of 18 characteristics—the design
principles.
Results of a pilot test indicate that the BUDSET is a viable tool for “assess[ing] the optimality of birth units... [and to] determine which
domain areas may need improvement” (Foureur
et al., 2011, p. 36). Other studies confirm content
validity for the original target group of women,
while proposing the opportunity for refinements
to better reflect the experiences of diverse groups,
midwives, and supporters (Menke et al., 2018;
Sheehy et al., 2011).
Comparative Case Study Methods
The research presented here uses the comparative
case study approach (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017), an
empirical approach to making extended meaning
of two or more cases. We present, framed with
theory, the relationship of the CSS findings as
compared with the BUDSET design recommendations. Similarly, the BUDSET is compared to
the CSS to demonstrate the relevance, applicability, and validity of the CSS study.
The strength of the comparative case study
method is the ability for the researcher to attend
to simultaneous and overlapping axes, as
described by Bartlett and Vavrus (2017). Specifically, the “horizontal, which compares how similar ... phenomena unfold in locations that are
connected and socially produced; vertical, which
traces phenomena across scales; and transversal,
which traces phenomena and cases across time”
(p. 15). It is important to understand the need for
context to not be solely defined “as place or location, but ...should rather be conceptualized as
something spatial and relational” (p. 15).
Additionally, the comparative case study
method “eschew(s) a static, bounded notion of
culture in favor of a view of culture as an
on-going, contested production” (Bartlett and
Vavrus, 2017, p. 15). This method supports the
extension of an existing spatial evaluation tool
via comparative superimposition of ethnographic
results. The comparative case study method as
promoted by Bartlett and Vavrus works in an
iterative way to trace relevant and contingent
actors, both human and nonhuman, to achieve
“a sense of shared place, purpose, or identity with
regard to the central phenomenon” (p. 10), which
in our case is the support of childbirth supporters
in the designed environment.
Analysis Process
As there are important design practice suggestions (also called design imperatives) revealed
by the CSS, so too design imperatives are also
included as the spine of the BUDSET. The comparative case study approach was conducted
using a line-by-line comparison of all CSS findings, as reported in Harte et al. (2016), overlayed
directly to each BUDSET characteristics. The
aim was to authenticate fit, utility, validity, reliability, rigor, and trustworthiness for both cases
(Miles et al., 2018), as meaningful to design scholars, childbirth design evidence-creation, and
design practitioners.
Because BUDSET was developed prior to the
CSS study, there is a gap we argue should be
addressed, to strengthen BUDSET by more completely including the needs of childbirth supporter(s). The BUDSET characteristics are evident in
the CSS findings, as the CSS findings also
demonstrate the relevance of the BUDSET characteristics. Each component of each data set
(BUDSET and CSS) was taken in turn and compared to each of the other set of components by
the first author and later verified as accurate by
the coauthors. Narrative examples of this process
follow in the Findings section.
The complete comparative case study is presented in Table S2 as a online supplementary file,
as a technique to demonstrate the iterative suggestions to better include supporters within the
existing BUDSET, Version 2.0. All 18 BUDSET
domains are stated, followed by CSS findings to
highlight supporters’ needs within the design as
related to the BUDSET characteristic. The degree
to which the BUDSET characteristics are
reflected within the CSS study are indicated as
either strong, mixed, or limited to the degree in
which the listed items were relevant and matched
to the CSS participants’ experience, either as
152 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1)
example or as counter example. For instance, if
the ability to adjust lights is a BUDSET characteristic, and this ability was absent but desired by
the CSS participants, it is listed as mixed.
The analysis highlights BUDSET aspects that
account for supporters, and areas where the CSS
suggests a need for development of supporters’
design-related needs. First, we provide contextual
information about BUDSET, followed by two
examples of how design elements participated
in the childbirth supporters’ experiences.
BUDSET Domains Related to Supporters
One further proviso, before describing examples,
is that a person’s perception of their experiences
is true for them, while—in the case of supporter’s—this self-perception may not transfer into
the most optimal behavior to facilitate labor. This
article aims to provide context for suggested
future and more nuanced research. A further
research question that could be posed is, do
design features play a mediating role, or do they
have a moderating role in clarifying supporters’
self-perceptions of their activities—while also
improving the actual supporter role?
As reported in the CSS (Harte et al., 2016),
supporters have two parallel sets of needs:
(1) to provide support for the woman and (2) (to
have assistance in) managing the physical and
emotional demands of their role. Implicated
within these two roles, which we call “engaged”
and “waiting,” although neither term is exclusive,
are both sets of supporter’s needs: to support the
woman and to be supported in attending to their
own well-being.
As reported in the CSS (Harte et al.,
2016), supporters have two parallel sets of

demands of their role.
With a finer grained comparative case lens, we
now examine BUDSET as reflected in the CSS
findings while the CSS findings are simultaneously assessed as reflected in the BUDSET characteristics. A few examples are identified to
demonstrate this relationship, with design
imperatives identified"
10.23750/abm.v94iS3.14283,Evaluation of stakeholder opinion about Long-Term Care facilities for people with dementia perceived quality: a web-based survey in the Italian context,2023,"Background and aim: Italy is a country where the percentage of the elderly population is very high (23% over 65). The investigation aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC). Methods: This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The questions were identified after exploring an analysis of recent European case studies. The survey has been submitted to a panel of stakeholders (us-ers, practitioners, designers, and managers in the healthcare sector). It is articulated in eight items touching on functional, configurational, and perceptual aspects of the LTC. Results: The 210 responses provided a basis for comparison with the trend lines detected by the case study analysis, establishing continuity on some con-figurational aspects and providing divergent views for others. The research found a strong need to introduce new service activities and technologies targeted at caring for and assisting guests with dementia. These specific requirements commonly require the development of new spaces and environments or the redefinition of the same, where already present. Conclusions: The results highlight that a new model of residence must incorpo-rate new technological applications, and outdoor spaces, that are perceived significantly by both patients and practitioners and therefore improve the well-being of all users.

World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1).
Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2).
This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,
 
learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD.
It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented
 

 

as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5).
In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6).
The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,
 

and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7).
Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns.
There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,
 


 

Figure 1. The comparison of the bed numbers of LTC between 2010 and 2020 (Eurostat).
 

 

that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14).
Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related.
In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).

1.1	Research gap

In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research.
There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have.
The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of
 

fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).

2.	Materials and methods

This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research.
The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users.
A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy.
The survey consists of:

1.	identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development)
2.	choice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition)
3.	processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)

The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare
 

 

facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.

2.1	Assessment framework development from the case study analysis

The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing
- thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).

2.2	Web-based survey definition

The survey was divided into 4 parts:

1.	The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only.
2.	The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.
 

3.	The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question.
Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD.
The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development:
-	location,
-	shared spaces,
-	paths,
-	living areas,
-	external spaces,
-	technologies,
-	bedrooms.
4.	In the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.

2.3. Data collection and analysis

The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible.
The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...).
It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer.
The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.

3.	Results

The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.

The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid.
The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined.
This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces.
Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.
 

3.1.	Section 1 – Statistical data

The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).

3.2.	Location

The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).
 
3.3.	General aspects

As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about
10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development.
However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.

Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
3.4.	Distribution

56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8).
It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.
 
3.5.	Living area

The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9).
Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,
 


 

Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.



Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.

3.6.	Outdoor space

The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,
 
such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.

3.7.	Future trends

Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a

Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.

 
prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11).
This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.
 
3.8.	Personalization

The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners.
In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a
 

 

viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.

3.9.	Other considerations

The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire.
These can be divided into three main themes:

A)	Issues related to the content:
-	I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff;
-	In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process;
-	Single room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside;
-	I believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”;
-	A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration;
-	Fundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important
 

to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife;
- I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community;
B)	Issues related to the form and process of the survey:
-	Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions;
-	Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities;
C)	Issues related to staff training and education:
-	All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself );
-	Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces;
-	It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and
 

 

chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.

3.10.	Comparison of the results

The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses.
Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,
 

favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).

4.	Discussion and conclusion

The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with
 




 

Figure 13. The comparison between the results from the Case studies and Questionnaire.
 

 

the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed.
The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.

5.	Research limitations and future developments

The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage
 

and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents.
However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

10.22712/susb.20230019,A Framework for implementing biophilic design in cancer healthcare spaces to enhance patients’ experience,2023,"Recently the demand for new Cancer healthcare Facilities has expanded, requiring a new design approach of spaces that prioritizes patients’ needs and faces their challenges, during treatment, patients lack interaction with nature. This issue is closely related to Biophilic Architecture, which promotes the incorporation of nature into building design for health and psychological benefits. So, this study aims to develop a framework for integrating Nature in cancer treatment buildings to improve patients’ space experience and thus their health outcomes, The study is based on data collected through an efficient literature search on cancer patients’ needs, related to the Biophilic design approaches and patterns in the built environment, site visits, on-site observations, and surveys. 77 attributes were extracted and used as a foundation for the survey conducted in case study areas to identify patients’ preferences. The analytical process of the survey results demonstrates the advantageous outcomes of “Nature in the Space” biophilic design implementations. Statistical analysis revealed the impact of each pattern on patient satisfaction and stress reduction, highlighting the most and least significant patterns. It was found that patients favor direct visual connection with nature aspects in waiting and chemotherapy areas. Finally, this paper recommends for decision-makers a prioritization framework for biophilic design interventions to improve the cancer healthcare space design to better meet patients’ needs and enhance their healthcare space experience. © International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.","With a focus on sustainable development, the goals and desired beneficial outcomes of asset rehabilitation are examined as a challenging process. Instead of building new cities, sustainable development aims to reclaim abandoned land. Buildings and the entire infrastructure are being renovated as a result of his growth, making the area more desirable as a location for investment or habitation [1, 2]. An urban heritage city core can be found at the heart of many cities all over the world. In addition to offering their communities significant social, cultural, and economic benefits, they provide them with an exceptional sense of place and identity. Urban sprawl, population growth, and other issues that could lead to the neglect or even destruction of historic sites and buildings, unfortunately, frequently cause serious issues in these areas. In order to ensure sustainable development for future generations while preserving our common cultural heritage, urban heritage city centre must be revitalized. A thorough strategy that involving numerous stakeholders is necessary to accomplish this. Many cities struggle to
 


 
finance significant projects due to limited resources and finances. Due to competing interests among various stakeholders, such initiatives frequently face a lack of political will or public support. Figure 1 show, that the greatest appreciation of heritage values improves all three dimensions of this interdisciplinary approach, enhancing quality of life in accordance with current requirements (synchronic). The conservation of growth plans for standard of living (syn-diachronic) and the realization of these historical values by future gene- rations (diachronic). In all three directions, this is accurate. Multimodal analysis may have a negative impact on the cultural of protected old urban sections or Heritage sites, leading to an overabundance of tourist attractions, employment losses, and a reduction in picture quality. Less intergenerational responsibility and little community participation will result from this. Unsustainable heritage management has an impact on the historic modal, which will eventually be destroyed in a proactive manner. It will also be negatively im- pacted by the loss of scientific knowledge, the sense of an unfriendly environment, environmental contami- nation, and the ineffective utilization of land and structures. Furthermore, restoring historical structures can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Despite these challenges, revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city cores is critical for achieving sustainable

development in communities. This not only helps to preserve the shared cultural heritage, but it also has economic benefits: by investing in historic building restoration, we create jobs and attract new businesses, which can increase tax revenues for local govern- ments. Additionally, preserving historic sites gives locals special places to explore and enjoy while fostering a sense of community pride. Urban redevelopment is initially defined by Roberts [3] as a complete and integrated vision that solves urban issues and aims to enhance the economic, social, and environmental circumstances of a place that has undergone trans- formation. The components of sustainable development could be classified to environmental, economic, and social; they contend that in reality, each component of sustainability is handled by a number of redevelop- ment objectives [4]. Furthermore, sustainability evaluations should make allowance for interdependencies, economic, environmental, and social challenges, along with the long-term effects of current actions [5]. However, because of a number of issues and the participation of several parties, redevelopment is highly complicated. It is a complex task, thus it is essential that dangers and difficulties are recognized right away. When an old structure reaches the end of its useful life, it needs to be renovated. Over time there is appreciation in land and depreciation in building structure while providing an example of determining the best moment for renovation [6]. Once the value of the land exceeds the worth of the structure, it is much more acceptable to redevelop the building. This view is supported by the fact that the majority of the structures in Hilla’s historic district actually exist. Older buildings in Hilla’s city center have a lifespan of 40 to 150 years (Figure 2), but land value with existing development limitation laws is significantly more than the present worth of those buildings and their use. Numerous buildings in the city’s historic district undergo renovations regardless of their age or longevity. Sustainable urban redeve-
 


 
lopment, which also acts as a policy agenda to improve social, environmental, and economic conditions, reduces the adverse effects of urban expansion [5]. The historic district of Hilla is expanding quickly. By increasing the value of the land, urban redevelopment activities, infrastructural growth, and rising land and construc- tion demand all support the gentrification tendency. Hilla’s heritage city centre is unique due to the fact that it is not very old and experiencing fast transformation. Hilla’s considerable past as well as its quick transition helps to establish its perception as a dynamic, energetic city with deeply embedded heritage values. Rapid progress does, however, entail consequences. One the one hand, Hilla centre is valued for its historical relevance and heritage values by businesspeople, visitors, and urban planners. On the other hand, it is apparent that despite the city’s fast expansion and the requirement for urban renewal, Hilla historical assets and distinguishing traits must be preserved. This paper purposes to demonstrate how, Hilla urban growth and constructed heritage pre- servation may coexist and cooperate to assist one another. Also, it will demonstrate how historical values’ economic potential might aid urban development. Heri- tage values might be fabricated or even built from

scratch in order to promote urban growth. Despite the fact that Iraq possesses several historical cities with worldwide historical significance, the Hilla is in the frontline of conservation. This kind of strategy may promote participation and awareness among stake- holders, communities, and decision-makers. Through sustainable urban redevelopment, which also helps developers and planners solve significant environmen- tal concerns, the idea of sustainability is being spread among architects, planners, and developers [4]. Sustai- nable development has been cited as requiring the preservation of cultural heritage. The utilizing the city’s history necessitates that the entire city and surrounding area be maintained in top condition, and not just each individual structure [7]. In order to achieve a balance between the past and present of significant urban areas, adjustments should be made to a city’s tangible and intangible aspects as part of the larger goal of historical conservation. As a case study, urban and building rehabilitation plans have not yet been significantly influenced by sustainability. Recent research has been done to improve the connection between sustainability and building or urban rehabilitation in worldwide practices. The rationale for conducting this study, As we have seen from the literature review, there is a real need to develop a new methodology. This methodology is essential for the formulation and selection of indicators to assess sustainability, with a composite framework approach [8]. The contribution of the study to the existing literature is the proposed approach offers a considerable advance in how heritage is appraised in connection to the overall objectives of urban sustainability. The finding of common indicators between urban development and heritage conservation may assist in anticipating issues, identifying priorities, and giving baseline knowledge to support more and better sustainable practices in urban redevelopment [9]. The conflict of forces to transform the city centre and its historical assets needs new strategies empha-
 


 
sizing the necessity of sustainable development in the old city centre. In other words, it must evaluate the current city centre, its historical relevance and values, as well as its application for the redevelopment purposes.

Research Question
The research question was developed to explore how to apply the redevelopment model inside urban historic sites as a step toward sustainability. The primary idea is that revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city center is critical for achieving sustainable development. This study aims to shed more light on the importance of preserving urban history and how to remove impediments to the advancement of the sustai- nability paradigm. There is a lack of studies and frameworks that can be successfully used in cities at the local level, prompting the research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating local sustainability indicators and encouraging the recons- truction of heritage urban districts?”


Review of Sustainable Development Models
Sustainable development is an evolving concept, and heritage is now recognized to have great potential in contributing to social, economic and environmental sustainability goals. Heritage conservation has improved quality of life and reduced carbon emissions [11]. The new urban agenda recognizes heritage as an important factor for urban sustainable development, but there is no general consensus on how to best approach and deal with it. Examining the current redevelopment models is one way to identify the key components of a strong model for assessing sustainability and comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of each model. For the strategic and operational evaluation of sustainable urban redevelopment, a number of methods and tools have
 
recently been developed, reporting through indicators [12]. These tools are well-liked because they can evaluate urban management performance and competitiveness in the context of sustainability goals [13]. Sustaina- bility analyses provide metrics for activity outcomes and a way to track them over time [14]. They also serve as investment recommendations. They make it possible to set the objectives and support the decision- making procedures. Since they frequently serve multiple functions, they are crucial in operational calculations for the planners, the administrators, the legislators, and the decision-makers.
A 2016 study found that the most effective method for assessing the objectivity of sustainable project and policy scopes is rating systems. There are few indicators of heritage status and little scholarly literature devoted to heritage [9]. A set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the potential contribution that heritage can make to sustainable development must be developed because of these factors [15]. Indicators of sustai- nability may be evaluated using a variety of techniques for creating sustainable redevelopment models [16]. Due to its inherent complexity and ambiguity, sustai- nable development is challenging to evaluate and quantify. To assist organize such complexity for the sake of information exchange and decision making, it is necessary to have a complete grasp of the linkages between diverse environmental, economic, and social variables [17-21]. The definition of sustainable develo- pment by [22], which strives to provide a systematic framework for developing indicators and information systems, is a key classic text in this area. The primary model types that may be used to create sustainable redevelopment models are combination models [23]. The problem with these approaches is that there is no connection between sustainability goals and sustainability indicators. Three fundamental conceptual frameworks are listed by [24] as being used by indicator initiatives in all throughout the world, which are 1) A framework
 


 
for measuring regional sustainability that centers on a long-term outlook for the area; 2) Short-term goal models that don’t attempt to satisfy the requirement to show relationships between indicator regions; 3) Models that emphasize performance assessment. These models’ flaws include their emphasis on Bottom level (Local community) without top level (Expertise). Model is unique in that it incorporates ideas like domains, system orientators, and capitals [25]. Five categories of models are described by [26]: domain, goal, sectoral, issue, and causal frameworks. These models’ flaw is that there is no link between Top and Bottom. Al-Alwani [8] created a methodology to help with local Middle Eastern municipal assessments of sustainability. The disadvantage in this model is focusing on the Top level more than Bottom level. Each of these models and methodologies in above has weaknesses.

Methodology
In order to investigate a unique and information rich case that was selected for the in-depth study, this work used a mixed qualitative approach.

inability performance will be created. For the investi- gation of a single case study, this model has been chosen. One instance may satisfy every need for eva- luating the theory, whether to confirm, refute, or expand it. The theory proposition can then be evaluated against the single case (Hilla) to see if it is true or whether another possibility is more pertinent. Data from single or numerous studies are often applied to theories rather than to populations, hence they might be used to support theories but not populations [27]. This research is qualitative and quantitative; weighting factors had been used to analyze the data obtained and focuses on the factors that have direct relevance to the approach to urban redevelopment. These significant determinants were developed based on the theoretical background that established the three major factors which are environmental, social and economic factors. Urban redevelopment is an integrated action that is emerging with the purposes to catch long-term answers to the problems of issues such as physical, social, economic and environmental by participation and coo- peration [28]. In this research a model composed of five key stages (Figure 3) was utilized to assess the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of the redevelopment project. One of the main advantages of this method is that it can be used as a tool for ranking indicators to confirm covered and ignored issues [29]. It raises the ability of indicators to be easier to recognize and to help transfer valuable infor- mation to decision makers [30]. However, the disad- vantage is that it is quite modest and does not collect some of the complex interrelationships between a diversity of the dimensions of sustainability [30].

Data Collection
Accurate data collection is essential for maintaining the integrity of research. By selecting the right data collection tools (Figure 4) and outlining how to use
 


 

 
Figure 4. Data collection tools.

them correctly, the likelihood of errors is reduced. A formal process for data collection is necessary to ensure that the data is precise and well-defined. This provides a basis for comparison and offers a suggestion of areas for improvement. In this research five techniques for gathering data were used and highlighted in the following subsections as follow:

Wide ranging review of literature
As a conceptual step, data was gathered from many sources, such as prior studies, official reports, and government papers, followed by a study of urban sus- tainability and a comparison of worldwide evaluation methodologies. This research started with a look at the literature on urban redevelopment as a concept, as well as a sustainability evaluation for urban regeneration initiatives. Various materials, including published gover- nment reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research reports, and items appearing on websites and in the media, were studied as part of the literature study. Furthermore, official and academic documents as well as statistical information regarding the case study regeneration have been analysed. Reviewing the available case study literature makes it clear that there is a lack of an all-encompassing policy of urban development that would direct laws in accordance with the demands of the contemporary socio-economic reality. Additionally, some of these rules and regulations can be at odds with the fresh redevelopment ideas. The literature review findings from the first stage were
 
synthesized to reveal the relevant indicator or criteria. It explains the concepts represented in the analysis and to formulate the requirements for developing the model. These criteria were further refined in the second and third stages conducted with number of experts from various backgrounds of the case study.

Field observation
Following the literature review, to gather infor- mation for the case-study analysis, a field investigation was carried out on-site. It’s crucial together data from various sources when performing a case-study analysis. Field observation is one of the best ways to achieve this. Field observation can offer important insights into how people interact with and experience the subject matter in real life after completing a literature review, which gives an overview of the available research on the subject. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct interviews and to make the surveys. During the site visits, researchers made observations in relation to sustainability. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct the interviews, to make the surveys, and to make their own observations in the area in relation to sustainability. The primary sources of data gathering for the study included interviews, questionnaires, and the researchers’ personal observations. The indicators to assess the case study were carried out using the data and information gathered during the field investigation. Taking pictures of buildings and observing the surroundings of the site, which may have an impact on building condition, are also included in this phase. Understanding the cons- truction of historical structures and the history of urban development is also necessary for the case study process.

Semi-structured interview
Using open-ended questions, a large number of
 


 
interviews were done to look at how locals and stake- holders saw the difficulties associated with urban redevelopment in a case study. In this case study, the local residents and the stakeholders which have know- ledge of urban redevelopment projects in their commu- nity participated in semi-structured interviews. Through these discussions, researchers were able to identify recurring themes regarding the difficulties encoun- tered when implementing such projects, including: a lack of resources; poor communication between the various parties involved; difficulty obtaining necessary permits; and resistance from existing residents due to concern over displacement or lifestyle changes brought on by new development plans. The public’s goals for tackling local urban concerns were elicited through the interview process. One of the most effective methods for acquiring information to comprehend certain app- roaches to urban change has shown to be conducting interviews. As a result, this article is based on a theoretical research, a geographical analysis, and anal- ytical talks with provincial councils, local authorities, architects, planners, decision makers (government officials), religious academics, local inhabitants, and regular visitors to the city. In a case study, twenty interviews were done.

Focus group
Discussions and consultation with a panel of experts resulted in the development of a list of local evaluation components. It takes expert advice to sort the criteria found during the literature review and stakeholder interview so that you can understand their local impor- tance. A panel of experts has been established from significant stakeholder groups, including academia, government, and industry. Together, this group evaluates potential paths for social, environmental, and economic growth while speculating on possible future occurrences and scenarios to depict them throughout the visioning stage. This study aims to offer a number of sustai-
 
nability measures. It was found through this focus group that the development technique was sufficient and the signals were reliable. The focus group method is used in this study in order to focus on problems and wishes connected to local sustainability as well as gathering qualitative information and perspectives from a group of people [31].

Questionnaire survey
On the basis of iterative questionnaire consultation with expert panels, Delphi is utilized to develop the proper weightings indicators. Panelists were (six experts from the city of Hilla four experts with academic qualifications and two with relevant experience) selected based on their record of publications in the fields of sustainability, urban regeneration, planning, and deve- lopment, as well as their standing in research and reputation on both the national and international levels. Those in the public sector such as planners, economic development and urban regeneration consultants as well as policymakers legislators, real estate developers, regeneration consultants, and others are all represented. After a sufficient level of consensus was attained by using a Delphi technique, the expert responses were gathered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from unimportant to highly important. Experts were given a thorough list of the indicators of redevelopment along with a questionnaire that ranked each indicator’s relative value on an important scale.

Case study
The researchers conducted case studies with the aim of completing a thorough investigation of the area to find and describe the phenomena and the essential elements [32]. Additionally, a thorough examination of a case study’s duration frequently forms part of the research design or, at the very least, requires the use of data. Additionally, by reproducing the correlated patterns, the consideration of multiple case studies contributes
 


 
to a more reliable result, enhancing the validity and robustness of the theory. Additionally, a three stage procedure is included. The new model was evaluated in a case study to guarantee its dependability. Vali- dating and testing the models before implementing them is a crucial step in ensuring the success of urban redevelopment initiatives. Teams can be sure that their models will function as expected once deployed in cities all over the world by utilizing these techniques during the development phase, such as running simula- tions based on real-world scenarios. Now that it is aware of this, it is able to anticipate even greater advancements made possible by novel solutions, like those offered by our recently tested framework. Veri- fication and testing are necessary for any urban redeve- lopment project to be successful. Teams can make sure that their plans will work in practical situations and produce the best results for citizens by taking the time to evaluate frameworks prior to implementation. The

final outcomes will be verified and tested by applying the framework to specific urban redevelopment initiatives.

Context
This study concentrated on Hilla, the provincial capital of Iraq’s Babel province, has a rich history and culture. Hilla, located on the banks of the Euphrates River, has long been an important trading and com- mercial center. Because of its archaeological sites and monuments, it has grown in popularity as a tourist destination in recent years. It is situated at 32.46 latitude and 44.42 longitude (Figure 5). The city of Hilla extends along the eastern and western banks of the Euphrates River. The city has an area of about (5243) hectares and a total population density of (63.71 people/ha). The part that is to be redeveloped in this paper consists of 2 residential neighborhoods. This city was chosen because it possesses traits common to many other Middle Eastern nations and contains a significant number of distinctive cultural heritages that have not yet been certified as cultural heritage struc- tures (Figure 6). Due to its close vicinity to the ancient city of Babylon, which has given the city a great relevance in terms of development potential, Hilla has a unique chance. Additionally, it is one of the major Iraqi cities, and its central business district is home to a large number of viable old buildings. The city has made a concerted effort to appreciate the value of and renovate this old building stock. The case study was also, chosen because it was thought that it may serve as a suitable illustration for the examination of local urban redevelopment strategies and serve as an example of the lessons that can be gained from local redeve- lopment initiatives.

Case Study application
The research started with literature reviews on urban
 


 
redevelopment concept and sustainability assessment for urban redevelopment projects. Numerous materials, including officially released reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research papers, articles from websites and media, have been examined. To gather data and information for the case study analysis, a field study had been carried out locally after the literature review. During the field research, several interviews were made with many stakeholders and local people living in the city.
The interviews and survey are consisted of ques- tions such as: What are problems and challenges in

your city? What are your wishes for redevelopment your city? How can your city be improved in your view? The focus group had been conducted and consists of expertise to build -up a list of indicators and the final form of the assessment model was achieved through Questionnaire survey (Delphi technique).

Problems Identification
This research study is focused on building a model for redevelopment assessment of old building with emphasis on sustainable redevelopment in old part in Hilla. The primary sources of data for the study were surveys, interviews, fieldwork, and the researchers’ personal observations in addition to analysis of the literature to determine the key difficulties or concerns of local sustainability in the city of Hilla, Iraq, as the chosen case study. The indicator-based evaluation of the case study was conducted using the data and information (Table 1) gathered during the field inves- tigation.

Build-up sustainable redevelopment Indicators
For efficient group discussions, it is advised that the size be between six and twelve [34]. Ten people were in the focus group for this case study. Each indication had been constructed using a logic process that was devised in cooperation with the experts from various

disciplines present at this focus group, and all concerns expressed were organized into their associated dimen- sions as shown in Figure 7.

Delphi technique
The Delphi approach was used to generate group agreement based on expert opinions when the intended redevelopment indicators were met [35]. Experts with comprehensive knowledge of linked topics and skilled specialists participated. The use of the multi-stage
 
tionnaire with an itemized rating system was used to rank indications on a priority basis, with forty experts participating in practice. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insig- nificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model

and provide more insight and information as needed after taking into account the previous experts’ replies at the focus group [36]. Two crucial rounds of the Delphi approach were used in this study: idea generation to help restrict the field or insight. Delphi searches for as much more information as it can simultaneously in order to educate and foster consensus by fusing a wide variety of expert viewpoints [37].

their understanding of various environmental factors, social and economic challenges, urban planning and design, and political concerns pertaining to urban regions. Following the first round of Delphi questionnaires, expert opinion showed that there was no extension of the original list of indicators and no modifications in the indicators found in the previous phase (focus group). They were then moved into the quantitative stage to determine their relative relevance. A ques-

Discussion of Results
The research establishes to address the main research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating sustainability indicators and encouraging the reconstruction of historic urban districts? In order to address this main research question, the research in this paper built a new methodology to develop suitable local sustainability indicators to facilitate assessment of local sustainability and verified the new methodology for its applicability in heritage part for city of Hilla as a case study. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insignificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model urban redeve- lopment indicators, which is shown in Figure 7
 
includes three main dimensions and 25 urban indi- cators that are prioritized. The indicator with the greatest priority is “Improved Infrastructure networks,” which is followed by “Reduce unemployment” indicator, “Encourage Employability” indicator, “Energy Distri- bution Network” indicator, “Energy efficiency” indicator, and “Modern Sanitation Facilities and Water Networks” indicator. The respondents ranked the conservation of water bodies as being more essential than reducing noise pollution, which had the lowest mean score and greatest sustainability. These results demonstrate that the model is founded on an awareness of the main problems and obstacles associated with local urban regeneration. According to Figure 7, these results may appear unexpected at first sight, but they are really common and expected, particularly in a nation like Iraq where several conflicts have contributed to poverty and instability. Participants also gave priority to these issues since Hilla struggles much in them and because they speak to the needs of the neighborhood. Analysis reveals that participation in heritage is the key element that has the greatest potential to lead to long-term sustainable development. Neighborhood residents were unable to take part in the consultation process due to the lack of formal structures, and many were unclear about the heritage policy. To effectively communicate protection, there needs to be a point of contact between the general public and the local government. By comparing the results obtained in the fieldwork with the theory in literature review, we can confirm that. The new methodology in this paper successfully collected related social, economic, environmental and institutional problems in the heritage part of the city of Hilla over the use of source document analysis, inter- views and focus groups"

Design/methodology/approach: This study was performed using a mixed method. Data collection was carried out through observational research and descriptive analysis in six primary health care facilities in Salvador and Lauro de Freitas, Brazil. Findings: Based on this study’s results, facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility have been considered the facilities’ main problems in the investigated context. The impact of the users’ perspective on healthcare facilities was assessed for each of these three criteria to verify the results obtained. Furthermore, most of the parameters were not satisfied, as the buildings analyzed had defects in their physical environment. Therefore, it is necessary to review and pay more attention to the architecture of these cities’ primary health care units. Originality/value: The present study addresses the architectural environment design in Brazil’s healthcare facilities, which still have gaps. Improving the physical space of a health center ensures that the approach used in this research also applies to other health centers in similar contexts. The awareness that space’s activities and configurations will change according to each territory examined will open up so many investigation worlds. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","The development of unsuitable health buildings results from an inappropriate briefing
between architects and builders, and even where the facilities are constructed correctly, they
are not properly used (Silva Santos, 2006). Furthermore, new health centers are often achieved
by adapting existing buildings that do not reflect the regulations. Consequently, the primary
health care facility’s physical space is inadequate to carry out the required healthcare
activity.
Improving the physical environment in health facilities is now considered a necessity. A
consolidated and generalized procedure is needed to ensure proper planning to help designers
to build appropriate and integrated facilities in various developing contexts, especially in
remote areas where healthcare problems are increasing due to the lack of medical assistance,
water, transport and electricity, to identify the possibilities in the area and above all the
problems to solve them rationally.
Planning a social health center requires a multidisciplinary approach to organize the
building over time effectively. The health facility should respond to the rapid changes and the

needs of both the medical staff and the population. Thus, the requirements of flexibility,
modularity, aggregation and reversibility become a key component to respond to the health
structure’s subsequent transformations. This paper on primary care centers addresses a gap
in the healthcare field by exploring the physical features of health units associated with
favorable user outcomes (Gulwadi et al., 2009).
A study was carried out on the architectural configuration of some health centers in the
Metropolitan Area of Salvador (RMS), Bahia state in Brazil, according to a mixed method to
improve basic health facilities’ physical environment. The research aims to verify the state
and the work carried out now on health centers and define design strategies to improve the
architectural space.
2. Theoretical framework
Previously, several studies have been done to investigate the current state of quality in
healthcare architecture. For example, usability is one of the evaluations that assess quality-inuse. It is measured by three parameters: the effectiveness and efficiency of the design or
facilities offered and the user’s satisfaction (Harun et al., 2011). Ariadne Labs has created
guidelines for designers and facilities under construction to design in the healthcare sector
focused on childbirth, explaining, for example, how the quality of the environment and
especially three factors such as capacity, workload and motivation affect the decision to
perform a cesarean delivery (Ariadne Labs, 2017). Another study shows factors influencing
spatial layouts in healthcare buildings, such as safety and well-being, user satisfaction,
organizational and technological adaptability to future changes, spatial configuration,
energy, and environment (Zhao et al., 2009). The same authors Zhao and Mourshed explored
in a newer article the patients’ perspectives on the design of hospital outpatient areas. Their
research evaluated outpatients’ perspectives of the space of the waiting area by investigating
their opinion on a range of hospital design indicators and reflecting on the building design
process (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Additionally, the results of another study, functional
efficiency, user satisfaction, environmental issues, patient safety and flexibility were
considered the main problems in the physical environment of healthcare facilities. Issues such
as user satisfaction, patient safety and accountability in incidents have often been
investigated in terms of management strategies, quality of medical and nursing services, and
medical equipment facilities; instead, the role of architecture in improving the mentioned
factors has gone unnoticed (Ebrahimi et al., 2013).
For this reason, starting from the literature review, the design elements that influence the
quality-in-use of the architectural space have been analyzed under three main aspects:
(1) Capacity of the structure and adaptability to changes;
(2) Functional efficiency and
(3) Accessibility and circulation of external and internal spaces.
These three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate testable
hypotheses verified by users’ perspectives based on an extensive review of the literature and
through direct observation on-site visits.
3. Background
The Alma-Ata Declaration (1978) remains a pivotal document in global health history, setting
a standard of public commitment to make community-led quality healthcare accessible to all,
physically and financially. This was the forerunner of the Global Strategy for Health for All
by the Year 2000, pursued by WHO and its partners for the rest of the twentieth century, and
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: “Ensuring lives healthy and promote well-being for
all at all ages” by 2030.

Health-related SDGs can only be achieved sustainably with a greater emphasis on
primary health care. Therefore, renewing primary health care and placing it at the center of
efforts to improve health and well-being is essential to respond to a complex and rapidly
changing world (World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), 2018). Consequently, it is necessary to rethink the design and construction of new
primary health care facilities and the adaptation of existing ones, particularly the decisionmaking process during the initial stages. Decisions regarding physical characteristics such as
layout design and shape are made early and are difficult to change or reverse later without
significant financial commitments (Zhao et al., 2009).
Because walls are expensive to erect, floor plans of healthcare facilities do not usually
change much in the short term. However, as healthcare systems evolve, clinical environments
have changing needs, and spaces within the building can frequently change every two to
three years. Nevertheless, even when changes are expected, contingency planning and health
projects are rarely informed by empirical evidence of what works and what does not.
Consequences of limited testing include the propagation of low architectural value projects,
costly and potentially harmful to patients (Ariadne Labs, 2017).
Few researchers found that the project draws on previously acquired knowledge, insights
and beliefs derived from decision-making experience. Most of the design related to healthcare
environments is adopted and adapted without knowing if users are satisfied. Despite this lack
of knowledge, a healthcare center should meet people’s needs and achieve balance in the
outcome. Therefore, there is a relationship between the satisfaction of a facility by the user
and a coherent design of the architectural space that brings patients a positive experience and
greater liveability of the healthcare facility (Asfour, 2020). Spatial boundaries also influence
the user’s use of space by the physical and attractive environment (Harun et al., 2011).
In the existing literature relating to the user experience with the healthcare environment,
only a small number of participatory studies focus on spatial design aspects. Most of the
studies concern the quality of service and user satisfaction of the physical environment and
systems, rather than focusing on the user perspectives associated with the design factors of
the built environment in healthcare. However, the perceptions and expectations of patients
and clients are strongly linked to the use of space in the design of healthcare buildings.
Nevertheless, the design factors of healthcare facilities should be better integrated into the
design phase, which has remained largely neglected (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Therefore, it
is also necessary to consider the architectural environment and focus the attention on spatial
design to relate users with space.
Previous studies have shown that good space design reflects health, emotion, reduction of
stress and frustration for the visitor, functional efficiency, visitor accessibility, safety, patient
empowerment and cognitive abilities in spatial understanding (Harun et al., 2011). One of the
factors that influence the end users is designing the space’s layout, which is considered as one of
the main activities in the architectural project, both in new construction and building
adaptation. The layout design involves locating activity spaces or objects in a container space
to maximize or minimize design goals while meeting the required spatial relationships between
component spaces or objects (Ezzeldin et al., 2021). Designing primary health care buildings’
spaces requires special attention due to the close and complicated relationships between space
and function (Zhao et al., 2009). However, little research has been done on the space layout of
primary health buildings. The research reported here investigates the factors that influence the
design of space layouts in healthcare buildings taking into account the perspective of users.
3.1 Primary health care system in Brazil
Since the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, whose purpose was to achieve “Health for All,” Brazil
has implemented the Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Sa  ude [SUS]) and organized 
Improving
physical space

facilities

health services. It also defined primary health care as a gateway and the main strategy to
accomplish the goal and promote health, prevention through universality, integrity and
equity. However, primary health care in Brazil is characterized by problems of the facilities’
physical environment (Facchini et al., 2006).
The Ministry of Health in 1994 implements primary health care with the Family Health
Strategy to reorganize basic care in the SUS. The Family Health Team implements this
strategy, a multi-professional team that assists the families within the Basic Health Unit,
responsible for a specific number of families in a defined geographical area (Marqui et al.,
2010). There can be a maximum of five Family Health Teams in each health center to have
greater population coverage. It is recommended that each team be responsible for between
600 and 1,000 families (2,400 to 4,500 inhabitants), with an average of 3,000 people (Escorel
et al., 2007).
The Ministerial Decree No. 2,226/2009 establishes the National Plan for the
Implementation of Basic Health Units for Family Health Teams to guide professionals and
municipal health managers in designing, planning projects for the construction and extension
of primary health units. The tool has 15 activities (Figure 1): reception, waiting area, medical
record room, meeting room, health agent room, medical office, procedure room, vaccination
room, collection room, nebulization room, curative room, dental office, brushing room,
compressor and pump area and sterilization room. The area of these spaces and the activities
can also be extended according to the local needs and the activities planned, such as
administration or management room, warehouse and pharmacy (Ministerio da Saude, 2009  ).
Although Brazil has not achieved the “Health for All by the Year 2000” target, it has made
significant progress, even though the Brazilian National Health System does not work at full
capacity.
Previous studies conducted in some Bahia municipalities, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato
Grosso have shown deficiencies in the physical structure. “Multicenter survey conducted in
seven Brazilian states showed the architectural deficits of these health units, for 59.8% of the
units were classified as inadequate, as for their infrastructure” (Gomes et al., 2015).

Given the Family Health Team’s interdisciplinary nature, the use of physical spaces must
be thought of in a new way, allowing their use in a shared way between different
professionals and activities at different times. Functional requirements change. The change
can take place in different time cycles (short, medium and long term) and at various levels:
from the replacement of the equipment to the renewal and expansion of the medical offices, to
the complete change in the use of the spaces, to the expansion of the structure. The change can
occur either because some parts become obsolete or because of a change in medical practices
or the organizational patterns of activities. The key to a health center being able to manage
change is to use flexible buildings effectively (Kendall, 2012). “The next generation of health
care buildings for the primary sector will be flexible long-life buildings, based on a
comprehensive briefing document where design quality plays a major part in establishing the
design philosophy” (Purves, 2002, p. 23).
4. Methodology
This study applies a mixed-method approach that combines and integrates observational
research and the descriptive analysis of six different primary health care facilities (USFs)
design. The research was conducted on-site between May and October 2016 in the north-east
of Brazil, in the state of Bahia, and precisely in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador
characterized by a high index of urbanization and population density compared to the rest of
the state and brings together large urban centers with diversified and specialized functions. It
includes 13 municipalities, such as Salvador and the neighboring Lauro de Freitas, which are
the subjects of this research.
According to a territorial analysis (detailed in the following paragraph), the researcher
selected several primary health units to maximize the diversity of facilities. The design
elements measured in this study have been identified based on the literature review carried
out so far. These elements have been further refined and adapted to the reference context.
Therefore, from the literature review focusing on the impact of design on healthcare
environments, the design elements that could affect the architectural space were analyzed
under three aspects: facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility (Table 1).
The three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate verifiable
hypotheses. The health outcomes of each of these three criteria were analyzed through a
Table 1.

cross-sectional analysis through the experience and perception of users derived from the
existing literature review and the direct observation during site visits. This allowed to
strengthen the subjective experience of the user and not to focus the results obtained on the
functionality of the building in terms of administration and healthcare delivery as a service.
User satisfaction connects the perception and experience of spaces with the architectural
design of the health facilities. The purpose and the use of the spaces were confirmed by on-site
visits with sketches and photographs, users’ observations and facility managers’ interviews.
The researcher requested the floor plans for the selected facilities. Floor plans were
redesigned as needed using design software to identify and count rooms by type and measure
key distances and spaces. Further reasoning was made to interpret these results to generate
specific hypotheses on how the design can influence physical space design through the user’s
experience. The project posed no risk to users, and site visits were authorized by the clinical
director of each facility visited.
4.1 Facility selection
The selection of six primary health units has enabled the acquisition of a wide range of
facilities in different districts. To identify candidate facilities, a study of Salvador and Lauro
de Freitas’s territory was carried out considering their division into health districts rather
than administrative ones. Of all the RMS cities, Salvador is the most important, as it is the
capital of the State of Bahia, with about 2,886,698 inhabitants (IBGE, 2020) and occupies a
territorial extension of 693,453 km2 (2019). Its political and administrative organization
includes 18 administrative regions and 12 health districts. Instead, Lauro de Freitas has an
estimated population of 201,635 (IBGE, 2020) with a land area of 58,143 km2 (2019) and is
divided into 19 administrative districts and 7 health districts.
The six units’ selection criteria were based on a territorial study based on the distribution
of five types of development in the analyzed territory: low, medium-low, medium, mediumhigh and high (Figure 2). The health centers (USF) were then superimposed on the
development zones map (Carvalho and Silva, 2009).
Figure 2.

The analysis shows that the primary health care facilities partially uncover part of the
eastern coast along the Atlantic Ocean. This area is mainly composed of high-income
populations that mainly benefit from private services, without recourse to the aid with low
efficiency characterized by long waiting time. On the other hand, the disadvantaged areas are
found in the central area and on the internal coast of Bay of All Saints (Baıa de Todos os Santos),
where a greater concentration of primary health care units emerges to help deprived people.
To have a different range of health facilities, three units in the less developed health
district (Suburbio Ferrovi  ario) and a health unit in a developed area (Itapu~a) located along the
coast of the Atlantic Ocean were selected for the municipality of Salvador.
While in Lauro de Freitas, two health units have been selected, one in the northern
marginal district (Areia Branca) and the other in a developed area along the coast (Ipitanga).
In the peripheral area of the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador, the health facilities of Unidade
de Saude da Fam  ılia (USF) Alto de Coutos, USF Alto de Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha
were analyzed, instead in the high development area of the Itapu~a, the USF Mussurunga was
selected. In Lauro de Freitas, the USF Parque S~ao Paulo in the marginal district of Areia
Branca and the USF Vila Praiana in the developed area of Ipitanga were considered for
the study.
5. Design data collection
The data collection was structured in three parts: site visits, interviews and facility profile.
5.1 Site visits
The researcher conducted site visits at the six selected units (Figure 3) to capture a wide range
of facility types in the different development zones. During each visit, the researcher met with
Figure 3.

the facility’s representatives, including clinical directors, nursing managers and operations
managers. The researcher organized a structured site visit guide to provide a standardized
organization at each visit and ensure that all research questions were discussed with each
facility team. Each site visit lasted approximately three hours, including an introductory
conversation to understand the building and facility’s history, a facility tour following the
patient’s pathway through the center.
5.2 Interviews
The most important findings identified during the site visits and which had not been
captured through floor plans were identified, including descriptive details on how specific
design elements influenced care. Based on these results, on-site interviews were carried out,
trying to cover as much information as possible in a period of about half an hour. The
interviews were conducted with the team present in the building during the visit, involving
the facility’s representatives (clinical directors, nursing managers and operations managers).
Facility managers were interviewed as they are aware of user feedback and experiences. The
facility manager’s task is to improve the environment, people, spatial relationships,
functional, environmental and economic aspects (Harun et al., 2011). The interviewer took
notes to use in the data analysis. Like site visits, information from interviews increased the
data accessed from floor plan analysis and improved understanding of relevant issues and
assumptions about how design affects care. Furthermore, during the on-site visits, walking
through accessible public spaces, waiting rooms and waiting corridors, it was observed how
users use and perceive the health center’s space and activities. This method is used to learn
about the intended uses, new uses and misuses of design.
5.3 Facility profiles
To collect the data, each health unit was personally visited by the researcher and evaluated
through direct observation and the application of structured tables divided into the three
criteria mentioned above useful for the analysis. To complete the table about the health
center’s general data, especially the year of construction, the number of employees, the
Family Health Team, and the patients per day, it was necessary to consult the facility
manager. During the tour, the researcher sketched the relevant aspects of the health center for
later analysis, such as representing the accessibility of the structure of USF Alto de Coutos II
or the waiting area of USF Parque S~ao Paulo (Figure 4). Sketches of the floor plans (Figure 5)
define the spaces’ dimensions and the activities’ subdivision, useful for filling the table’s
functional efficiency. The researcher photographed key areas (Plate 1) to verify the physical
Figure 4.

aspects and the quality of the spaces surveyed to compare them with the acquired plans.
Subsequently, the researcher was authorized to collect the selected health centers’ digital
plans in the prefecture. The acquired plans were updated and implemented following the
changes in the activities identified by the researcher during the inspection. The floor plans
were traced using an architectural drawing software (Figure 6) to equalize measures for
comparison across facilities’ measured areas (square meters), distances (meters) and units
(number) using built-in computer-aided design software tools.
6. Results
The comparative analysis between the case studies is summarized in the tables
corresponding to the three criteria identified. Facility capacity, functional efficiency and
space accessibility have been considered the facilities’ main problems in the investigated
context. To verify the results obtained by the three criteria, the patients’ perspective was
considered to assess their satisfaction in relation to the architecture design.

6.1 Facility capacity
The first criterion focuses on the healthcare facility’s capacity, as the size of the spaces and
their adequacy, the flexibility of the facility to possible future changes. The collected data
were compared in Table 2 and analyzed according to the three aspects: flexibility in design,

multifunction activities in an area and expandability of spaces in addition to general data
such as the year of construction, days and hours of the opening, which only serve to give a
general picture of the facilities.
(1) Adaptability in design. From the site visit and the data compared in the table, it can be
seen how three of the six structures analyzed are not built to be primary health units;
USF Vila Praiana and USF Parque S~ao Paulo are examples. Both are residential villas
that were later adapted to the health function. It was found that most of the primary
health care centers of Salvador and Lauro de Freitas are existing structures born as
living spaces unsuitable for the health facility. As a private space, the house is
unsuitable to the health function because often the residential spaces do not respect
the minimum size provided by the Ministerial Decree. An example is the USF Vila
Praiana, with limited waiting spaces and small corridors that do not adequately allow
users to circulate. Converting residential spaces with healthcare functions involves an
inadequate distribution of activities and a difficult distribution of flows between
doctors and patients.
In addition to these USFs derived from existing buildings, there are also primary
health care units considered as “model” health facilities, such as USF Alto de Coutos II
in Salvador. Visiting this health center, it was possible to perceive that this building
was built to be a health center respecting a clear functional organization of spaces
following regulations and legislation.
(2) Expandability of spaces. The buildings, even those built to be health centers, were not
planned to be enlarged in the future. However, the on-site surveys noted the possibility
of some buildings being expanded by occupying the nearby parking lot or garden.
However, this would entail high costs as the structure was not designed in a modular
way or was not designed to expand in the future. For example, in the USF Alto da
Terezinha, it is evident that inner space is reduced, and the structure needs to be
enlarged to accommodate new medical offices. Therefore, it is clear how the structure,
despite being newly built, is not very flexible.
(3) Facility size. From the observational research on-site and the analysis carried out,
activities that do not comply with the minimum dimensions provided for by the
Ministerial Decree 2.226/09 are noted. The houses adapted to health centers have
dimensions that are not quite adequate to perform the health function. The overall
area of a building can be considered an upstream measure that affects many other
functional areas, the quality of circulation and staff support spaces’ capacity. The
positive thing is that this has allowed us to begin to have internal flexibility of the
spaces, such as the meeting room that has both an educational and refreshment
function in the USF Alto da Terezinha, or some clinics are shared by different doctors
on rotation to carry out the various activities. However, the small size of some rooms
also limits their potential usability and space flexibility.
To verify the results obtained on the capacity of the building, the perception of users was
considered through some main factors listed in Table 3, as there is a strong interest in the
patient-centered design of healthcare facilities by integrating the perception of users with the
physical environment.
Evidence from the literature review indicate that users expect more from the healthcare
environment in addition to a high-quality health service, such as appropriate and defined waiting
area, suitable space for families to wait, adequate number of seats, seating comfort, entertainment
facilities, appropriate and proportionate spaces to be used by staff and users, spaciousness

and respect for user privacy (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Reiling et al., 2008; Fausto et al., 2017;
Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). The direct observation of users during on-site visits, such as their
experience of inaccessibility of the spaces with reduced dimensions of the healthcare facility
environments, confirmed how these factors affect the outcome of the facility’s capacity.
Furthermore, the existing literature suggests that the number of visits of the users to the health
facility has influenced their perspectives on spatial and seating aspects (Zhao and Mourshed,
2017). The crowded waiting room and corridors make users uncomfortable with the surrounding
environment; this factor is one of the most important in the patient’s perspectives, and deserves
more attention in the design process. Therefore, the facility design can have a direct impact on
users’ satisfaction, a patient’s stress experience and organizational performance metrics (Reiling
et al., 2008).
6.2 Functional efficiency
According to the on-site analysis and comparing the six healthcare facilities, a key issue of the
physical environment considered in the research was the functional efficiency, including
nonfunctioning supplies and the distribution of functions present in health facilities (Table 4).
(1) Broken furniture. From the comparative analysis described in Table 4, it is observed
that some spaces are closed to the public due to faulty or malfunctioning equipment.
For example, the main problems related to the closure of some doctors’ offices are
listed below.
 USF Alto de Coutos II, the curative room’s air conditioning is malfunctioning, so
the room has been closed. The door and the window of the sterilization room do not
follow the regulations.
 USF Alto de Coutos, one of the dental offices, is closed due to a medical
equipment’s malfunction.
 USF Alto da Terezinha has several problems, including one of the rooms dedicated
to dentists is closed due to the medical equipment’s malfunction. The curative
room is closed due to the air conditioning’s malfunction, and the sterilization room
has broken equipment (autoclave). Therefore, there is a lack of maintenance in
various structures to have an efficient functionality of the spaces.
(2) Recognizable functional units. The medical offices do not have a specific name from
the information collected, but they are also subdivided into nursing and doctor office.
Functional units are not always recognizable. Signs indicate that various rooms in the
structures are designed to be health facilities but without specifying the exact activity.
Also, outside the doors of each clinic room, there is a sign with the words Clinic 01,
Clinic 02, Clinic 03, etc. but the internal function is not clear. This does not facilitate the
user in identifying spaces within the structure.

capacity criteria

(3) Zoning of health facilities space. From the analysis of the researcher’s drawings, such
as the diagrams shown below, we can see the different distribution of the plans and
activities between USF Alto De Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha (Figure 7).
The USF Alto De Coutos II is represented in the first exploded view diagram on the left of
Figure 7. It is considered a model health center. The health function activities are distributed
on a single floor, on the ground level. Additional space in the basement with the auditorium
function is intended for the staff of the health facility. Therefore, the specific activities are
distributed along the corridor’s sides, divided according to the four general activities
mentioned above (administrative area, clinical area, dental care and logistic support).
The second diagram instead highlights the USF Alto da Terezinha consisting of two
floors. Healthcare activities are distributed on both floors but present problems in terms of
accessibility and usability of the paths due to the lack of an elevator that would facilitate
access for disabled people or patients in difficulty reaching the second floor where the
activities are distributed for clinical care. The difficulty of using the space is also noted in the
USF Mussurunga and the USF Vila Praiana.

According to the users’ perspective in the literature review, some basic problems of the
physical environment were considered from the point of view of functional efficiency
(Table 5), including the use of space and the building, a thermally comfortable environment,
the wide gap between spaces with functional capacity and the scarce use of information
technology as a communication tool. The problem of distance, orientation and dislocation of
services on several levels will cause the patient tired, especially for the disabled and the
elderly. Furthermore, users consider cleanliness, air freshness, noise and thermal comfort as
important to their experience in healthcare facilities. Efficiency does not take too long to fix,
as it is easily accessible (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017).
6.3 Space accessibility
The third criterion, space accessibility, has been analyzed in Table 6 under the aspect of
urban accessibility, the presence of parking lots, the analysis of the external spaces and
internal evaluations of the structure.

(1) Urban accessibility. One of the problems identified during the site visits, especially in
the marginal districts, concerns the accessibility of the facilities. Roads in
underdeveloped districts, such as the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador and the
Areia Branca in Lauro de Freitas, have roads that are not very accessible, such as the
USF Parque S~ao Paulo, which has no paved roads. Furthermore, it is not simple to
find the health center’s location because it is not indicated precisely on the map. Or the
USF Alto de Coutos is difficult to access in case of rain, becoming a torrential road.
The two structures located in the districts along the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore in
the developed area, have good accessibility.
(2) Parking area. Among the public spaces, the parking is undesirable, lacking enough
parking lots in the disadvantaged health districts. Therefore, besides being not very
accessible, these structures are difficult to access due to the lack of parking spaces or
parking lots closed or open only to healthcare staff.
(3) Landscaping area and external spaces. The external areas are not present in the
analyzed structures, and where present, they are poorly maintained. An example is
the USF Parque S~ao Paulo, where the garden is used as a parking lot rather than a
social space for users. Or the garden of the USF Vila Praiana, which is dangerous, as
being a residential villa adapted to the health function, has an abandoned swimming
pool without protection and the risk of falling. A focus on outdoor public spaces
should, therefore, be considered.
(4) Path circulation and waiting areas in inner spaces. The waiting areas are not always
of adequate size for the facility’s capacity, as in the USF Alto de Coutos, where the
waiting area is disproportionate to the number of activities. Furthermore, the waiting
areas are not always located inside the structure but they are located outside (USF
Parque S~ao Paulo and USF Vila Praiana) due to lack of space. There are no waiting

areas near the medical offices and rooms. However, corridors are still used, which
sometimes not having adequate dimensions have limited spaces to perform the
distribution function, as in existing structures (USF Alto de Coutos, USF Parque S~ao
Paulo and USF Praiana) where the corridors have insufficient space to be walked
especially by a patient who walks with difficulty.
USF Alto da Terezinha was an example to analyze the path circulation within the facility
(Figure 8). The plan was redesigned, and the activities were distributed based on the
information gathered during the inspection. In the service spaces (corridors), the main paths
have been drawn divided between patients/visitors and medical staff (doctors, nurses and
public employees). However, what emerges from the analysis is a mixed path of users without
differentiation between the two categories. A first suggestion would be to dedicate the entire
upper floor to logistic and administrative activities that are restricted access areas and used
by doctors, nurses and officials to bring the care activities only to the lower floor to ensure
greater accessibility to the patients.
Space accessibility means how it is easy for users to reach the health facility or the interior
space to get the services they need. Accessing or having a view of the internal and external
landscape is one of the key factors of the users’ perception. Another important factor related
to the user’s emotional comfort is the absence of openings capable of viewing the outside of
the building and the surrounding landscape, especially in the waiting areas where the patient
spends time before being allowed to access the medical offices (Table 7).

The windows in the waiting room would increase the user’s social comfort by integrating
the environment with natural light. Furthermore, data from the literature review indicates
that exposure to light is a key factor to the health and well-being of users in healthcare
environments. However, considering the excessive daylight in the Brazilian context, it can
also cause visual discomfort. A large window could let in more daylight while consuming
more energy for heating or cooling at the same time. Therefore, artificial light should be
adequately balanced with natural light to achieve good thermal and social comfort (Ebrahimi
et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017).
7. Conclusion and implications of the study
The awareness that primary health care is gaining importance is increasing in different parts
of the world, including in Brazil, whose situation is reinforced by numerous studies that
address accessibility to primary health care, or strategic plans to improve the Family Health
Team, or studies on the accessibility of structures and so on. The search for guidelines
oriented toward primary health care architecture, in line with SUS’s principles, is one of the
great challenges that the Brazilian healthcare system still faces. The primary health units
must satisfy the users and respect the Ministry of Health’s physical and human structure
standards. However, in this study, albeit limited to a specific area, the data show that
Salvador and Lauro de Freitas’s cities do not offer users a service that reaches the ideal
standards in its facility, in most health units inspected.
There is a need for better control of the health sector, as the inadequacy of a primary health
care unit’s physical structure directly affects the quality of the community’s service.
The topic investigated is important for medical and nursing staff since professionals who
have greater contact with the population and their actions depend directly on the unit’s
infrastructure to improve healthcare and, consequently, obtain better health results.
The results of the work are part of the tools to support the concept of primary health care
centers; the research outlined in this paper has highlighted the importance of some aspects of
designing healthcare facilities, such as the capacity, the functional efficiency and the spatial
accessibility of the primary health care facilities. Integrating the results of these three criteria
with users’ perspectives to the architectural project was crucial. The research considered the
users’ perspective based on data from the literature review and on-site visits to healthcare
facilities. The perspectives of the users confirm the expected results of the three criteria
analyzed, influencing the health outcomes. A consistent result of this analysis is users’
preference for an environment that offered quality and comfortable space, rather than a place
that only addresses the functionality of the building. This result confirms the inadequacy of
converting residential buildings to healthcare facilities as they require a space of appropriate
size. Furthermore, users have shown interest in a comfortable healthcare environment with
good signage and technological information tools and better zoning of the space with adequate
distribution of medical offices and greater accessibility and usability of the facility. Another
aspect considered fundamental by users is their emotional comfort through openings in the
waiting room that allow the relationship between the internal and external landscape, and this
is a fundamental aspect that should be integrated into the six health centers analyzed and
extended to the other health facilities. The main factors expected by users confirmed the data of
the three criteria used to interpret the results and verify hypotheses. Therefore, user satisfaction
has a strong impact on the design process of health centers. Particular attention was paid to the
spaces created in the healthcare sector, favoring an improvement in the physical space
configurations, which must be considered a space of comfort and well-being, sensitive to social
needs and ensuring the spaces’ flexibility. Therefore, it is not enough to have sufficient
resources to build health facilities if one does not care to guarantee the correct configuration of
spaces and maintenance of these physical spaces.

The present study aims to guide municipal health professionals and managers in the
planning, programming and building of basic health units taking into consideration the users’
perspective. The planning strategies, born from theoretical studies and the analysis and
evaluations of case studies located in Brazil, are applicable for designing new primary health
care centers in similar areas. The suggested spaces should adapt to the local reality that activities
will change according to each territory examined and open up so many investigation worlds.
Defining the primary health care facilities’ characteristics is not easy due to the higher
incidence of prevention and the consequent increase in outpatient areas. Despite the
standardization of the design choices and functional grouping, the overall composition of
future structures’ design will meet the flexibility requirements both in the design and
operational phases. Therefore, it is even more important that healthcare facilities built in the
future are designed to flexibly meet changing needs, including those that can be anticipated
and those that cannot even be imagined.
It is worth recalling that the analysis made up to now highlights the importance and
potentiality of the architectural space and its configuration, that is, the order of the spatial
relationships the building consists of. These configuration aspects acquire a significant role
in the healthcare center when they relate to functional and organizational relationships based
on the architectural project. Space analysis allows us to visualize it as potentially occupied by
user groups. In architectural composition, the relationship between user and architect is very
close and contributes to creating the physical environment.
This study has fielded fundamental reflections on strategies related to the design of the
first-level health architectural space, considering the perspectives of users on health
outcomes. It can be seen as a challenge that should be assimilated into the routine
configuration of health structures by professionals and health teams. Only in this way will a
new space of action for architects be opened, essential to the healthcare building’s full
development in its heal and care mission. Combining evidence-based design with
improvements to spatial design processes and the user experience and perception of the
building design will provide thoughtful reflection and guidance for clinical architect
collaborators who intend to build functional, flexible and quality environments"
10.1177/19375867221137099,Making Space for Midwifery in a Hospital: Exploring the Built Birth Environment of Canada’s First Alongside Midwifery Unit,2023,"Background: Canada’s first alongside midwifery unit (AMU) was intentionally informed by evidence-based birth environment design principals, building on the growing evidence that the built environment can shape experiences, satisfaction, and birth outcomes. Objectives: To assess the impact of the built environment of the AMU for both service users and midwives. This study aimed to explore the meanings that individuals attribute to the built environment and how the built environment impacted people’s experiences. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study using a grounded theory methodology for data collection and analysis. Our research question and data collection tools were underpinned by a sociospatial conceptual approach. All midwives and all those who received midwifery care at the unit were eligible to participate. Data were collected through a structured online survey, interviews, and focus group. Results: Fifty-nine participants completed the survey, and interviews or focus group were completed with 28 service users and 14 midwives. Our findings demonstrate high levels of satisfaction with the birth environment. We developed a theoretical model, where “making space” for midwifery in the hospital contributed to positive birth experiences and overall satisfaction with the built environment. The core elements of this model include creating domestic space in an institutional setting, shifting the technological approach, and shared ownership of the unit. Conclusions: Our model for creating, shifting, and sharing as a way to make space for midwifery can serve as a template for how intentional design can be used to promote favorable outcomes and user satisfaction. © The Author(s) 2022.","Canada’s first alongside midwifery unit (AMU)
opened in Markham Stouffville Hospital,
Ontario, in July 2018. The AMU is a physically
separate birthing unit governed and staffed by
midwives. The unit is in close proximity to the
labor and delivery (L&D) unit, so that in the event
of an emergency, patients can be easily moved.
For more detail on the setup and function of the
AMU, see Cameron et al. (2019). The design of
the AMU was informed by existing evidence on
the impact of the built environment on birth outcomes (Breedlove & Rathbun, 2019; Hodnett
et al., 2009; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence
et al., 2013; Newburn & Singh, 2003) and
through the use of an evidence-based guide, the
Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool
(BUDSET; Foureur et al., 2010; Jenkinson
et al., 2014). The BUDSET is based on a set of
birth environment design principles and is used to
measure the optimality of birth settings (Foureur
et al., 2010). The built environment refers to surroundings created for humans, by humans, that
provide the setting for human activities and
includes everything from landscapes to infrastructure to cities themselves (University of Windsor,
2021). The AMU’s built environment encompasses
the physical rooms as well as the architecture,
d´ecor, tools, and amenities available, including the
labor rooms, bathrooms, and common spaces.
Compared to conventional hospital units, the
AMU was purposefully designed aesthetically as
a “home-like” environment and was equipped to
provide comprehensive intrapartum care. While
we describe the AMU as “home-like” and much
of the literature describes creating domestic birth
spaces, we explicitly recognize that the concept
of “home” is not universal. It is important to
deconstruct this term which is pervasive in the
research. In general, “home-like” is used to imply
a place of safety, security, autonomy, and
domesticity; however, this may not be true for all
childbearing people, and for some, home may be
an unsafe place (Fannin, 2003; Michie, 1998).
The intention underlying the terminology is that
the space is less institutional, more personal, and
more familiar (Nilsson et al., 2020).
Review of the Literature
The physical environment significantly influences service user’s feelings of safety, relaxation,
sense of comfort, well-being, control, stress levels, satisfaction, and outcomes during birth
(Newburn & Singh, 2003; Rudman et al., 2007;
Setola et al., 2019). Further, these experiences,
satisfaction, and outcomes can be improved
through the incorporation of domestic features
(Foureur et al., 2010; Hammond, Homer, et al.,
2014; Mondy et al., 2016; Newburn & Singh,
2003; Nilsson et al., 2020; Rudman et al., 2007).
For example, flexible birth rooms that give people
the freedom to ambulate and give birth in upright
positions can result in fewer epidurals, shorter
labors, and fewer caesarean sections and are associated with fewer babies requiring admission to
intensive care (Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence
et al., 2013). The tools and furniture in birth rooms
that allow free positioning throughout labor and
birth contribute to improved outcomes by fostering
relaxation and supporting physiologic birth processes (Hammond et al., 2017; Igarashi et al.,
2014; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence et al.,
2013; Nilsson et al., 2020).
For healthcare providers, improving workplace design in healthcare settings has been
shown to reduce stress, enhance safety, productivity, job satisfaction, and quality of care. This
includes attention to the layout and configuration
of the unit and birth room, the flexibility of
the space, light and color, visual and sensory
190 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
elements, a social room for healthcare providers,
and incorporating elements of nature (Setola
et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2008).
The design of the birth environment has been
shown to influence job satisfaction and the way
healthcare professionals provide care, which in
turn may also impact birth outcomes (Hammond,
Foureur, et al., 2014; Hammond, Homer, et al.,
2014; Ulrich et al., 2008). Traditional hospitalbased birthing units have been identified as sometimes being a challenging setting for midwives, as
the environment is perceived to be overly medicalized and not designed to facilitate or support
care that optimizes physiologic birth and may
even directly hinder it (Foureur et al., 2010;
Hammond et al., 2013; Hammond, Homer,
et al., 2014). An improved birth unit design,
therefore, must support the physical, functional,
and psychological needs of midwives to support
the provision of quality care and meet the needs
of the person giving birth (Hammond, Homer,
et al., 2014).
The purpose of this study was to assess the
impact of the built environment of the first Canadian AMU for midwifery service users, along
with the midwives who work there. Our specific
objectives were to explore the meanings that
individuals attribute to the built environment and
to explore how this influences satisfaction with
birth space.
Method
Study Design
We conducted an explanatory, sequential mixed
methods using a grounded theory methodology.
This study was one component of a concurrent,
multiphase, mixed-methods evaluation of the
AMU, involving both midwives and midwifery
service users. Ethics approval was granted by
both the Markham Stouffville Hospital (Protocol
#78-1808) and Hamilton Integrated Research
Ethics Boards (Protocol # 5050 and 5056).
Sociospatial Conceptual Approach
Our study was informed by a sociospatial conceptual view of the birth environment. From this
perspective, the birth environment is defined as
not only a physical space but also a place that has
meaning and value invested within it by the people who interact with it. The birth environment is
shaped by what is physically in the room, such
as the design elements, equipment, and the
architecture, but also by broader sociocultural
expectations, norms, and influences, which are
constructed in part by the thoughts, feelings, and
responses of the people who use and interact with
the environment (Hammond et al., 2013). We
used this approach in developing our research
questions and data collection tools.
Recruitment and Inclusion Criteria
Our study population included midwifery service
users and midwives. Everyone admitted to the
AMU, including individuals whose care was later
transferred to an obstetrician on the L&D unit
during the intrapartum period, was eligible to participate in the study (Figure 1). We recruited
these participants during two time periods,
September 2018–March 2019 (Phase 1) and
September 2018–March 2020 (Phase 2). They
completed a consent to contact prior to hospital
discharge and a survey link was emailed 2-weeks
later. The survey included an invitation to participate in a follow-up interview conducted by telephone. All midwives who attended births at the
AMU from January to July 2020 were eligible to
participate and were recruited via email.
Data Collection
Midwifery service users completed an online survey, followed by an individual interview. Midwives participated in either an individual
interview or a focus group. The survey and interview questions for all participants, developed by
our research team, explored experiences of the
built environment of the AMU, including how
they used the space, their satisfaction, and evaluation of the equipment available to them. Individual interviews, completed via telephone, and the
focus group, conducted in person, were conducted by an experienced researcher and audio
recorded. We obtained informed consent from all
Murray-Davis et al. 191
individuals prior to their participation in all surveys, interviews, and focus groups.
In keeping with grounded theory approaches,
we conducted data analysis concurrently with
data collection to facilitate the iterative process
of constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss,
1967). Decisions to refine the interview guide
were made during peer debriefing meetings and
agreed on by the research team. We revised the
client Phase 2 survey and interview guide after
interim data analysis revealed that the physical
environment was an important factor shaping
birth experiences. As a result, the Phase 2 survey
and the interview guide were modified to
include more explicit questions about the impact
of the physical environment. We continued
recruitment until data saturation was reached
and no new data was emerging from the interviews (Sandelowski, 1995).
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed sequentially. First, we
analyzed the quantitative survey data. Descriptive
statistics were used to present the survey data
using Microsoft Excel. The Likert scales were
Figure 1. Mixed-methods research design.
192 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
collapsed into a three-point scale (Agree, Neutral,
and Disagree) and summarized into percentage
proportions. Next, we used grounded theory to
analyze our qualitative data. Specifically, data
collected from interviews were transcribed verbatim, read line-by-line, and open coded by three
researchers. To ensure reliability between coders,
codes were reviewed as a team to ensure agreement. We created categories by identifying relationships between related open codes; next, we
clustered categories together to form themes
(Charmaz, 2003). These themes were used to
develop a theoretical model. Triangulation of
multiple data sources, methods, and investigators
was used to ensure reliability and validity of our
findings (Carter et al., 2014).
Results
Fifty-nine service users completed the survey.
Twenty-eight services users and 11 midwives
participated in interviews and three midwives
participated in one focus group (Figure 1).
The majority of midwifery service-user participants had postsecondary education, earned a
total household income above US$100,000 per
year, and were similar in age (Table 1). Participants identified as East Asian (8.5%), South
Asian (15.3%), White-European (13.6%), and
White-North American (47.5%). Due to the small
number of midwifery participants, we did not collect detailed demographic data to preserve their
anonymity; however, most of midwives had
worked 3–10 years in healthcare (40.9%) and
worked at that hospital between 3 and 10 years
(45.5%; Table 2).
Quantitative Findings
The survey findings indicated that service users
were highly satisfied with their experiences in the
AMU and with elements of the built environment.
Components of their experiences that were rated
as highly satisfying included: the check-in/welcome experience (93.6%), atmosphere (97.9%),
physical space (93.4%), the tools and equipment
available (83.2%), and the accommodations made
for family members (84.0%; Figure 2). In terms
of birth equipment, the peanut ball (49.1%),
murphy bed (42.4%), and birth chair (37.3%)
were used most frequently, while the birth pool
(3.4%) and sling (0%) were least frequently used
(Figure 3).
Qualitative Findings
Our interview findings confirmed and expanded
on the survey findings and supported the development of a theoretical model, whereby “making
space” for midwifery in the hospital contributed
to positive experiences and overall satisfaction
with the built environment of the AMU. “Making
space” is accomplished through three crucial
steps: creating a domestic space in an institutional
setting, shifting the technological approach, and
sharing ownership of the space (Figure 4). We use
“making space” both literally, as the AMU is a
separate physical space designed and built in the
hospital, and figuratively, as midwives and their
service users were given the space, power, and
freedom to labor and birth independently according to midwifery philosophies of care (Figure 5).
We review each theme below and participant
quotes have been organized by theme in Table 3.
Creating a Domestic Space in an Institutional
Setting
The AMU was designed to look and feel cozy,
relaxing, comfortable, and intentionally different
from the traditional hospital environment, which
participants described as “cold and sterile.”
Despite being located within the hospital, the
atmosphere, aesthetics, spaciousness, and the
ways it supported family members all contributed
to the AMU feeling more domestic than institutional. The atmosphere was described by midwives as being quiet, calm, spa-like, and very
welcoming to families.
Service users chose similar words to describe
the atmosphere and went further to articulate that
it felt private and intimate and noted the atmosphere was very different from a hospital ward.
Multiparous people who had previously given
birth on the traditional labor unit noted that the
AMU was calmer in comparison. The AMU aesthetics included soft wall colors, nature murals,
artwork, birth affirmations, and soft furniture
Murray-Davis et al. 193
(Figure 6). Service users appreciated that the
space’s design and aesthetic felt very intentional
to support the philosophies of midwifery care.
They described how the ambiance, including
music and lighting customization, contributed to
their comfort and relaxation in the space, feeling
strongly that their surroundings impacted their
mood and birth experience.
Both service users and midwives enjoyed the
spaciousness of the AMU and birthing rooms.
The AMU was less crowded and busy than the
traditional labor unit due to fewer people, fewer
visible supplies, and medical equipment, resulting in more open spaces (Figure 7). The midwives
noted that the birthing rooms were free from
“clutter”—such as the traditional hospital bed,
pumps and preprimed intravenous sets, and most
obstetric equipment, making the room feel more
spacious. The service users appreciated the sense
of space they felt in their room.
A major design element of the AMU was to
create an environment that felt more like a

domestic space than a hospital. Service users
commonly described the AMU as “the best of
both worlds,” meaning the best of homebirth and
hospital birth combined. This referred to the ability to have a home-like environment while still
being in the hospital, with quick, easy access to
obstetrical care if needed, unlike at a planned
homebirth. The space also accommodated and
supported partners and families through the family lounge and kitchen, comfortable furniture,
and the birthing room being large enough to comfortably accommodate their presence. Families
also expressed feeling welcome in the space by
AMU staff, noting that the space was set up to
support their involvement in the birthing
experience.
Overall, the ambiance, aesthetics, and familyorientation created a domestic space that contributed to feelings of comfort and relaxation.
Shifting the Technological Approach
The design of the AMU moved away from the
biomedical and technological focus of childbirth
characterized by a reliance on technology. This
shift occurred by removing from the birth space
much of the technology that was not routinely
used. The primary motivation for this was to
decrease access to unnecessary equipment and
therefore demonstrate respect for judicious rather
than routine use of technology. Put simply, if the
continuous fetal heart rate monitor is present in
the room, it will be used. However, this removal
of equipment had two consequences. First, it
reduced the amount of unnecessary equipment,

which created more open space for people to
move about and labor freely. Second, it allowed
for the introduction of nontechnology-based labor
and birth tools and equipment. For example, since
the traditional equipments, such as the fetal heart
monitor, obstetric bed, and neonatal warmer.
were brought in only when needed, items to support physiologic birth, such as bars, slings, mats,
and birth stools, were prioritized and visible. On
the traditional labor ward, these tools had previously not been available, not accessible due to
space limitations. By comparison, in the
purpose-built AMU, these tools and equipment
were at the midwife’s fingertips and promoted
their use to support physiologic birth (Figure 8).
The tools were conveniently located, and they
had more of these tools at their disposal than ever
before.
Service users enjoyed and appreciated the
variety of resources available since it gave them
more opportunities to find the right tool or position while coping with contractions. However,
some service users felt they needed better education about the tools, how to use them, how they
were beneficial in labor, and at what stages in
labor they were helpful. Without this information,
clients often refrained from using the equipment
at all. For example, some service users reported
not knowing about the ability to control the lighting and music in the room.
Overall, both service users and midwives
reported that removing and modifying the technology and equipment in the birthing room created a space that was flexible and usable.
Midwives had the ability to remove, move, or add
equipment as necessary to accommodate the
needs of each individual. The open space facilitated mobility, freedom of movement, and the
ability to use more of the space.
A unique design feature of the AMU birth
spaces was the replacement of traditional hospital
beds with a queen-sized murphy bed that
was folded down from the wall only when in use
(Figure 9). This shifted the focus away from the
bed being the center of the room. The bed was
hidden until needed, which provided more space
in the room for the client to use, be mobile in, and
have family present. The midwives described that
ideally the bed would only be used for postpartum
recovery, but many service users still expected
they would labor and give birth on a bed and
desired this experience. Feedback from service
users indicated that they appreciated the murphy
bed particularly in the postpartum time when they
could relax and bond with their baby. They also
liked that it was big enough to fit their partner.
Not having the bed directly available really reinforced movement and encouraged service users to
try other tools and equipment. However, while
there were benefits of this style of bed, it was

Creating a domestic

institutional setting
Service user
I liked the peacefulness of it. It felt very relaxed and Zen ... . compared to a regular
hospital unit where you have four people in a triage room, and you have people
screaming, and people all around you, this was much more secluded, much quieter,
which really made me feel like I could relax during labour, which I really important
to me
It didn’t feel like a typical hospital room by any means, with the beautiful murals, and
everything, it just kind of provided a different atmosphere, and I also loved the option
for calm hallways where we could walk as I was labouring, and read the motivational
quotes on the wall
It was just enough space. It wasn’t too crowded. It allowed me to bring my belongings
and allowed me to walk around the room without having to feel like everyone was
around me that it was too close, so I liked our actual room, and it was very private
and just the perfect size.
I am so happy I went through that method, because you really have the comfort and
relaxation as if you were in a home setting, but still have the expertise and the team
available to you to make everything go smoothly.

It was a really good set up for my partner. The rooms have comfy couches. They have
lounge chairs. There’s a kitchen. Partners can be looked after and feel part of the
process too, I think, as much as they can
They had lots of space so that my family could be in the room with me, which was

It seems quiet. Even when we’re really, really busy, it never feels as loud or as busy as it
did over on labour and delivery
MW-B: It’s just less cluttered, too, with less people milling around. There’s less
bothering them, so it feels just like an organized space so you could come in and be
ready to do what you need to do
MW-C: and you go over [to L&D], and It’s almost like the walls are coming in on you
and I think, too, because There’s so many more people in the same space, whereas
you come over here and you might only have one or two people on the entire unit
I think it’s the space itself is really helpful to labouring women, because the attempt was
to make it more of a homelike experience, because often when they’re leaving home
and then coming into a new environment, it can be a bit stressful, which can shut
labour down a little bit, slow it down. So the attempt to mimic a homey type
atmosphere, I think, is encouraging to the labour progress itself

The birthing rooms were great. The Jacuzzi tubs were great. I laboured in that for a bit.
They had bars along the wall to help to squat or whatever and whatnot during
contractions. The birthing stool was awesome, the Murphy bed. No, overall, the
environment was great... . This is also why I went the midwifery route is because
you can labour in whatever way you want, right? And there were just so many
options, right? I went from the bathroom where there was a Jacuzzi, like the jets. The

bars on the wall, I could do it on the bed. I was on all fours on the ground. I was in the
birthing stool. I was lying flat on the floor. There was tons of space around me and I
think that allowed me to kind of like be in whatever position I wanted, which is
exactly what I needed
The ability to move around. It was really accommodating to being in labour I felt. Just
having ... the space to really labour in different ways was fantastic. It made it feel not
closed in or anything or rushed. It just kind of felt like ... the space was there to use
as we needed it, which was great. It felt like our space
I think having it being able to kept away gave us that extra space for me to pace and just
even allow us labouring in the one spot, just that openness helped
Midwife
Yeah, it’s a hospital room. Don’t get me wrong. There’s oxygen on the wall, there’s all
of that, but there isn’t a lot of clinical equipment. So there isn’t that anxiety that
comes right away, I’m in a hospital room with a bed and a warmer and all of those
things. It’s all tucked away. It’s all hidden, it’s covered
There’s just so many options that the women and the clients, they’re all up to try
anything. And it’s almost like the midwives will have a bigger toolbox full of tools that
they can use. I mean sterile water, the TENS machine. They can bring the mom and
put her in the bathtub or they can do a water birth if they want. There’s so many
more tools that we can use
It felt like we didn’t really use the entire room before on the other unit, like it was the
same space and everything, but I felt like we used half of the room ... whereas now
it’s kind of like no, just use the whole thing. Like I find that even, I get them to sit on
the chairs that were designated for us and like just anywhere. Live your life anywhere
in this room, the whole thing is yours. I see more clients pulling out their personal
belongings... pictures and things to make it feel a little bit homier for themselves
[O]ne of the outcomes of the physical space, I know has been to encourage more
physiological positioning in labour, more upright positioning in births and that is
definitely something the way that the physicality of each room is laid out, that it really
enables that. Anybody’s who has sort of worked in the birth environment will know
that if you bring somebody labouring into a room and there’s a bed there, it’s very
easy for that person to just climb into the bed and lay there. But we know that that’s
not the best place to labour. So in our rooms, the bed is not immediately visible
unless this client is requesting an epidural and we know that that’s in their birth plan
and that’s what they’re going to do when they become active in labour. And that’s
definitely something that I’ve seen as well. It’s very clear that like clients are more
physiological in their labouring rather than sort of gravitating towards a flat surface
and lying down
For the most part, the Murphy beds are tucked away. They’re there when women need
to relax after birth. Or if they need a little rest during labour, they can lie on their
side on this Murphy bed that pulls down. But ambulation, upright posture, in a
Rebozo sling type device, in the water, all of these approaches to supporting
labouring people are well supported by the research literature to help facilitate
normal physiologic birth

articulated as not being ideal for perineal suturing
due to its low height, which placed ergonomic
strain on midwives.
Sharing Ownership of the Space
We found that all users of the space, service users,
midwives, and family described a sense of individual ownership over the space. For midwives,
this stemmed from the space being solely for midwifery care and governed and run by midwives.
The governance of this space was an important
aspect of ownership, as midwives were able to
create their own care standards based on
evidence-based midwifery approaches to care.
Midwives recounted how this facilitated a sense
of power and autonomy, knowing that the space
was designed specifically to support their

[We] have a pantry and the working environment for the midwives, there’s a team

very reinforcing of validating everyone’s job and everyone’s work there, and making
sure that they have space that they call their own

positive experience and a good experience

I find having the couches out of there makes the partner be more involved. And it’s just
a chair that’s not super inviting and then having us be in the whole space, it’s like you
have to be involved or otherwise you’re just in the corner. Yeah, they’re really
engaged and they like all the stuff. They seem to like all the things we have

philosophy of care and validated their work. Service users supported this sentiment, valuing a
space that was designed to promote the type of
care and birth philosophies they were seeking
when choosing midwifery care. Features like the
staff room and meeting rooms gave midwives a
sense of belonging and camaraderie that had been
missing since they had never previously had dedicated spaces in the hospital.
Those birthing on the unit demonstrated multidimensional ownership of the space, by taking
control of their physical surroundings and their
birth experience. In the birthing room, they had
flexibility to modify the space, including the
equipment, labor tools, and furniture. They also
had the ability to personalize the lighting and
music and were encouraged to bring personal
items to make the space more comfortable, such
as LED candles, pictures, and curated music playlists. The birthing room was described as a space
that became their own, almost an extension of
their home. The built environment also facilitated
greater ownership over the birth experience. This
was achieved by using a variety of birthing tools,
hydrotherapy, and movement into various positions for laboring and pushing, and ambulating
in the room and in the hallways. Midwifery service users expressed feeling a sense of control
over their experience as a result of having more
options. The midwives noted that ownership and
customization of the space contributed to relaxation, improved outcomes, and an overall better
birth experiences for service users.
Finally, family members also shared in this
sense of ownership since they were able to be
an integral part of the birth experience. All participants expressed appreciation that families had
enough space in the birthing room to settle in and
be comfortable, without feeling crowded and that
spaces such as the lounge and kitchen accommodated families. Additionally, the midwives
believed that partners were more involved in
labor support on account of the increased space
and room for movement.

Discussion
This study, underpinned by a sociospatial conceptual approach, used grounded theory to explore
the impact of the built environment of Canada’s
first AMU from the perspective of both midwives
and service users. The findings revealed that the
intentional design elements of the unit facilitated
positive experiences and contributed to greater
satisfaction with the birth experience. We attribute these positive experiences to three key ways
of “making space” for midwifery-led birth—creating a domestic space in an institutional setting,
shifting the technological approach, and sharing
ownership of the AMU (Figure 5). These findings
contribute to the growing literature advocating
for the benefits of evidence-based birth unit
design (Berg et al., 2019). Framing these findings
within the sociospatial approach, it is clear that
the experiences of midwives and service users
were not due to the space alone, but how the
space was used, which was co-created by everyone who entered the unit, and was underpinned by
midwifery philosophies (Figure 5).
Our results support previous research, which
emphasized the importance of ownership and
control in the birthspace (Igarashi et al., 2014;
Mondy et al., 2016; Setola et al., 2019). The birthing rooms and family lounge contributed to families feeling welcomed and involved in the
birthing process (Mondy et al., 2016; Nielsen &
Overgaard, 2020; Setola et al., 2019). The unit
was described as “the best of both worlds,” a
similar finding to that of Kuliukas et al. (2016)
in a co-located birth center in Australia (Kuliukas
et al., 2016). These findings support offering a
third option to give birth, as neither home nor
traditional hospital may be the optimal fit.
The flexibility of the space was a key component to participants’ satisfaction, making it easier
for midwives to fully promote physiological birth
and giving birthing people ownership and options
(Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014; Setola et al.,
2019). It is important that this flexibility was
recognized and utilized by both care provider and
service users since the birthing environment must
meet the needs of everyone in the space (Dana &
Wambach, 2003; Setola et al., 2019; Skogstro¨m
Figure 9. Double murphy bed.
Murray-Davis et al. 203
et al., 2022). In traditional hospital labor wards,
midwives often attempted to modify the physical
environment to try and make the space more
domestic or to facilitate normal birth (Bourgeault
et al., 2012; Davis & Homer, 2016; Igarashi
et al., 2014) but were constrained by what the
space would allow (Mondy et al., 2016). Our
findings are in line with those of Hammond et al.
(2013), demonstrating that the ways in which
midwives use the birth space is impactful, as
midwives were more effective at promoting
physiologic, low risk birth when working in an
environment that supports their professional
needs (Hammond et al., 2013).
Our findings stress the impact and importance
of midwives feeling a sense of ownership and
belongingin the birthspace. Previous findings from
Bourgeault (2012) found that midwives felt like
visitors in labor wards and guests at homebirths
and described “borrowing space” that explicitly
did not belong to them (Bourgeault et al., 2012).
This newfound sense of ownership, belonging and
control described by midwives on the unit is an
important finding and warrants further research
to explore how this impacts practitioner confidence, professional identity, and job satisfaction.
As now neither a visitor in clients’ homes, nor
guest in the labor ward, midwives working on the
AMU exist in a liminal space, which Brown et al.
(2017) described as phenomena that do not fit
into normal categories but fall “betwixt and
between.” The unit is neither home, nor hospital,
yet has overlapping elements with both. The
liminality of the unit is potentially why the space
is so effective for clients and midwives, as its
flexibility allows the space to be used in whatever
ways are needed by clients or their caregivers.
The space can become whatever is desired, providing both parties a sufficiently strong internal
locus of control to feel a sense of ownership of the
space. Its character as neither home nor institution alleviates the risk narrative of home birth,
and the flexibility of the space allows for the tenet
of choice to be made manifest.
Implications for Practice
As Canada’s first AMU, this analysis is critical
for identifying factors that should be considered
when designing future birth spaces to optimize
the environment for all. Our model for creating,
shifting, and sharing as a way to make space for
midwifery approaches can serve as a template for
other centers looking at intentional design to promote favorable outcomes and user satisfaction.
This model of care and the intentional design
of the birth environment may be an important
component to midwifery retention, which is an
ongoing problem globally. In a recent study in
Western Canada, one third of midwives surveyed
had seriously considered leaving the profession
(Geraghty et al., 2019). The literature thus far has
not specifically addressed what impact the physical environment and its association with autonomy may contribute to midwife job satisfaction
and attrition. However, our findings suggest that
this type of model may help contribute to better
midwifery retention through both cognitive and
physical benefits. Decreased stress levels, greater
satisfaction at work, and the shift away from hierarchical power structures may address common
sources of burnout (Bloxsome et al., 2019; Geraghty et al., 2019; Stoll & Gallagher, 2019).
There are further implications to using “homelike” as a design goal. From an equity lens, there
may be a benefit to the unit having a stereotypical
“home-like” aesthetic, as it provides an alternative to homebirth for those who don’t have a
home-space that provides the same safety, comfort, ambiance, and spaciousness as the AMU.
Our mixed-methods approach strengthened
the study as we were able to confirm our findings
through data triangulation. Limitations of the
study stem from the fact that we did not collect
data from patients with other care providers at the
same hospital, nor did we investigate midwifery
service user’s experiences in the traditional labor
ward prior to the opening of the midwifery unit.
Also, our findings may not be generalizable to
other communities due to the specific demographics of the midwifery population who
participated.
Conclusion
The built environment of AMU resulted in positive experiences and satisfaction among all participants. The domestic environment was relaxing
204 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)
and comfortable for those in labor, while still
maintaining proximity to emergency care. This
purpose-built space designed with equipment and
resources to support midwife-led care encouraged
flexibility and choice for those giving birth.
Finally, the built environment led to a greater
sense of ownership for all those giving and
receiving care. This went beyond the space and
how it is designed, to include how it was used
and co-created by midwives, service users, and
their families.
Implications for Practice
 To optimize the birth environment for all,
institutional birth settings should consider
incorporating domestic elements and demedicalizing the space to promote midwifery
approaches to care which support physiologic birth.
 Midwifery ownership and self-governance
contribute to how the space is used and
co-created with service users. This agency
and ownership foster a sense of belonging,
which is an important contributor to healthcare provider job satisfaction.
 A positive built environment for the birth
setting may have a meaningful impact on
addressing attrition and retention in the midwifery profession through decreased stress
and increased job satisfaction.
 Optimizing the birth environment can
improve childbirth satisfaction among
women and birthing people and their families. But service users need to be informed
about how to optimally interact and make
use of the space during the antenatal period.

10.1177/19375867221148168,Evidence-Based Design in the Hospital Environment: A Staff’s Burnout Study in the COVID-19 Era,2023,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the evidence-based design of the hospital physical space effect on the burnout of nurses and physicians during COVID-19. The research question was to identify the connection between daylight, nature-view windows, and hospital staff burnout during Covid-19. Background: The evidence-based design in the hospital environment affects the health of the medical staff. The promotion of the hospital environment has a significant effect on healthcare system improvement. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 406 nurses and physician’s burnout in Guilan province in 2020. Three questionnaires were used: demographic, physical space of the hospital, daylight, nature-view windows, and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Logistic regression (LR) analysis was used to determine the association between burnout and the hospital environment. The significance level was considered with p <.05. Results: The results showed statistically significant correlations between patient units and the environmental characteristics of the hospitals with staff’s burnout (p <.001). Of note, 62.9% of physicians and 71.9% of nurses had moderate work-related burnout. The highest burnout score was seen among staffs of emergency departments adjusted multivariate LR model revealed that 27.1% of work-related burnout in nurses and physicians was predictable with age, light, marital status, and hospitals. Our results showed that accessing more daylight could reduce burnout (p =.018, odds ratio [OR] = 0.910). Conclusion: Based on the result, the daylight impact on burnout reduction is more significant than other factors. It is suggested that adequate lighting, proper environmental design, and nature-view windows could create appropriate space for enhancing medical staff satisfaction and reducing burnout. © The Author(s) 2023.","The number of People with Dementia (PwD) is rising worldwide. World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1).
Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2).
This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,
 
learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD.
It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented
 

 

as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5).
In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6).
The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,
 

and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7).
Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns.
There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,

that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14).
Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related.
In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).

1.1        Research gap

In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research.
There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have.
The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of
 

fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).

2.        Materials and methods

This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research.
The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users.
A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy.
The survey consists of:

1.        identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development)
2.        choice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition)
3.        processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)

The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare
 

 

facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.

2.1        Assessment framework development from the case study analysis

The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing
- thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).

2.2        Web-based survey definition

The survey was divided into 4 parts:

1.        The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only.
2.        The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.
 

3.        The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question.
Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD.
The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development:
-        location,
-        shared spaces,
-        paths,
-        living areas,
-        external spaces,
-        technologies,
-        bedrooms.
4.        In the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.

2.3. Data collection and analysis

The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible.
The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...).
It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer.
The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.

3.        Results

The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.
 


 
Figure 2. Analysis table for case studies.
 

 

The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid.
The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined.
This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces.
Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.
 

3.1.        Section 1 – Statistical data

The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).

3.2.        Location

The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).
 
3.3.        General aspects

As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about
10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development.
However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.
 


 

Figure 7. The questionnaire results about the general idea about the structure of healthcare facilities for the elderly.




Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
3.4.        Distribution

56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8).
It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.
 
3.5.        Living area

The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9).
Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,
 


 

Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.



Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.


 
where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.

3.6.        Outdoor space

The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,
 
such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.

3.7.        Future trends

Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a
 


 

Figure 11. The opinion about the future of healthcare facilities.



Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.

 
prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11).
This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.
 
3.8.        Personalization

The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners.
In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a
 

 

viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.

3.9.        Other considerations

The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire.
These can be divided into three main themes:

A)        Issues related to the content:
-        I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff;
-        In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process;
-        Single room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside;
-        I believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”;
-        A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration;
-        Fundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important
 

to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife;
- I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community;
B)        Issues related to the form and process of the survey:
-        Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions;
-        Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities;
C)        Issues related to staff training and education:
-        All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself );
-        Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces;
-        It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and
 

 

chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.

3.10.        Comparison of the results

The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses.
Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,
 

favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).

4.        Discussion and conclusion

The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with

the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed.
The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.

5.        Research limitations and future developments

The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage
 

and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents.
However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

To provide convergent evidence about the association between cardiac intensive care and the physical environment, searches were conducted in the PubMed, Google Scholar, and other databases as well as in certain specialized journals. The inclusion criteria included qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods studies, or systematic reviews; written in English; and related to the built environmental design of cardiac intensive care. The contents of the selected articles were first extracted and then analyzed and synthesized. The results of this review demonstrated that the CICU physical design had a strong influence on patient health and safety. A total of more than forty CICU design recommendations were identified. In practice, all environmental and nonenvironmental factors should be holistically considered in the design decision-making process. The next step is the development and testing of prototypes that incorporate relevant design strategies before wide application. This literature review disclosed the key design strategies that enhance the physical design of CICUs.

Alansari, Xiaobo Quan, Some Rights Reserved.","ardiac intensive care units (CICUs), in particular, and intensive care units (ICUs), in general, 
are considered to be the most complex places in a hospital. CICUs (also called cardiac care 
units, acute coronary care units, or critical coronary care units) provide special, systematic, 
team-based critical care to patients recovering from cardiac surgeries and patients with severe 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs—serious or life-threatening heart conditions such as heart attacks, 
acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure) and complications such as renal failure 
and respiratory issues (Loughran et al. 2017). Like CVDs, health conditions treated in ICUs are often 
the leading causes of deaths as well as elevated healthcare costs in the United States and other countries 
(e.g., Bowry et al. 2015; Dasta et al. 2005). 
Intensive care medicine was developed over 60 years ago and has evolved in order to better 
manage critical ill patients through temporarily supporting or replacing the functions of major 
organ systems (Kelly et al. 2014). However, hospitals face several challenges, including hospitalacquired infections, patient falls, and nurse back pain and injury, in intensive care. These safety 
and quality issues may lead to negative patient outcomes, increased mortality, and waste of
precious resources. The successful management of these issues constitutes a key component of
the successful delivery of intensive care. 
ICUs are specialized healthcare settings that require high levels of staffing and intensive use 
of technology and other resources. Because of the high acuity levels and complex conditions, 
patients in CICUs and ICUs require continuous and close monitoring by clinicians with special 
training (Kasaoka 2017). As a result, the staff-to-patient ratio is much higher in these units than 
typical medical–surgical care units. Furthermore, many types of specialized technological 
equipment (e.g., electrocardiography, intra-aortic balloon pump, mechanical ventilator) are used 
in intensive care for patient monitoring and treatment (Kasaoka 2017). In addition, patient

experiences of intensive care are quite different from those of patients in other healthcare settings. 
Hooked up to wires and tubes, patients typically spend several days to several weeks in ICUs 
with limited awareness of their surroundings (Katz et al. 2010). All the aforementioned unique 
features of intensive care should be thoroughly considered in the process of quality improvement 
aiming at reducing costs, improving healthcare outcomes, and enhancing patient experience. 
Role of the Physical Environment in Healthcare 
The physical environment of ICUs may play a significant role in improving healthcare safety and 
quality. An increasing number of research studies published in many disciplines (e.g., medicine, 
nursing, building design, engineering) have clearly demonstrated the critical effects of the
physical environment on key patient and staff outcomes, including healthcare-associated 
infections (HAI), patient falls, medical errors, patient anxiety, pain, patient satisfaction, job 
satisfaction, work efficiency, and work-related injuries (Ulrich et al. 2004, 2008). 
Much healthcare environment design research has been conducted in ICUs; therefore, their 
findings may be directly applied to ICU design. For example, single-bed rooms were found to be
associated with significant reduction of respiratory, urinary tract, and catheter-related infections as well 
as length of stay in a pediatric ICU (Ben-Abraham et al. 2002). Another recent study compared two
ICUs and found that patients younger than 65 years were less likely to experience delirium in the unit 
with single rooms and windows than in the other unit that featured windowless multibed rooms 
(Arenson et al. 2013). In a coronary critical care unit (CCU), researchers found that the installation of
sound-absorbing ceiling tiles led to shortened reverberation times and improved speech intelligibility 
as well as reduction in staff members’ self-reported work demands and strain (Blomkvist et al. 2005). 
Findings from a variety of other healthcare settings may also be adapted to inform ICU design 
decision-making or design innovation. For example, a study conducted in outpatient medical offices 
indicated a positive correlation between environmental attractiveness and higher levels of perceived 
quality, satisfaction, and staff interaction and lower patient anxiety (Becker and Douglass 2008). The
installation of ceiling lifts in an extended care facility significantly reduced staff injuries related to
patient handling, days lost, workers’ compensation claims, and direct costs associated with patient 
handling injuries (Chhokar et al. 2005). Visual artworks were found to help reduce the anxiety and 
agitation of psychiatric patientsin a mental health facility (Nanda et al. 2011). 
These research efforts have resulted in substantial increases of the amount and quality of
evidence that should be continuously tracked and applied in practice to maximize the benefits for 
patients, families, staff, and healthcare organizations. 
Translating Research Evidence into Design Innovations 
Evidence-based design (EBD) is a process of environmental design that utilizes credible research 
evidence and methodology to improve outcomes (The Center for Health Design, n.d.). EBD is an
example of translational research that facilitates the application of research findings by creating 
design resources and tools that meet practical needs. It addresses the disconnect between research 
and design often observed in the environmental design field. The disconnect partially originates 
from the fact that peer-reviewed research journal articles published in medicine and other 
scientific disciplines are difficult for many design professionals to access and understand. To
address this problem, many extensive literature reviews have been conducted in recent years on
various EBD topics to make the research knowledge readily available to practitioners. Examples 
include a comprehensive review conducted by Ulrich et al. (2008) on all environmental elements 
that impact healthcare outcomes, a systematic review focusing on long-term residential care 
facilities (Joseph, Choi, and Quan 2015), and a systematic review on how maternity room design 
may impact maternal and neonate outcomes (Nilsson et al. 2020). However, it remains a challenge 
to periodically update the reviews and stay current with the latest developments in research.

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
Another potential cause of the gap between research and design is the lack of easy-to-use EBD 
resources and tools as well as compelling EBD examples that show how research findings from
different sources may be integrated to create design solutions or innovations that significantly 
contribute to the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery. One example of design 
resources is the “Guidelines for Intensive Care Unit Design” developed by a multidisciplinary team 
on the basis of research evidence and expert knowledge (Thompson et al. 2012). Another type of
effort is the development of prototypes for healthcare environments that visually demonstrate all 
relevant EBD features, which would effectively speed up the translational research. This research 
study is one step toward developing such a prototype of evidence-based CICU design. 
Aim of the Study 
This research study aimed to develop a set of key EBD considerations for a prototype (3-
Dimensional) CICU that would promote patient health and safety while reducing staff stress and 
fatigue. As the first step in developing the prototype, a literature review was conducted to update 
previous reviews by examining the most recent research around ICU environments. 
Research Question 
What are the main environmental design features that promote patients’ health and safety in the CICU? 
Methodology 
The literature review process involved three main steps: establishment of a conceptual 
framework, literature search, and literature analysis and synthesis. 
Conceptual Framework 
The conceptual framework for EBD developed by Ulrich et al. (2010) was adopted to guide the 
literature search and review. In this framework, the built environment design variables are 
classified into nine categories: 
▪ Audio environment (e.g., sound-absorbing characteristics of finishes, acoustic walls)
▪ Visual environment (e.g., windows, building orientation)
▪ Safety enhancement (e.g., staff visual access to patients, handwashing sinks)
▪ Wayfinding system (e.g., building entrance, signage)
▪ Sustainability (e.g., building mass, building envelope)
▪ Patient room (e.g., single room, same-handed layout)
▪ Family support spaces (e.g., overnight bed in patient room)
▪ Staff support spaces (e.g., decentralized nurse station, proximity of supplies)
▪ Physician support spaces (e.g., operating room, air quality, lighting)
These design variables directly impact healthcare participant outcomes, including patient outcomes 
(e.g., hospital-acquired infections, sleep quality, length of stay), family outcomes (e.g., quality of
communication, stress, satisfaction), physician and other staff outcomes (e.g., work performance, 
perceived fatigue), and organizational outcomes (e.g., cost, revenue). The relationships between design 
variables and outcomes are mediated by confounding factors, including demographics and 
organizational factors such as culture, occupancy rate, and nurse-to-patient ratio. 
Literature Search 
A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. The methodology of conducting research 
from the literature review involved the thematic approach, in which credible scholarly journal articles 
focusing on the physical environment’s impacts on patients and nurses in CICUs were searched and 
reviewed. An initial search of the literature was conducted using several databases, including Google 
Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. The criteria for inclusion included the following: 
63

THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN 
▪ Empirical research articles published in peer-reviewed journals
▪ English language
▪ Publication between 2000 and 2019
▪ Evidence on connections between environment design and healthcare outcomes that
potentially can be used to inform ICU design
A list of keywords, including design variables (e.g., layout, lighting) and outcomes (e.g., infections, 
patient falls), adapted from the conceptual framework was used in the literature search. Additional 
articles were extracted from relevant literature reviews that were conducted previously. The 
abstracts and full-text articles were examined to eliminate those that did not meet the criteria for 
inclusion. The process resulted in a short list of relevant articles for further analysis. 
Data Extraction and Synthesis 
The shortlisted studies were transferred from the source databases to Excel, and then the 
publication information was documented in Excel. The researchers reviewed all the study 
findings. Finally, forty-four research articles (various types, including original research, literature 
review, methodology, and expert consensus) found to be relevant met the requirements of the 
review and the aim of this study. The included articles were reviewed twice by the researchers 
for relevance, and their contents were first extracted and then analyzed and synthesized. The 
credibility of the research evidence was evaluated according to widely accepted criteria of
empirical research (e.g., Pati 2011). Different aspects of design were coded to generate themes, 
and related concepts were clustered together under the emerged themes. 
Results
An ICU typically contains a variety of spaces (e.g., patient rooms, workstations, corridors) for
different user groups. This section first summarizes the design considerations applicable to all 
spaces and then focuses on recommendations for the spaces used only by a specific group of users—
patients, families, or staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, and other staff). See the complete list 
in Table 1. The last part includes the recommendations around the design process of considering the 
relevant factors and integrating multiple features into the best design solution.

Safety Enhancement 
The physical environment plays a critical role in enhancing healthcare safety (Joseph, Henriksen, 
and Malone 2018; Olmsted 2016). An important design consideration for healthcare environments 
such as ICUs that impacts not only safety but also work efficiency is the visual sightline connection 
between various spaces (e.g., workstations and patient rooms). In a qualitative study conducted by
Pati, Harvey, and Pati (2014), visibility was reported by healthcare professionals as one of the top 
issues around emergency department (ED) safety and efficiency. Several key visibility design 
recommendations may be applicable to ICU design: locating the unit entrance in the direct sightline 
of reception and security, providing visual connection between different clinical work zones, and 
designing unit layout (e.g., corridor shape, workstation location) to maximize visibility from
workstations to patient rooms (Pati, Harvey, and Pati 2014). Physicians and nurses reported that 
greater levels of visibility led to increased productivity and teamwork efficiency, and contributed to
higher security (Gharaveis et al. 2018).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
One of the goals of improving visibility for patient monitoring isto reduce patient falls, which 
poses a serious challenge in ICUs and may result in injuries, extended hospitalization, and high 
costs. However, there is no single “silver bullet” for fall prevention, and a multifaceted solution 
that includes education, communication, environment, and medication should be used to
minimize the incidence of falls and injuries (Rowe 2013). Among environmental factors, certain 
flooring, such as carpets, may help reduce patient’s fear of falling, incidence of falls, and severity 
of injuries related to falls (Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). A 
retrospective analysis of patient fall reports revealed several environment contributors of patient 
falls: uneven floor surfaces, poor nighttime lighting, and limited visibility for surveillance 
(Bayramzadeh, Portillo, and Carmel-Gilfilen 2019). 
HAIs are infections that people acquire when they are receiving healthcare services. HAIs may 
cause high morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay and suffering, rehospitalization, high 
costs, and dissatisfaction (Ulrich et al. 2008). The following design features have been found in
research as contributors to HAI prevention: physical separation between patients (e.g., single-bed 
rooms with private bathrooms), accessible hand hygiene sinks and gel dispensers, high-efficiency air 
disinfection and filtration, interior finish materials that are easy to clean and maintain (Nanda, Malone, 
and Joseph 2012; Ulrich et al. 2008). A 2006 study found that vinyl flooring was more durable and 
easier to maintain as well as produced lower VOC emissions (Lankford et al. 2006).
Medication errors are preventable mistakes in the process of medication use (e.g., preparing, 
dispensing, and administration) that could potentially cause harms to patients. Research has found that 
medication errors could be reduced by providing high-illumination task lighting and reducing 
unexpected noises in staff work zones (Ulrich et al. 2008). Dedicated medication rooms should provide 
adequate spaces for staff members with minimal disruptions (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; 
Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). Acuity-adaptable rooms were designed to accommodate patients 
through different levels of care; therefore, they may help reduce the necessity of intra-hospital 
transfers—a source of medical errors (Hendrich, Fay, and Sorrells 2004).
Security, or the prevention of violence, is an important subset of healthcare safety. It turns 
out that visibility also significantly impacts security. As Gharaveis et al. (2018) found, staff 
members recommended visual surveillance over the unit entry as well as open layout and 
decentralization that facilitated undisrupted sightlines. Additional design features recommended 
for security included traffic management (e.g., one-way traffic) and dedicated areas for special 
populations (e.g., mental health patients) (Gharaveis et al. 2018; Pati, Pati, and Harvey 2016). 
Visual Environment 
Patients in ICUs often experience negative mood states such as anxiety and fear. The ICU visual 
and audio environment constitutes an important factor determining patient physical (e.g., sleep 
disturbances) and psychological experiences (e.g., anxiety, depression; see Topçu et al. 2017). 
Appropriate visual stimuli should be incorporated in the environmental design to speed up recovery 
by alleviating the negative moods. The provision of positive distractions and natural daylight has 
been found to effectively reduce stress and improve outcomes (e.g., better sleep at night, faster 
recovery). High levels of daylight (as measured by the daylight factor—the ratio of the daylight 
level inside a building to the daylight level outside) were associated with a shorter length of stay in
a U.S. hospital and a Korean hospital (Choi 2004). Nature images with sky and trees generated 
higher ratings in perceived pleasantness and activated brain regions associated with general positive 
feelings, as shown in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Pati et al. 2014). 
Simulated nature scenes presented on ceiling-mounted fixtures may provide frontal exposure of
nature to patients in a supine position. Research found that such positive distractions significantly 
improved patients’ satisfaction with the room environment and reduced their blood pressure levels 
(Pati et al. 2014). Data also showed the potential benefits of this intervention in reducing anxiety, 
pain, and medication use (Pati et al. 2016a). Nurses’ exposure to nature views (through windows

accessible from work areas) was associated with significant reductions in acute stress and increases 
in alertness (Zadeh et al. 2014). In addition, the visual appeal (i.e., attractiveness) of the built 
environment was found to impact a healthcare facility’s public image and make it easy to recruit 
physicians and other staff members (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016). 
Furthermore, research is beginning to shed light on other visual design topics. For example, a 
team led by Pati et al. (2016b) examined the effects of curved and pointed sharp-angled features in
healthcare building images on fear responses as measured by amygdala activation in fMRI brain 
scans and self-reported preferences of healthy adults. Overall, the study participants reported high 
preferences for images with curved objects. However, brain scans indicated significantly higher fear 
response associated with curve contours in healthcare interiors (Pati et al. 2016b).
Audio Environment 
In busy environments like an ICU, noise is a serious problem that causes sensory overload, stress, 
sleep disruptions, dissatisfaction, interferences with oral communication, and low work efficiency 
(Devlin and Arneill 2003). Effective noise reduction measures include the use of sound-absorbing 
materials such as carpets in patient rooms and corridors, and the location of potential noise sources, 
such as paper towel dispensers and ice machines, away from the patient rooms (Devlin and Arneill 
2003; Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). One effective example of patient 
room design for noise reduction included a “technical corridor” behind the patient head to house 
noise-generating medical equipment with a sound-blocking wall between the space and patient 
head; the environmental modification significantly reduced ICU room noise level, especially at
night (Luetz et al. 2016). In addition to noise reduction, the audio environment can be improved 
through the provision of relaxing music and nature sounds (Devlin and Arneill 2003; Ulrich et al. 
2008). Patient control of environmental elements, such as television volumes, may enhance the 
sense of control—a central component of patient-centered care (Devlin and Arneill 2003).
Wayfinding System 
The difficulty in finding one’s way without getting lost has been a chronic problem in healthcare 
facilities that are typically large and complex. The wayfinding issues may cause stress, frustration, 
and fatigue in patients and visitors as well as waste in staff time due to late or missed 
appointments. Pati et al. (2015) conducted a qualitative study to identify key physical
environment elements that may play a critical role in assisting wayfinding. Ten adults were 
instructed to complete simulated wayfinding tasks in hospitals. Data was collected through 
questionnaire surveys, verbal protocols that aimed at catching every thought occurring during 
navigation, and verbal directions provided by staff members. The study identified a set of
wayfinding design elements, including the following (Pati et al. 2015): 
▪ Signs, including the labels of rooms or spaces, directional signs, and any images, logos, 
or symbols indicating space functions 
▪ Information cues provided by architectural features, including views of exterior and 
multilevel interior views provided by atriums 
▪ Maps illustrating the global structure of the building 
▪ Logical clustering of spaces with related functions (e.g., entrance and admissions) 
▪ Furniture that may suggest the functions of spaces 
▪ Interior elements (artwork, display boards, information counters, wall color, vending 
machine, etc.) that could serve as familiarity markers of the anchor points 
These recommendations are consistent with those of other relevant research studies (e.g., 
Devlin 2014).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
Patient Room
One hot debate topic in healthcare design is whether patients should be cared in single-bed units 
or open bays. Research has strongly recommended single-bed patient rooms because of the 
associated benefits in communication, infection prevention, noise reduction, sleep quality, and 
patient and family experiences (Taylor, Card, and Piatkowski 2018). 
Beyond the issue of single-bed versus multibed rooms, research has also looked into other topics 
such as the relationships between different components of a patient room. In a simulation study of two 
ICU mock-up rooms, Chisholm et al. (2008) identified several design considerations: (1) using ceilingmounted articulating arms (i.e., booms) that provided easy access to outlets and equipment and at the 
same time reduced clutter, (2) positioning the patient monitors to improve visibility and usability, (3)
maximizing clearance around the bed to increase accessibility of equipment and avoid collisions, and 
(4) using easy-to-use intercom systems to facilitate communication between nurse stations and ICU 
rooms. Similarly, the size of spaces (e.g., patient room size, doorway width) was perceived by hospital 
administrators as an important factor that impacted healthcare safety and work efficiency (Pati, Gaines, 
and Valipoor 2016). Adequate spaces should be provided for the use and storage of all equipment that 
may be used in intensive care (e.g., physiologic monitoring, ventilator) (Department of Veterans 
Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012).
In another study, Pati et al. (2009) examined the importance of various patient room layout 
design elements as perceived by nine designers and five nondesigners (clinicians, patient, family 
member, nursing educator). The top-ranked design considerations included spatial clearance 
around bed, access to patient (including patient’s head), staff’s visibility to patient, unobstructed 
and quick path for staff to access patient from corridor, and patient access to bathroom. The 
fourteen participants were then instructed to rate six room configurations that varied on three key 
design variables: same-handedness (i.e., same-handed vs. mirrored layout), the location of
bathroom in relation to the exterior wall and corridor (i.e., outboard, inboard, and a combination 
of the two), and the location of bathroom in relation to the patient (i.e., footwall vs. headwall). 
The results showed that outboard and footwall bathroom locations were rated relatively higher 
than other options (Pati et al. 2009). 
To examine the environmental factors contributing to falls, Pati et al. (2018) analyzed the 
videotapes of 180 trials in which subjects were instructed to act as patients and perform scripted 
tasks of unassisted ambulation (e.g., walking from bed to bathroom) in a physical mock-up of
patient room. The coding of video data showed that certain actions (e.g., turning, pulling, pushing, 
bending forward, grabbing, and sitting) contributed to fall initiation. The following physical 
environment elements might impact the likelihood of engaging in the aforementioned high-risk 
actions and contribute to falls: (1) bathroom door type and direction of swing, (2) bathroom layout 
(e.g., spatial relationships between door, toilet, and sink), (3) hardware design (e.g., door, toilet), 
(4) clearance within the clinician zone, and (5) clearance around patient bed (e.g., spatial 
relationships between bed, chair, overbed table, and bathroom door) (Pati et al. 2018). 
Additionally, the installation of video surveillance systems in patient rooms might be an effective 
fall-reduction intervention (Cournan, Fusco-Gessick, and Wright 2018). 
The safety and efficiency of intensive care could potentially be improved through 
standardization on the basis of lessons learned from other industries. While standardization may 
occur at a wide range, from furniture or equipment to the whole unit, same-handed room 
represents an example of standardization at the level of patient room design. Pati et al. (2010) 
further examined the effects of the same-handed room concept in a simulated study, during which 
the activities of twenty registered nurses performing tasks (i.e., taking vitals, suctioning, sitting 
up patients) on a patient-actor were videotaped and analyzed. However, data provided little
support to the notion that nurses should consistently position on the patient’s right side. It was 
suggested that same-handed room configurations might not lead to more standardization in
process and workflow than the standard mirrored design of patient rooms (Pati et al. 2010).

THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN 
Biomechanics data from the same study indicated that 87 percent of the harmful and stressful 
actions (e.g., twisting, bending) during nursing care were associated with the use of equipment 
(e.g., bed, headwall); only 13 percent were related to room configuration issues (e.g., location of
IV pole, approach direction). This finding suggested that room layout standardization alone might 
not effectively improve the biomechanics of nursing care, and consequently, may be limited in
reducing the risk of staff back and musculoskeletal injuries (Pati et al. 2012). Another recent study 
showed several benefits of same-handed room, including lower noise, better sleep, and higher 
satisfaction; however, other differences between the same-handed rooms and the mirrored rooms 
were not controlled in the study (Watkins et al. 2011). 
Family Support Spaces 
Patient rooms are where visiting family members spend the most time with patients to provide 
physical, emotional, and social support. According to a questionnaire survey conducted by Philips 
(2012), the interactions between patients and their families would be enhanced through the 
provision of seating and sleeping accommodations, personal storage spaces, shelving to display 
personal items (e.g., gifts, flowers), accessible lighting and television, sound-absorbing finish 
materials, and appropriate furniture design (e.g., movable chairs) in the patient and family zones 
that supported family–patient interactions (Philips 2012). Similarly, interviews with four families 
of pediatric patients at CICUs and ICUs revealed several design recommendations to support 
families: layout that allowed easy communication between family and patient (e.g., shorter 
distance, direct visual contact); movable furniture (e.g., chair, overbed table); dedicated shower 
and toilet so families could stay close to patients; noise and light control (e.g., blocking of light 
from corridor, removing alarms from rooms); access to electric outlets, wireless connection, 
television, and other technology; and a communication board with plenty of information for 
families (Evans and Thomas 2011). Additional amenities for families should be provided in the 
unit. These amenities could include family lounge near patient rooms, communication 
technology, consultation rooms, meditation spaces, sleeping rooms, nourishment, bathrooms, and 
family laundry (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). 
Staff Support Spaces 
The decentralized nursing model is designed to bring nurses and supplies closer to patients by
distributing multiple nurse workstations across one unit. It is believed that decentralization may help 
improve visibility for patient monitoring and assistance as well as reduce staff walking distance, and 
therefore, increase the proportion of time spent by nurses in direct patient care. However, research 
on the decentralized design has reported mixed results. For example, a study found that nurses spent 
more time on administrative tasks (e.g., charting) but also engaged in more social interactions and 
consulting with other clinicians in units with centralized workstation design (Zborowsky et al. 
2010). In a before–after study, nurses spent less time in fetching supplies, and therefore, worked 
more efficiently after they moved from nursing units with centralized nurse stations to new units 
with decentralized nurse stations, but their walking distance increased and the self-reported 
collaboration level decreased (Pati et al. 2015). Other empirical studies showed similar patterns: 
decentralized nursing stations tended to improve patient experience but impede nurse teamwork 
(Fay, Cai, and Real 2019). Another study reported that the centralized design interfered with 
communication between staff and access to patients (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016). Because of
the mixed results associated with decentralized design, researchers explored other design options. 
For example, a recent study evaluated the effects of a “multihub” design that combined central 
nursing hubs and decentralized charting alcoves (Hua et al. 2012). Although patient satisfaction 
appeared to increase after the movement from hospital units with centralized or decentralized 
designs to the “multihub” unit, nurse satisfaction and nurse communication with physicians failed 
to improve or even declined (Hua et al. 2012).

ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH
According to reports from healthcare managers and frontline staff members, additional 
design features that support staff work include adequate spaces for the storage, use, and 
movement of equipment; ergonomic design (e.g., ceiling lift) that reduces risk of injury and 
improves efficiency; and an in-unit staff break room that is visually appealing (Pati et al. 2014). 
Additionally, there should be on-call spaces for staff to take short naps and sleep breaks, 
restrooms, and lockers next to the staff break room (Thompson et al. 2012). Adequate spaces 
should be provided for housekeeping rooms, clean workrooms, and soiled workrooms 
(Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). 
Integration of Multiple Design Features and Organizational Factors 
Healthcare outcomes represent consequences of the interactions between many factors from various 
domains, including environmental design, operations, culture, and finance (Pati 2020; Ulrich et al. 
2010). Through semistructured interviews, gaming, and shadowing, Pati et al. (2012) examined the 
organizational factors that impacted design decisions around flexibility (e.g., decentralized design, 
visibility). These factors included performance benchmarks, information technology, regulations, 
staff’s reluctance to adopt new technology, doctors’ expectations, human factors (e.g., perception, 
cognition), and financial factors (e.g., capital and personnel costs). A systematic approach that 
integrates all these factors (e.g., efficiency benchmarks for pharmacy, materials, and nursing unit) and 
design considerations (e.g., locations of nurse supplies) should be used to achieve the best possible 
outcomes (Pati et al. 2012). It has been recommended that multivariate models such as moderator and 
mediator models (i.e., models that include variables that impact or explain the relationship between a 
predictor and an outcome) should be developed and tested to optimize multifaceted solutions (Pati 
2020). A series of design tools (e.g., balanced scorecard, process analysis) can be used in the nonlinear 
iterative design process to discover the best options (Joseph et al. 2012).
The design of an ICU involves careful consideration of all key decision variables and 
constraints, such as model of care, service lines, budget, and existing structures. These 
considerations form the basis for determining the relatively higher priority goals for a building 
project and resolving possible conflicts between different design features. Ritchey and Pati (2008)
proposed a structured decision-making approach that aimed at balancing various goals and finding 
the “sweet spot” or the best design solution. They recommende"

The museum, located on the grounds of what had been the Hospital Minero (Mining Hospital), was a building complex conceived, built, and operationalized at the height of Mexico’s Industrial Revolution and the region’s only medical facility specializing in the healthcare needs of miners and their families. Utilizing historical analysis, the hospital reveals contradictions frequently embodied by the era’s Modernist built environments. Inaugurated in 1907, the hospital was the culmination of the United States Smelting Refining and Mining Company (USSRMC) and its Mexican subsidiary, Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca’s (CRMyP) efforts to bring healthcare to its employees while maximizing production.

All rights reserved.","The Hospital Minero (Miner Hospital) in Real del Monte, 
in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico), is a building complex 
conceived, built, and operationalized at the height 
of Mexico’s Industrial Revolution. Utilizing historical 
analysis, the hospital reveals contradictions frequently 
embodied by the era’s Modernist built environments. On 
one hand, the hospital’s design and operation expressed 
an optimism wrought by the dissemination of positivist 
and utilitarian philosophies and economic growth 
spurred by technological innovation; on the other hand, 
the design expressed growing wealth inequality and 
deteriorating, often brutal, labor conditions. Nearly 120 
years later, the hospital once again embodies its global 
reality. In contemporary post-industrialist economies, 
once these built environments cease being productive, 
they are abandoned or demolished; only a few are 
transformed and repositioned for other uses. Most 
recently, the Miner Hospital, an architectural expression 
which fused global and local economic, technological, 
and aesthetic sensibilities, was transformed into the 
Museum of Labor Medicine (Museo de Medicina 
Laboral), an example of didactic heritage.
On February 12, 1906, the United States Smelting 
Refining and Mining Company (USSRMC) purchased 
the Compañia Real del Monte y Pachuca’s (CRMyP), its 
mines and claims, marking a convergence of specific 
geographic conditions, and hundreds of years of 
geopolitical and economic factors. Located in Hidalgo, 
CRMyP was the latest acquisition in a global purchasing 
spree that included mining interests in Peru, Russia, 
Canada, and across the United States. Optimistic 
about the company’s financial future because of newly 
introduced technology, particularly electrically powered 
machinery, the company began operations by replacing 
outdated technology and reducing dependency 
on human labor. Consequently, mine productivity 
dramatically increased; however, so did the number of 
miners brutally injured or killed during work shifts. 
Immersed in the period’s sociopolitical and economic 
tensions, the USSRMC and local miners sought a 
reconciliatory approach, partnering to build a then 
state-of-the-art hospital, Hospital Minero de Real del 
Monte, to serve the miners’ medical needs. Nearly 100 
years later, after being abandoned, the hospital became 
part of Mexico’s tangible heritage when it was converted 
into a didactic museum, the Museo de Medicina Laboral 
(Museum of Labor Medicine). Today, visitors to the 
museum can not only learn about Mexico’s mining 
history, early twentieth-century medical technology, 
and the brutal conditions that helped give birth to the 
country’s labor rights movement, but also confront the 
contradiction between Modernism’s promise of progress 
and the realities wrought by scientific innovation and a 
market-driven global economy. 
1.2. Development Plan
First, the essay situates the hospital within a 
philosophical, sociopolitical, and economic context 
across a regional and global scale. It includes Real del 
Monte’s geography, mining legacy and cultural history, 
to explain how the hospital was conceived at the height 
of the region’s mining productivity. Subsequently, the 
essay analyzes the development of the hospital’s design, 
construction, and operation to demonstrate how the 
hospital revealed, and later the museum’s curated 
collection (including the buildings themselves) exhibits, 
various Modernist ideas derived from Modernism. Next, 
the case study documents within a larger sociopolitical 
and economic context, why the hospital, was first 
ceded to the public sector, then abandoned, and finally 
transformed into a museum. Currently, as part the 
region’s built heritage, the museum maintains itself by 
commodifying a historical narrative forged by globally 
influenced, but site-specific, regional economic realities. 
1.3. Theoretical Framework
This essay utilizes Perry Anderson’s argument that 
Modernism is not defined by a singular philosophy 
or aesthetic approach, but rather as a historical 
movement that disrupted older sociocultural norms 
and possessed a sense of urgency (1984, 112-13). One 
strain of Modernism, rooted in French positivism and 
British utilitarianism philosophies, promoted rationalist 
scientific processes to identify and address a range of 
social, economic, and technological challenges. For its 
part, Modernist architecture “grappled” with this strain 
of Modernism, by engaging in its “discourse” through 
spatial expressions (Goldhagen 2005, 145). 
As countries embraced, or were subjected to, globalized 
trade and industrialization, these philosophies, 
generating Modernist built environments across the 
world, like the hospital, which embodied the era’s 
zeitgeist and its intrinsic aporic contradictions. Because 
as Sophie Forgan argues museum “[b]uildings are 
artefacts in themselves, created at considerable expense 
and reflecting the intellectual and material context of 
the society in which they were founded,” it is possible 
to examine the museum’s spatial identity through a 
material culture lens (2005, 574). Where spatial identity 
is a “perceived image” produced by aesthetic and 
functional characteristics, which generate recognizable 
spatial expressions (Rogers, Castree, and Kitchin 2013). 
Today’s museum, seen as an iteration of a continuous 
spatial history, memorializes multiple, but convergent, 
spatial identities: site specific conditions, i.e., climate, 
topography, and geology, informed by local, regional, 
and global, technological, sociopolitical, and economic

forces, to produce a built environment that embodied 
its then contradictory realities. Today, the museum is 
part of the region’s tangible heritage precisely because 
visitors can experience how the hospital embodied, and 
now the museum exhibits, Modernism’s aporic zeitgeist.
1.4. Methodology
The essay examines the Museo de Medicinal Laboral as 
a case study that cross-references quantitative data, i.e., 
mining production and market values, with qualitative 
spatial analyses. Methodologies include the use of 
primary and secondary sources: Primary research was 
undertaken through on-site visits and consultation 
of primary ¬¬¬documentation, i.e., cotemporaneous 
periodicals, advertisements, corporate prospectuses, 
financial reports, trade journals, and other archival 
sources associated with the historic period. In addition, 
museum patrons and staff, including those who oversee 
its day-to-day operations, as well as members of the 
Archivo Histórico y Museo de Minería, Asociación Civil 
(AHMMAC), were interviewed. Secondary sources 
include peer-reviewed journal articles, booklets, books, 
blogs, contemporary newspaper articles, and other 
published material focused on the museum.
2. CONTEXT
2.1. Geography
To fully understand how a mining hospital embodies a 
confluence of geographic, economic, social, and political 
forces, it is important to examine the local, regional, and 
national context in which the hospital was conceived. 
The establishment of Real del Monte (hereafter Real) 
about 70 km northeast of Mexico City, can be traced 
to mining-related activities during the pre-Hispanic 
period.1
 The town’s approximately 11,150 residents live 
nestled in the Sierra Pachuca Range, situated 2,718 m 
above sea level, where temperatures occasionally dip 
below 0˚C generating light, but infrequent, snowfall 
during the winter, in a transitional area between 
the western slopes of the mineral-rich Sierra Madre 
Oriental and the eastern edge of the Central Mexican 
Plateau (PueblosAmerica 2022, para. 1) (Figure 1). Like 
the rest of Hidalgo, Real and its surrounding region lacks 
significant groundwater sources. Though rainfall can 
be acutely heavy, it is highly sporadic and confined to 
the summer months. Thus, major hydraulic, food and 
power infrastructure was required for a larger longterm population settlement. Real’s biome is typical 
of a transitional topography with xeriscapes hosting 
depleted forests. Over the last 500 years, surrounding 
forests were directly decimated by the mining industry 
which used wood for construction materials, i.e., mine 
rafters and wall blocking, and for fuel; and indirectly, by 
1 Officially renamed Mineral del Monte after Mexico’s 
independence in 1821.
using wood in the construction of the town’s changing 
built environment as it accommodated changes in urban 
scale, physiognomy, and morphology. 
2.2. Pre-Hispanic and Viceregal Era
Real’s region was a well-known mountain pass utilized 
by several Mesoamerican cultures, including the 
Toltecs, Chichimecs, and Otomí. The Otomí christened 
the area Maghotsi, or Paso Alto (High Pass), because it 
was routinely used to cross from the Gulf of Mexico’s 
coast to the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlan (Gobierno 
del Estado de Hidalgo 2010, 10). As early as 1324, the 
Chichimecs were mining silver and other minerals 
throughout the Sierra Pachuca area (7). 
In 1531, ten years after the Spanish conquered the 
Mexica Empire, the Spanish Crown officially recognized 
the region’s potential mineral wealth and placed the 
region and its inhabitants directly under the Crown’s 
purview, thereby acquiring the Real (Royal) name. Then 
in 1552, Alonso Pérez de Zamora, a former soldier in 
Hernán Cortés’ army, began mining operations; and 
shortly after, in 1555, Bartolomé de Medina would 
perfect the mercury-based “patio” method for silver and 
gold extraction, greatly increasing yields (Mendizábal 
1941, 255). 
2.3. Foreign Investment
Like most newly incorporated innovative technologies, 
initial applications maximized yields, even for 
mines previously considered exhausted; yet, like 
all technologically driven cycles, subsequent yields 
inevitably dropped as technology reached extraction 
capacity limit. Real was a profitable mining region during 
the Viceregal period, especially after 1750, when owner 
Pedro de Romero and Terreros (1710-81) introduced

new water-management techniques that generated a 
silver mining bonanza. Significantly, in 1766, the first 
labor strike erupted in New Spain when miners led by 
Nicolás Zavala (the museum’s cultural center namesake) 
protested unfair wages and working conditions. Only 
with Viceroy Joaquín de Montserrat’s (in office 1760-
66) direct intervention did miners return to work. By the 
last years of the eighteenth century, however, the mines 
had been abandoned, as decreasing profits no longer 
justified operational costs (Mendizábal 1941, 305). 
In 1824, when the Mexican government allowed 
for foreign investment, the British Real del Monte 
Company, based out of London, purchased the Romero 
de Terreros’ mines and claims and established the 
Compañía de Aventureros de las Minas de Pachuca y 
Real del Monte in Mexico. British investors, engineers, 
administrators, and miners, most hailing from Cornwall, 
sought to apply cutting-edge steam-powered mining 
technology to exploit Real’s mines. From 1824 to 
1849, the British invested 16 million dollars to produce 
11 million dollars of market-value ore. Arguably, the 
venture failed because of a strained relationship with 
the Federal government, six crippling labor strikes, 
expensive equipment, e.g., Cornish pumps “worth their 
weight in silver,” costly infrastructure improvements 
including supply and distribution roads, rail lines, and 
lower than expected yields (West 1907, 14). A year after 
the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the British 
company sold their interests to a Mexican venture, 
the Sociedad Aviadora de Minas de Real del Monte 
y Pachuca (CRMyP’s precursor) and abandoned the 
country (Randall 1985, 629). 
Despite the British corporation’s withdrawal, H.E. 
West in 1907, noted in The Mexican Mining Journal 
that the British had introduced the region to “modern 
times” (West 1907, 14). The British had, in fact, deeply 
influenced local society and its culture: families like 
the Rule, Straffon, and Ludlow, stayed and integrated 
themselves into local politics, industry, and commerce; 
British workers introduced Cornish pasties (meat pies), 
known in Mexico as pastes, to local cuisine; soccer began 
as a local pastime, but eventually became the national 
sport; and Protestantism, the prevalent faith among the 
Cornish, gained a toehold in a predominantly Roman 
Catholic country. Much of Real’s urban physiognomy 
changed because Cornish builders introduced doublepitched cottages roofed with red-painted corrugated 
iron metal sheets (Figures 2 & 3). Today, because 
of the architectural influence of Cornish vernacular 
architecture, Real has been dubbed “little Cornwall” 
(Cooper-Richet 2017).
2.4. Confluence of Local, Regional and Global Forces
The Miner Hospital represents the culmination of 
globalized sociopolitical and economic forces. After 
Mexican independence was finally consolidated in 
1821, unceasing political instability led to internal 
insurrections, coups de etas, and frequent civil wars 
that continuously undermined the nascent state. A 
politically weak Mexico was constantly engaged in civil 
conflict, and an easy target for foreign interventionism, 
expansionism and coerced territorial secession. e.g., 
Texas Revolutionary War (1835-36) and the MexicanAmerican War (1846-48). Significantly, conflicts drained 
the Mexican treasury, reduced natural resources, and 
further frustrated Mexico’s political development. With 
each devastating setback, the divide widened between 
those seeking a modernized state and those seeking to 
conserve the status quo. 
In 1857, a liberal constitution was adopted that enabled 
social reforms and overhauled the country’s legal 
framework, which included ceding mining regulations 
to states to provide the legal certainty needed to attract 
foreign investment (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 26). 
Then, in 1858 Benito Juárez, a liberal, was elected 
president. He pledged to enact significant legislation 
furthering political reforms codified by the Constitution 
of 1857, which sparked yet another civil war, the 1858-
61 Guerra de Reforma (Reform War). Exploiting Mexico’s 
weakened state, France successfully invaded Mexico 
in 1861 and imposed an Austro-Hungarian Habsburg, 
Maximilian I, as its Second Emperor of Mexico (1864-
67). Eventually, President Benito Juárez led a loyal liberal 
army and expelled the Europeans. During the relatively 
brief French occupation contemporary European 
philosophies and technology deeply influenced leading 
Mexican intellectual, military, political, and industrialist

figures, which became convinced that only transforming 
Mexico into a strong, sovereign, and modern nation, 
could prevent future calamities. 
2.5. Modernism and The Porfiriato
It is perhaps a historical irony that Porfirio Diaz, a former 
general who helped expel the French in 1867, turned 
to Europe, especially France, to model his government’s 
approach to Mexico’s modernization. While Modernism 
includes a multitude of overlapping paradigms, Mexico’s 
political, economic, and cultural development during 
Diaz’s administration were primarily influenced by two 
central ideas of European philosophical Modernism: 
August Comte’s positivism and John Stuart Mill’s 
utilitarian philosophy. 
Comte’s positivism held at its central promise “the 
formation of the new social system” (Comte 1998, 52). 
Positivism’s promise, it seemed, was reciprocated by 
market-driven innovation as entrepreneurs, scholars, 
and government officials, began to benefit from 
the Scientific Revolution’s ongoing contributions: 
technological advances spurred on innovation across 
industry, producing immense wealth among the 
growing European bourgeoisie classes. Economically 
liberalized states and their capitalist classes, enamored 
with positivism and Mill’s utilitarianist free-market 
approach, extracted wealth from labor and invested 
heavily in technologically driven market advantages. 
Eventually, after the initial industrialization boom, for 
many European countries economic growth would not 
be found in internal markets, but in financially favorable 
globalized resource extraction and trade. Inspired by

France and its globalized influence, by the nineteenth 
century’s last third Diaz’s government deployed 
positivism and utilitarianism to administer the country 
systematically. 
By the early 1890s, a group of positivist scientists, 
doctors, scholars, and bureaucrats, collectively known 
as the “Cientίficos” (Scientists), formed the core of 
Diaz’s politico-administrative State apparatus (María y 
Campos 1991, 125). By 1900, the government adopted 
the positivist motto “Order and Progress” (Comte 
2020, 55). Diaz’s administration, initially 1877-80, and 
continuously from 1884 to1911, utilized legal reforms 
enabled by the 1857 Constitution that “crystallized the 
laissez-faire trends begun by Benito Juárez” (Alvarez 
1987, 29). During his administration
the government encouraged foreign investment 
as its principal development policy. In addition 
to the problem of capital, Mexico also lacked 
the technical knowledge to promote the 
development and production of her economy. 
Díaz, who favored the development of the nation 
by the economically powerful, encouraged 
foreign investment through legal statutes that 
leaned heavily in favor of foreigners. (Alvarez 
1987, 29)
As a result, at first Diaz’s government successfully 
stabilized the country politically while achieving 
economic growth across all economic sectors—though 
not among all socioeconomic groups. However, no 
industry was more heavily favored than mining. Early 
in 1884, Diaz successfully promoted new legislation 
that brought much-needed legal and investment 
certainty to the mining industry, generating a flood 
of foreign investment into the sector (Kuntz Ficker 
2010, 166). Soon, other industries were reformed 
prompting additional foreign capital across all economic 
sectors. Mexico’s growing industrialist and middle 
class experienced impressive economic benefits. John 
Coatsworth remarks that 
Between 1877 and 1910 national income per 
capita grew at an annual average rate of 2.3 
percent, extremely rapid growth by world 
standards, so fast indeed that per capita income 
more than doubled in thirty-three years. (1978, 
81)
Steven Bunker further notes that Mexico’s emergent 
middle and upper classes’ “participation in this market 
exchange signified being part of Mexico’s modernization 
efforts” (1997, 228).
The Porfiriato, as the Diaz era is dubbed, forever changed 
the country’s architectural, urban, sociopolitical, and 
economic landscape (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 37). 
Burgeoning globalized demand for goods and services 
prompted more foreign investment in Mexico, which 
produced Modernist built environments, e.g., the 
hospital, to systematically meet new market demands. 
Economic success, however, came at a high social cost. 
In Germany, for example, social problems generated by 
industrialization and uneven wealth distribution were 
severe enough that, at the insistence of Chancellor Otto 
von Bismarck, it “became the first nation in the world to 
adopt an old-age social insurance program in 1889” (SSA, 
n.d.). More broadly, while Europe’s nineteenth century 
industrial and scientific development lead to impressive 
economic growth, it also generated socioeconomic 
problems leading to social unrest, revolutions, and 
continental war, e.g., 1848 and 1870-71. 
Similarly, Mexico’s economic success belied significant 
growing social and political problems as newly 
produced wealth became concentrated among foreign 
enterprises, national companies, relatively few families, 
and investment syndicates; equally contradictory, 
the modernization process produced mass rural 
migration to cities, where the impoverished urban 
population experienced deplorable living and working 
conditions. Moreover, far from producing a long-term 
stable and politically democratic state, the Porfiriato 
often undergirded its interests by frequently using 
violent force to support foreign investors, national 
political bosses, and business cronies—all ostensibly 
justified by advances in telecommunications, rail, port 
infrastructure, manufacturing, and a globally integrated 
banking system. Like Europe, Mexico’s successful 
industrialization and global market integration, 
generated latent aporias which became evident with 
the Miner Hospital.
Growing sociopolitical and economic discontent, 
already evident in the early 1890s, came to a head in 
the Mexican Revolution (c.1910-20) when peasants, 
farmers, and the working classes grew despondent 
as living conditions deteriorated (Tutino 2018, 174). 
Despite brutally suppressed labor strikes, especially 
in mining, the Revolution, political instability, and 
industrialized profits made Mexico an attractive mining 
region throughout the first half of the twentieth century. 
3. CONFLUENCE OF MODERNISM’S FORCES
3.1. Conception
With Mexico fully vested in attracting foreign 
investment, the United States Smelting Refining and 
Mining Company (USSRMC) incorporated in January 
1906 “to acquire other mining interests in Mexico and 
Nevada” (Strack, n.d., under “Overview”) Five days 
after the acquisition, the Mexican Herald (published 
in English) reported on February 17 that “[USSRMC] 
26
ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023
http://www. arcc-journal.org
intend putting into the company several million dollars 
into opening the mines, building mills, and in new 
equipment” (Mexican Herald 1906a, 7). Shortly after 
the purchase, the USSRMC executed its ambitious 
business plan. Confidently applying innovative electric 
technology, throughout 1906, the company rapidly 
replaced outdated British mining machines to ramp up 
yields at Real’s mines. 
In April, USSRMC purchased 4000 hp from the Canadianowned Mexican Light and Power Company (Mexican 
Herald 1906d, 1) and proceeded to build over 8000 
km of infrastructure tunnels to bring electricity to Real, 
and the entire region, to provide enough power for the 
mining equipment (Mota 2018). Through the end of 
1909, the company had installed nine electric winches, 
ranging between 110 and 250 hp, and compressors in 
each of its Real mines (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez 
Badillo 2005, 10). The combination of electric machinery 
and the newly perfected silver cyanidation process in 
1907, resulted in tremendous success: while in 1906 
USSRMC achieved just over 3.5 million dollars in net 
earnings, by 1910 it reported 3.74 million dollars in net 
earnings; its 7 percent preferred stock and 4 percent 
common stock yields easily surpassing expectations 
(Stevens 1911, 1737-38). 
Despite The Mexican Mining Journal’s assurance that 
“the successful operation of this big company on 
modern lines will prove undoubtedly of such benefit to 
the camp that those who have criticized will shortly be 
praising [emphasis added]” (Historic and Famous 1907, 
17): similar to the Porfiriato’s internalized sociopolitical 
contradictions, USSRMC’s mining success would reduce 
employment opportunities, and ultimately lead to a 
deadly toll on miners. The initial suspension of most 
mining activity, combined with workers replaced by “the 
latest and best machinery available” (Mexican Herald 
1906c, 11), led the USSRMC to lay off hundreds of 
miners; over 400 left the region to find work elsewhere 
causing generalized “misery” (El Pais 1906, 3; Mexican 
Herald 1906b, 11). As Alan Derickson observes
More than any other factor, the hazards 
of the job drove hardrock miners to create 
and maintain health and welfare programs. 
Accidents crippled and killed countless workers. 
Debilitating industrial diseases took a heavy 
toll. Industrialization exacerbated old risks and 
generated new ones. In particular, silicosis 
became rampant in the wake of the technological 
revolution of the late nineteenth century. (1988, 
30)
To be sure, new technology reduced certain mining 
risks but generated others, often with more severe 
adverse outcomes. For example, “[t]he introduction of 
electric locomotives […] meant that workers traded the 
risk of being kicked by mules for the increased risk of 
being squashed against mine walls by large engines” 
(Derickson 1988, 32).
Then, a significant mining event over 2,000 km away 
shook the North American mining industry. On June 1, 
1906, Mexican workers at the Cananea copper mine 
in Sonora, Mexico, went on strike demanding the 
Mexico-based US-owned Cananea Consolidated Copper 
Company end deteriorating labor conditions that had 
significantly increased casualties and establish wage 
parity. The company’s owner, William Cornell Greene, 
and Mexican government officials were unmoved by 
the miners’ demands. Mexican federal and local police, 
soldiers, company staff, and Arizona Rangers crossed 
the international border with the permission of Sonora’s 
Governor Rafael Izábal, and proceeded to brutally 
suppress the strike, injuring hundreds, and killing thirty 
miners (Cárdenas García 1998, 144). Though the strike 
ended four days later, the strike’s aftereffects, factored 
into the 1907 U.S. financial crisis and fueled grievances 
that culminated in the Mexican Revolution. Other 
mining operations, like USSRMC at Real, took notice of 
the catastrophic results.
Aware of increasing numbers and severity of mining 
injuries, USSRMC elected a different path: rather than 
risk a generalized, highly disruptive labor strike and 
violence that could endanger future production, the 
company negotiated with mining leaders. In September 
1906, USSRMC’s upper management, namely its 
Mexican operations manager Morril Spaulding and chief 
medical officer A.J. Hoskins, met with Real’s Mayor, 
Agustίn Straffon, and mining leaders to propose the 
construction of a new hospital. The hospital was to be 
a cutting-edge medical facility, with medical staff, from 
doctors to nurses, focused on the miners’ specific needs. 
There were precedents for a company-operated mining 
hospital. In the United States, the Miner’s Hospital in 
Hazleton, Pennsylvania, opened in 1889; and the Ereğli 
Company hospital at Zonguldak in the Ottoman Empire 
opened in May 1897 (Quataert 2006, 192). In Mexico, 
however, this would be the first hospital of its kind. 
Arguably, building and operating a mining hospital was 
a win-win scenario for the company: on the one hand, 
by providing miners and their families with healthcare, 
they could demonstrate genuine concern for worker 
welfare; on the other hand, building the hospital would 
not only quell any discontent regarding a lack of medical 
attention but also facilitate faster recovery of a labor 
force that represented a vital company investment in 
training and experience. At the meeting, the parties 
agreed to jointly develop the hospital immediately 
so miners would receive the best care possible for 
mining-related injuries and, when possible, facilitate 
27
ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023

and supervise rehabilitation programs for the injured 
(AHCRdMyP, n.d., 1). 
To finance the hospital’s construction, equipment, 
and operation, the agreement called for the miners to 
contribute, and the company to match, a one-time fee 
of five Mexican cents and an ongoing fee of between 
2 percent and 4 percent of miners’ wages during 
construction (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez Badillo 
2005, 12). Hospital construction began in late 1906 
on a 3,926 m2 parcel that was eventually ceded in 
September of 1908 by the workers in exchange for the 
company’s continued maintenance of facilities and staff 
salaries (Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.). Belem Oviedo, head 
of the museum’s supervisory and administrative trust, 
notes that when the hospital was finished, it was “one 
of the most beautiful, modern, and functional hospital 
buildings of its era” (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez 
Badillo 2005, 12). Once in operation, the hospital was 
initially staffed by Hoskins, two assistant physicians (one 
Dr. Nájera, a Mexican national), a Matron (chief nurse), 
five assistant nurses, and a pharmacist. The first Matron, 
Nelly Zurhaar, arrived in 1907 from the Netherlands and 
would head the staff until her death in 1959. 
4. DESIGN STRATEGIES OF HOSPITAL MINERO
4.1. Architectural Zeitgeist
Little is known about the hospital’s designers, as the 
construction drawings were prepared by USSRMC 
engineers and signed by an “E. Islas.”2
 However, it is 
possible to gain some insight into the region’s design 
zeitgeist from contemporary newspapers. A German 
engineer, Ernesto Fuchs, who had emigrated to 
Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 1870s, had designed and 
was supervising to great acclaim the construction of the 
Bank of Hidalgo in Pachuca, the state’s capital (Figure 4). 
While the bank’s façade was an eclectic mix of European 
Neoclassical motifs and styles, Fuchs channeled the 
era’s emphasis on modernity, stating that the building 
“is entirely of steel and stone construction” and the 
“interior finishing of the building is in accordance 
with the most modern ideas [emphasis added]” 
(Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.).
4.2. The Hospital
The hospital embodied multiple ideas associated with 
nineteenth century Modernism; its existence evidenced 
Mexico’s globally driven industrialization and was 
conceived as part of an overall strategy to increase 
labor productivity. Positivism and utilitarianism had 
prompted typological evolution in response to empirical 
observations, a parti that prioritized functional 
processes over all other considerations, integration of 
the latest technology, and the use of globally fashionable 
or recently adopted pragmatic aesthetic vocabularies, 
e.g., red corrugated iron roofs, interpreted with local 
materials, to express a modern identity. 
Though there is evidence that hospitals have existed 
as a spatial typology since Mesopotamia or Dynastic 
Egypt, it would be in the nineteenth century that 
significant innovations transformed hospitals “from 
traditional charitable institutions […] to modern 
medical institutions” (Kisacky 2019, 288). Many of these 
innovations were proposed by an English nurse, Florence 
Nightingale, “the Angel of the Crimea.” After heavy 
losses by the British during the Crimean War (1856-58), 
Nightingale was dispatched to the Bosporus (Turkey) to 
improve conditions for wounded soldiers. Despite initial 
opposition from British doctors, Nightingale successfully 
reorganized the medical facilities and vastly reduced the 
mortality rate among the wounded.3
 She, and her team 
of nurses, were able to do so by introducing several key 
modifications to traditional hospital design and patient 
care that would later be evident in the design of Real’s 
mining hospital. In the spirit of positivism, Nightingale

3 At the time, reduction in the rate of mortality was 
consciously misreported by British authorities to increase moral 
among troops, however, actual mortality rate decreases were still an 
extraordinary achievement.

codified her design ideas in “Notes on Hospitals”, which 
became the international bible of late nineteenthcentury hospital design, correlated hospital mortality 
rates to hospital layouts as a means of assessing the 
healthiness of hospital building design” (Kisacky 2017, 
23). 
Real’s mining hospital displayed various avantgarde design strategies associated with Modernist 
architecture. The first of these characteristics was its 
siting: not only was the hospital conveniently located 
atop one the highest of Real’s urbanized hills and roughly 
equidistant to three major mine heads, but following 
Florence Nightingale’s guidelines, it was located outside 
of the town’s denser urban fabric, where patients could 
enjoy a quiet environment along with a continuous 
supply of fresh air to prevent airborne contagion 
(Kisacky 2017, 25). Moreover, its location followed 
the pattern where “smaller rural hospitals served a 
specific community in facilities that typically included 
only necessary medical spaces and technologies but 
provided more personalized care” (Kisacky 2019, 290). 
The hospital’s master plan (Figure 5), unchanged to 
this day, is composed of a courtyard surrounded by 
three individualized single-storied masses running 
east to west. In keeping with “the hospital designs of 
late eighteenth-century Europe,” the campus’ plan 
“maximized air flow and quality by structuring the 
hospital as a collection of small buildings, each filled 
with a narrow, linear room, disconnected from other 
spaces and surrounded by open air” (Kisacky 2017, 15)
The longest volume, nearly 60 m long, runs parallel to 
the aptly named Hospital Street on the campus’ ¬south 
side and is the hospital’s main public façade. Unlike the 
Bank, the use of Cantera (ash stone) was limited to an 
approximately 1.5 m tall base course (Figure 6). 
Above that, its upper molding band persists throughout 
the courtyard elevations but not the Cantera plaques. 
Above this base is a series of alternating orange brick 
and locally collected cobblestone bands, ending with 
concrete quoins that mark folding planes. These 
Romanesque-like striations, however, do not repeat 
in other façades. Instead, all other exterior facades 
are composed of vast cobblestone planes, interrupted 
by windows framed by dematerializing orange brick 
surrounds. The use of stone in this fashion was 
consistent with traditions brought by the Cornish. As 
Gerda Peterich notes, this type of cobblestone masonry 
originates 
in traditions of rubble wall techniques imported 
from Europe, particularly from England, where 
it served the demands of the pioneer farmers 
especially well, as the gathering of stones cleared

their fields, and the building material could be 
accumulated at convenient times […] (1956, 12)
The willful adoption of the foreign Byzantine-like façade 
striation, executed with local materials, suggests a 
global architectural outlook: the use of readily available 
cobblestone to build English-type walls, combined with 
the Cornish-type red corrugated iron roofs, points to a 
local re-interpretation of imported building traditions.
The street-facing massing has two entrances: the 
easternmost, a porte-cochere gate, is bounded to 
the north by a colonnade separating a roofed but 
horizontally open area from the courtyard beyond; to 
the west is the main or civic entrance, recognizable 
from the street by its large, horizontally protruding 
volume. From this civic entrance starts the campus’ 
main north-south organizational axis. Once past the 
main entrance doors, you arrive at an entrance hall. To 
the left of this hall were the kitchen, staff dining hall, 
pantry, storeroom, service quarters, and a pharmacy. To 
the right were consultation offices, a second pharmacy, 
three bedrooms with bathrooms, laundry facilities, and 
a boiler room. Past the entry hall, visitors are confronted 
with a proto-modernist spatial expression: exiting 
northward, visitors step down onto a ceramic-paved 
path bounded by rainwater runners that asymmetrically 
bifurcate a garden courtyard (Figure 7). 
The courtyard seems to deploy incipient Modernist 
ideas on healing spaces proposed by the late eighteenthcentury German landscape scholar Christian Cay Lorenz: 
The garden should be directly connected to 
the hospital [… ]A view from the window into 
blooming and happy scenes will invigorate the 
patient […] [and] encourages patients to take 
a walk […] The plantings should wind along 
dry paths, which offer benches […]The spaces 
between could have beautiful lawns and colorful 
flower beds […] A hospital garden should have 
everything to enjoy nature and to promote a 
healthy life. (quoted in Marcus and Sachs 2014, 
7)
Lorenz’s texts, widely translated across Europe by 
the end of the eighteenth century, were especially 
influential in England and France (Parshall 1993, 125). 
Following Nightingale’s suggestion, the hospital’s 
internal courtyard was relatively open to the east, bound 
only by a low-height property wall that ensured fresh air 
first circulated through the campus’ courtyard and then 
through the buildings’ windows and into the wards. 
The low wall height enabled morning sunshine to bathe 
the south-facing windows of the main patient wards. 
To the courtyard’s west, possibly placed to block the 
setting sun, was the Matron’s residence. Its bedroom, 
living room, kitchen, and dining room arranged in a 
Figure 6. The Main Facade, facing south along Hospital Street, photograph by Author.

ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023

“shotgun” architectural typology. Here, visitors glimpse 
a more modern aesthetic: Originally, the residence’s 
east façade was an evenly plastered wall, interrupted by 
two darkly framed windows and framed by two white 
pilasters with simplified bases and Doric-like capitals 
painted to contrast starkly (Figure 8). Now operating as 
a museum, the Matron’s residence’s east windows have 
been protected from the sun with an awning, while the 
façade exhibits cobblestones. Directly to the east, an 
octagonal fountain aligns axially with the residence’s 
east windows. At the eastern end of the courtyard was 
an area reserved for keeping live animals used to feed 
patients, the cook’s apartment, and storage facilities.
Finally, the hospital’s main wing, located at the north 
end of the north-south axis, housed the operative 
medical facilities and the patient wards. The hospital 
wards exemplified a
standardized design popularized worldwide by 
Florence Nightingale—which promised to make 
hospital buildings into places of cure rather than 
incubators of disease. Pavilion-ward hospital 
buildings included hygienic materials and details, 
large open wards, support spaces, and little else.

Like the Matron’s residence, the courtyard-facing 
elevation has been transformed. Though today the 
façade is dominated by cobblestone, as Figure 9 shows, 
this façade initially matched the Matron’s residence 
vocabulary: its evenly plastered walls, darkly painted 
window frames, bright white pilasters, punctuated by 
darkly painted capitals and bases that sit on the base 
trim, produced a striking contrast with the administrative 
wing’s cobblestone and brick façade. Entry to the 
principal branch is vertically highlighted by a protruding 
double-story volume with a two-pitched roof. 
The entry, formed by an archway surrounding a recessed 
neo-classical frieze and columns, houses a vestibule that 
doubled as a chapel (see Figure 7). Behind the chapel 
was the on-duty nurses’ station, another of Nightingale’s 
contributions to hospital design. As part of the lessons 
learned in the Crimean War, she had outlined the need 
for a centralized nursing station, from where nurses 
could supervise the wards and rush to assist a patient 
when necessary. Behind the entry vestibule and at 
the center of the main wing were bathing facilities, 
the assistant nurses’ bedrooms, laundry, and pressing 
facilities. Real’s hospital layout was more the result 
of empirical observation and the consideration of 
processes than strict precedent. As Annmarie Adams 
observes, architects after 1900
bolstered their architectural authority not 
through their experience building related 
institutions, but rather through their direct 
observation of medical practice. […] It was their 
special knowledge of the routines, needs, and 
procedures of specific departments that enabled 
them to master the complex programmatic 
requirements of the modern hospital. (2008, 
108)
According to Dr. Hoskins, two large wards, one to each 
side of the entry vestibule, housed twelve beds each 
(six to a long side) but could, if needed, be fitted with 
double that amount for a total of forty-eight beds 
(Figure 10) (Hoskins 1909, 38-42). It is possible that 
the two wards were spread out symmetrically from 
the vestibule and nurses’ area to avoid “the corridor 
system, with double wards on each side, and so no cross 
ventilation,” a spatial practice bemoaned by Nightingale 
(McDonald 2020, 31). Then, following the latest design 
thinking, users walked through the wards through a 
central corridor informally bounded by the patients’ 
beds. Kisacky suggests this was because later hospital 
designs considered “the theory of transmission by direct 
contact could have provided the basis for an alternate 
architectural model of hospital design, one that focused 
on controlling the movement and condition of persons 
and objects” (2017, 107). The inward direction beds 
faced was an expression of maximized administrative 
control and maintenance:
The narrow width and long walls full of windows 
maximized natural architectural ventilation and 
left no dark corners where patients could hide 
illicit behaviors. Having the patients face into the 
ward put the patient’s head adjacent to the supply 
of fresh air but also facilitated nurse supervision, 
allowed direct physical access to the patient 
on both sides for examination or treatment, 
and prevented the patient’s exhalations and 
excretions from coating the adjacent walls. 
(Kisacky 2017, 65)
The floors were made of light-colored cedar or maple 
wood, which would permit the detection of filth 
and reflect light from the windows and when in use, 
electrical light fixtures. Past the east patient ward 
was an x-ray room equipped with state-of-the-art

instruments (Figure 11) and the pharmacists’ lab (Figure 
12). The available x-ray equipment when the hospital 
opened in 1907 presents one of the clearest examples of 
Modernism’s contradictions (Gómez and Rodríguez-Paz 
2018). Throughout late nineteenth century Modernism, 
social reformers pushed for social engineering to prevent 
crime associated with impoverished workers had 
prioritized medical innovation: science and technology 
had made x-rays a valuable tool in healthcare. Yet, Real’s 
x-ray equipment was one of only a handful of machines 
found in all of Mexico at that time. In an era where so 
many governments boasted about social reform, the 
equipment had been purchased by the private mining 
company, for a specialized industry hospital, on the 
outskirts of a town with 12,251 total inhabitants in 1900 
(Secretaría 1902, table I). What mattered then was the 
capacity to continue to mine and produce ore; in that 
context, an x-ray machine was a wise investment.
To the west of the entrance vestibule, users entered 
a ward commonly used for rehabilitation. Past this 
ward, at the end of the wing, was the surgery suite and 
sterilization room equipped with the latest medical 
technology and tools. Finally, the hospital’s interiors 
were also the epitome of modern: ‘all the buildings are

Background: CAH intends to improve access to healthcare, coordinate with experts and providers, and serve as the rural population’s healthcare hub. It is imperative to understand environmental qualities that impact the quality of care to develop effective policies and design guidelines for rural healthcare. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies have focused on user or organizational outcomes related to the physical environment of rural healthcare settings. Methods: This cross-sectional exploratory qualitative case study was conducted as part of the facility planning process for a CAH in rural North Carolina. Hospital staff participated in a survey exploring their satisfaction with the overall physical environment privacy, space allocation, and department adjacency. An open-ended question asked staff to elaborate on needed improvements and changes in their department. Results: Findings show low satisfaction levels for space allocations for emergency department, lab, surgery, and wound care. Safety and quality were the two emerging outcomes of the physical environment’s shortcomings. Two clusters emerged from the content analysis, representing facility needs (rightly sized spaces, functional needs, COVID-19 needs, and improved access) and ambient conditions (clutter, visibility, flooring quality, noise, privacy, cleanliness, aesthetics, and temperature).

healthcare access for a rural population with
healthcare access inequities. Living in rural areas
of the United States associates with inferior
health outcomes, with a 40% higher preventable
hospitalization rate and a 23% higher mortality
rate than urban residents (Johnston et al., 2019).
Established disparities, such as longer driving distance to a hospital (Billi et al., 2007; Cai et al.,
2019) or lack of access to healthcare specialists,
have resulted in different health outcomes
between rural and urban areas (Brundisini et al.,
2013; Johnston et al., 2019). To bridge this gap,
CAH intend to improve access to healthcare,
coordinate with experts and providers, and serve
as the hubs of healthcare for the rural population
(The Rural Health Information Hub, 2022).
It is essential to improve the understanding of
environmental qualities that impact the quality of
care for developing effective policies and design
guidelines for rural healthcare. Current evidence
suggests physical environment is one of the factors affecting rural healthcare patient experience,
staff recruitment, patient participation, patient
satisfaction, processes, and staff satisfaction (Cai
et al., 2017, 2019; Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, &
Valipoor, 2016). Nevertheless, a limited number
of studies have focused on user or organizational
outcomes related to the physical environment of
rural healthcare settings (Cai et al., 2017, 2019;
Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, & Valipoor, 2016).
These studies recommend investigating rural care
teams’ perceptions of the potential relationships
between environmental variables.
Cai et al. (2017) study showed that existing
facilities need to be improved in providing
high-quality patient care satisfaction and staff
work experience. In another study, Cai et al.
(2019) survey of rural residents suggested the
topmost important environmental quality as privacy, adequate chairs in exam rooms for families,
and practical tools for information sharing and
communication between patients, families, and
clinicians. The research also found a correlation
between design features for an open counter to
communicate with the receptionists and simultaneously supporting patient privacy. The authors
also emphasize the need for patient privacy
support in exam rooms to discuss insurance information and financial implications, as such topics
are a paramount concern for rural residents.
Haddox et al. (2018) performed a pilot qualitative study on the elderly population of a rural outpatient clinic. The study found that lack of privacy
or confidentiality at check-in, clutter, seating proximity to contagious patients in waiting rooms, and
inadequate natural lighting in the reception and
exam rooms were some of the perceived barriers
to patient participation that may cause missing
appointments. Pati et al. (2016a) conducted an
explorative qualitative study of administrators of
four rural hospitals. The findings indicated that
older facilities were inadequate or unattractive
workspaces, negatively affecting efficiency,
safety, clinician specialist recruitment, staff morale, and patient perception of their local hospital
patient experience. Small operating rooms (OR)
needed more flexible teamwork space and
imposed equipment installation issues that
impacted surgeon recruitment. Laboratory, pharmacy, imaging, or radiology departments also
reported challenges such as the inadequate size
of space, configurations with improper adjacencies, or in demand for additional storage size.
These conditions negatively impacted operational
efficiency and safe delivery of care.
The focus of this exploratory study was to
address the following research questions: What is
the staff’s perception of the current obstacles and
needs relevant to the CAH’s infrastructure, physical
environment attributes, or ambient conditions?
Furthermore, why is improving and overcoming
these obstacles and needs essential? The underlying
frameworkinthis studyisthatthe facility design and
qualities of CAHs impact participant or organizational outcomes. Additionally, the study adds to the
limited body of knowledge on the impact of a pandemic on rural healthcare facility design. Finally,
this study aims to contribute to the evidence-based
design literature and inform decision makers of
future CAH design policy, practice, and research.
Method
This cross-sectional exploratory qualitative case
study was conducted as part of the facility
Zamani et al. 307
planning process for a CAH in rural North Carolina. The hospital was open to the rural county in
1930 and included specialties such as cardiology,
family practice, urgent care, wound care, orthopedic surgery, women’s health, and emergency
department (ED). Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2
explain critical department: Departmental Gross
Square Foot (DGSF) and room Square Footages
(SFs). The main hospital had two levels for a total
of 85,000 SF. Outpatient clinic buildings comprise seven detached buildings scaled between
1754 and 4201 (SF). An additional nursing center
department, with approximately 22788 (SF), was
currently vacant and used for storage.
Procedures
The planning, architecture, and operational
assessment team combined semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observation assessment
methods to understand needs, goals, and environmental challenges across diverse departments.
The CAH’s Ethics Committee reviewed and
approved the study protocol. For this article, we
will primarily focus on the survey responses. We
collected data during November and October
2021 over 4 weeks. Initially, the survey was
printed in paper format and distributed by the
CAH coordinator. Later, the CAH used departmental email distribution lists to distribute the
online survey link created in Google Forms. It
was noted in the email and surveyed introductory
paragraph that participation is voluntary. The
study avoided coercion to participate by not offering payment incentives and no threat of harm if
they declined participation. We collected no identifying information from participants.
Instrument
An expert panel of planners, architects, and
researchers collaborated to create a short survey
to understand staff’s satisfaction with 13 items,
including overall physical environment, space
allocation, team communication, patient flow,
medication flow, privacy, provider flow, family–visitor flow, or departmental adjacency. We
could not perform a reliability test due to limited
access to participants. Respondents were asked to
rate the various items based on their perceived

satisfaction level using a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 ¼ extremely dissatisfied to
5 ¼ extremely satisfied. Demographic questions
included department type and role. The openended question asked to the participants is:
“What is working well in your current department? What would you change to make your
department work better?”
In addition to the surveys, 21 staff participated in 10 focus group sessions. The hospital
coordinator recruited staff through emails,
encompassing nurses, physicians, administrative, and leadership roles. The team explored
clinical and administrative staff experiences
regarding physical environment needs impacting processes and performances. Questions
focused on department goals, challenges, and
success factors. Similar to the open-ended questions in the survey, we also asked the staff about
the physical environment changes needed to
improve their care delivery. Handwritten notes
were taken during the focus group interviews,
capturing essential insights. This article focuses
primarily on reporting the responses relevant to
the physical environment concerns.
Participants
The CAH site was undergoing a 3-year master
facility planning; thus, the study was based on a
convenience sample. The entire CAH staff was
the population of interest, including managers,
clinicians, and nonclinicians (n ¼ 207). There
were no exclusion or inclusion criteria.
Seventy-four individuals completed the online
or paper survey with an overall 36% response
rate. Tables 2 and 3 display participants’ departments and roles. Due to limited direct access to
participants, we conducted no further analysis to
determine the characteristics of staff who did not
respond.
Data Preparation and Analysis
Qualitative data preparation and analysis of
open-ended responses were performed in MS
Excel. The Google Form and paper-based
responses were organized and merged into an
MS Excel document. Descriptive statistics were
analyzed using the JASP Version 0.16.4.0 software for the Likert-type scale-based questions.
The internal expertise team reviewed all codes

department, medical office buildings, and a vacant nursing center. Source: Image Copyright: Author.

to ensure data validity and interpretation. The
goal was to understand the staff’s level of satisfaction with the overall physical environment,
space allocation, department adjacency, and privacy. The second phase included looking at
departments with lower satisfaction ratings for
these physical environment ratings. Initially, all
transcripts were coded based on their contents
with particular attention to subthemes suggested
by Pati et al. (2016a): (a) any direct reference to
the facility needs or physical environment qualities of the CAH, including the buildings,
departments, and workspaces, and (b) any outcomes associated with the physical design such
as staff or patient experiences, care quality,
operations, or safety. Next, we clustered the
subthemes into key themes aligning with the
content analysis performed by Cai et al.
(2019) and Pati et al. (2016a).
Results
Satisfaction Ratings
Table 3 displays the descriptive statistics for the
overall CAH and staff’s average satisfaction per
department (Table 4). The findings suggest low
satisfaction levels for ED, lab, surgery, and
wound-care space allocations. Wound-care staff
was also comparatively dissatisfied with department adjacency and the overall environment
compared to other departments. The surgical staff
was the least satisfied with the privacy attributes
of their department. Due to low participation

qualitative and not generalizable.
Open-Ended Findings
Two clusters emerged from the content analysis,
representing facility needs (rightly sized spaces,
functional needs, COVID-19 needs, and
improved access) and physical environment conditions (clutter, visibility, flooring quality, noise,
privacy, cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and temperature; Table 5 and 6). Safety and quality were
the two emerging outcomes of the physical environment’s shortcomings: safety concerns to infection control compliance and patient, equipment,
and staff safety; quality pertained to patient flow,
staff flow, staff performance, patient–visitor

Facility needs. Facility needs were the most mentioned themes in the open-ended responses.
Emerging subthemes included the need for adequately sized spaces, functional needs, COVID19 needs, and access improvements that will be
reviewed in the subsequent paragraphs.
Rightly sized spaces. The first subtheme focuses
on the inadequate space sizes in outdated buildings. These included desiring larger departments,
workstations, exam rooms, bathrooms, offices,
meeting spaces, waiting rooms, equipment
rooms, break rooms, or training rooms. Administrative staff reflected the need for larger meeting
spaces for staff, office spaces, and rounding
rooms. Lab department staff requested more
extensive patient waiting, storage, drawing area,
testing space, equipment room, or intravenous
(IV) rooms to improve patient experience and
flow. The ED staff mentioned needing larger
patient rooms to accommodate computers, equipment rooms, storage space, and adequately sized
nurse stations to improve patient flow. Universal
and flexible rooms that were identical to monitoring capabilities were desired. The surgical team
perceived the space needed to be more responsive
to departmental growth. They emphasized the
need for larger storage spaces, nurse stations,
ORs, patient bays, and central sterile spaces corresponding to the patient volume. The insufficient
equipment storage space affected equipment
safety outcomes, as one of the staff explained:
Table 7. Example of Quotes Relevant to Safety and Quality Outcomes.
Themes Subthemes Example of Quote
Safety Infection control New flooring that is waterproof and does not have gaps for blood and
tissue to be trapped-Infection control (Woundcare Center)
Patient safety There is room for improvement to increase emergency response efficiency
and employee or patient safety with changes to the exterior public and
private entrances, an exterior reconfiguration of the ED Ambulance
Entrance, or even a total relocation of the ED (emergency
department [ED])
Equipment safety The facility invests in state-of-the-art equipment, and there is nowhere to
put it and care for it. It gets moved around and bumped (Surgery)
Staff safety I liked the wall in registration terms of safety, but now it is open. If you put
glass instead of a wall, that would be great (Registration).
Quality Patient flow We’ve outgrown the space here in peri-operative. As it stands now, it
would be difficult to hold more than one total joint patient until they are
ready and cleared for discharge (Surgery)
Staff flow and performance Our bays are extremely small. It makes it difficult to accommodate visitors,
perform nerve blocks, or attend to a patient if an additional provider is
also in the bay. The bays are very close, with only a curtain between
them. There is no privacy whatsoever (Surgery)
Patient–visitor experience

We have limited staff education space and meeting spaces (Admin)
Comfort The rounding room is too small, and the upstairs conference room is too
crowded, with many different items and folks competing for space
(Admin)
Reduced cost We have outgrown the operating room (OR) and need more storage.
Some of our equipment is stored in the old nursing center, and if it is
needed during surgery, we have to wait for someone to get the
equipment and wait for them to return. This is costing time and money
due to no storage (Surgery)
Zamani et al. 313
We are outgrowing our space in the OR. We need
more room to store our equipment. The facility
invests in state-of-the-art equipment, and there is
nowhere to put it and care for it. It gets moved
around and bumped.
The small patient bays affected staff performance, visitor experience, and communication
outcomes. One staff member commented on
how the small bays affect their operations:
“Our bays are tiny. It makes it difficult to
accommodate visitors, perform nerve blocks,
or attend to a patient if there is an additional
provider in the bay.”
Staff emphasized the need for a more extensive Sterile Processing Department (SPD) to
accommodate more washers, storage, and desk
space to support the number of sterilized trays
and OR procedures. The inadequate space
resulted in stacking trays on each other, which
resulted in the risk of case delays, contamination,
and subsequent patient infection. Further, the
poorly stacked trays created safety concerns for
staff as they needed to bed down to pick heavy
trays from shelves (Figure 3).
Functional needs. Functional needs were captured by mentioning additional spaces or
revised adjacencies varying by the department.
Administrative staff reflected the need for
more meeting or conference spaces, additional
classrooms, workspace, or rounding rooms with
integrated technology for virtual meetings.
Another administrative staff mentioned the
need for private office rooms to “be more
cohesive to accomplish more work.”
The clinical staff communicated the concern
about the lack of storage in the ED, resulting in
cluttered hallways and a “jammed” nurse station
that imposed a safety hazard. ED staff requested
additional bathrooms, equipment rooms, safe
rooms, and exterior decontamination storage.
One of the ED staff elaborated on the possible
reuse of the nursing home currently used as storage for the ED spatial needs (Figure 4). One of the
staff elaborated:
[the closed nursing home facility] area would give
the Emergency Room (ER) the Space it needs, storage, extra bathrooms, and privacy adjacent to our
helicopter flight area. Saving the patient at least 10
minutes of critical time.
The clinical staff communicated the
concern about the lack of storage in the
ED, resulting in cluttered hallways and a
“jammed” nurse station that imposed a
safety hazard.
Staff from the imaging department thought the
adjacency to ED was optimal. They reflected the
need for an additional shower and changing
rooms for the entire facility. Laboratory staff
reflected the need for staff break rooms and lockers, American Disability Act (ADA)–compliant
toilets, and storage. One staff noted that departmental adjacencies were substantial for efficient
flow, cost, and patient satisfaction: “We need
more space. And not chopped-up space; you must
walk across the hall to use additional space. We
need space that is all together.”
“We need more space. And not choppedup space; you must walk across the hall to
use additional space. We need space that

The pharmacy department requested additional patient toilet rooms and a satellite pharmacy. Outpatient clinic staff thought the
separate clinic buildings with three to four exams
per building were not optimal, as one described:

requirements. With this inefficient adjacency,
there was a need for reserved parking and a risk
of patient falls. This situation also impacted
patient safety and satisfaction outcomes as
patients needed to gown and drive to the chamber.
Surgical staff explained the need for additional
equipment storage, workspaces, bathrooms, and
walled patient bays. An inadequate number of
post anesthesia care unit (PACU) bays resulted
in an urge to discharge patients to maintain flow
from the OR to patient bays, which affected the
patient experience of feeling “rushed to be discharged.” Staff perceived the need for bays with
doors to protect patient privacy and satisfy storage needs in bays. Surgical staff described that
inappropriately located equipment storage affects
efficiency and cost outcomes.

COVID-19 needs. Smaller departments, such as
lab, cardiac rehab, or ED, were more concerned
about spatial limitations that restricted the
COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. The ED
registration staff complained about the waiting
area congestion and its impact on visibility and
safety during the pandemic. The staff noted that
moving sick patients to another section with
removable dividable walls during the pandemic
was safer. However, these walls impeded visibility for the ER registration staff. Therefore, the
ED registration staff recommended including
glass walls to support visibility and patient
separation (Figure 5). With the ease of pandemic
limitations, the CAH removed the walls with only
one glass wall remaining, resulting in the current
open waiting room that decreased the perception
of safety for staff.
The pandemic highlighted the need for revisiting the ambulance entrance to the ED as it presented spatial challenges to accommodate
officials for mass casualty and contaminated
patient incidents. Further, staff elaborated on the
need for climate-controlled storage for decontamination equipment adjacent to the ED. Decontamination equipment stored in a distant location
from the ED entrance and exterior space could
have been more efficient spatial adjacency.
Most outpatient clinic patients had complex
chronic conditions; some traveled up to 20 miles
to access primary care services. Clinicians recommended expanding telehealth services for wellness visits due to Medicare reimbursement. The
current use of telehealth for provider visits was
10%. In the current state, preregistration occurs
through text messages, patients wait in the car and

guidelines for infectious patient divisions. Other wall divisions that impeded visibility had been removed. Source:

alert their arrivals, and nurses screen patients in
the cars and direct them from back doors if
suspected to be infectious by COVID-19. However, older patients struggled with telehealth
and preferred meeting the provider in person
or over the phone.

access, staff recommend extending the operating hours for some departments, including physical therapy. Staff also mentioned necessary
exterior upgrades to improve patient accessibility, especially for older patients: “For patients
with walkers, walking across sand or accessibility with a ramp is difficult; we need to improve
the patient experience.”
Smaller scale clinics were a positive attribute
for patient experience outcomes as they reduced
walking distances for older patients. Adjacency
and access to or within departments were also
crucial for staff. For example, lab staff explained
the need for a more cohesive department to
reduce walking distances and improve staff performance. Adding automatic doors for ED was
also a recommendation to improve visitor access
and staff efficiency to eliminate the need for
staff to open doors.
Physical environment attributes and ambient
condition. Staff elaborated on improving physical
environment attributes and ambient conditions by
reducing clutter, improving visibility, flooring
material quality, cleanliness, aesthetic condition,
temperature comfort, and privacy attributes discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.
Reduce clutter. Restricted space in specific
departments such as ED or surgery resulted in
a need for more storage spaces for equipment,
carts, or beds cluttered ambiance (Figure 6).
Staff believed that reducing the clutter improves
efficiency, safety, and costs. Staff commented on
the need for additional equipment storage to
improve flow and reduce hallway clutter for
operational efficiency outcomes. One of the
ED nurses described how the nursing station
gets cluttered with personnel and carts. This
condition reduced the clinician’s satisfaction,
as one described: “We feel like we are sardines
in our nurse’s station.” State-of-the-art equipment stored in the hallways surgical department was bumped and moved around, which
harmed equipment quality. The surgical services staff emphasized the importance of
reducing OR clutter to improve operations and
movements.
Visibility. Visibility was an important attribute,
especially for the ED department. Staff noted that
the nurse station size and form affected visibility
toward psychiatric patients. The registration staff
noted that the wide registration area with inadequate security staff in the evenings is a security
concern. The lab department staff considered the
open workstation design a positive attribute,
improving visibility and communication among
staff and managers.
Flooring quality. The bedded care staff noted the
need to replace the corridor carpet in a few
years, when obsolete, with a hard surface—luxury vinyl tile to improve infection control outcomes (Figure 7). Staff recommended flooring
quality improvements that included removing
stains and cracks, improving exterior flooring
quality, and installing waterproof material without
gaps. Such improvements needed the dismissal of
short-term costs to satisfy infection control guidelines and patient safety.
Improve cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and
temperature. The hospital needed updating,
cleaning, and modernization to improve staff
recruitment, visitor perception, safety, and conformance to the current healthcare architectural
style. Staff found that departments were
“antiquated” and reflected the need to remodel
and replace dark floorings and walls (Figure 8).
For example, a staff described: “the hospital
should not look old. We need to improve the
flooring and waiting rooms and facelift things.
Landscaping needs attention: the parking lot
needs to be kept up, and visual needs to improve.”

One comment on needing a better air conditioning system in the cardiopulmonary department influenced staff comfort levels.
Reduce noise and improve privacy. Smaller
departments and insufficient workspaces resulted
in a perception of a noisy environment impeding
performance, especially for ED and surgical staff.
Privacy concerns for patients and staff were vital
for physician dictation rooms, phone call rooms,
triage rooms, check-in areas, registration, and
patient bays. Several clinicians mentioned adding
doors to the bays or private patient rooms in the
ED to improve patient privacy (Figure 9). The ED
and surgical staff reflected that the curtain
between beds was insufficient for patient privacy.
Patient privacy was also essential for registrationcheck-in staff, as one staff noted: “we need something better for patient privacy instead shouting
information out to everyone.”"

the United States will rise from 46.2 million to 80.8 million by 2040.
Approximately 15% of adults ages 50 and older experience mental health illness (National Institute of Mental Health, 2020). The healthcare industry is
rapidly changing to meet the needs of this growing aging population and
achieve the fundamental patient-centered goals of healthcare. To that point,
there has been growing research focusing on the relationship between the built
environment and staff’s work satisfaction and patients’ wellbeing (Dijkstra
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2019). The human relationship with the built and
natural environment is extensively discussed by architects and designers

These fields offer a unique perspective with an empirical and theoretical
understanding of healthcare settings. However, there remains a significant gap
in knowledge pertaining to the architecture of psychiatric geriatric care (PGC)
centers and its impact on staff and patients. This study evaluates the impact
of the built environment on staff’s work satisfaction and geriatric psychiatric
patients’ health and wellbeing. It also assesses the importance of treating mental and physical illness of older adults in the same clinical setting.
Psychiatric hospitals are being transformed to positively impact patients’
experience, wellbeing, and recovery (Chrysikou, 2019). Older adults with psychiatric problems tend to have more physical health issues than those without
mental health illnesses (Daumit et al., 2002; Prior et al., 1996). The impact of
aging complicates the diagnosis and treatment of mental health, and therefore
increases their time spent in a hospital bed (Harrell, 2002). Thus, there is a
higher risk of morbidity and mortality for psychiatric patients with physical
illness (Sprah et al., 2017). However, transferring patients between psychiatric
care and medical hospital settings can result in challenges when care is not
provided in the same location. Examples of medical challenges that can be
avoided by providing mental and physical care services in the same hospital
include a reduction in: (a) the prevalence of prescribing omissions from 64.7%
to 11.2% and (b) inappropriate prescription of medicines from 77.3% to
18.6% (Lang et al., 2012). The prevalence of chronic health conditions in older
adults with mental illness and the challenges in providing care present an
immediate need for research to guide the design of integrated mental and
physical health care for older adults, to ameliorate the long-lasting impact of
mental and physical illness (Jones et al., 2004).
Until recently, the design of most care environments for older adults has
been based on previous models or information from care staff and architects without input from the older adults themselves (Norouzi et al., 2019;
O’Malley et al., 2017). This article presents findings from a study assessing
the environmental requirements of a PGC unit by analyzing existing geropsychiatric hospitals and directly interviewing staff and older adult patients
about their needs regarding the built environment to ensure their preference will be considered in the future design of these centers. These finding
were then incorporated into creating a hypothetical design model of a PGC
center to be used as an example by other hospital owners and designers.
Materials and methods
Study setting
Three psychiatric hospitals, Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C, with
similar settings and designated geriatric wings, participated in this study.
2 N. NOROUZI
The original design of each hospital campus included multiple wings, one of
which was dedicated to geriatric patients. For the purposes of this study,
geriatric patients are those who are either over 65 years old or younger but
have major neurological impairments, making it difficult for them to care for
themselves (defined by a geriatric psychiatrist interviewed for this study). Site
selection was based on hospital typology, status as a state facility, and
approval from the hospital’s superintendent or institutional review board.
Ethical approval
Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of
the first author’s university. Authorization to conduct the study was obtained
in each PGC center. Each participant signed a written consent form after
being informed of the description and objectives of the study, the voluntary
nature of participation, the ability to withdraw at any time, and the audio
recording of the interviews. Participation in the study was confidential, and
required measures were implemented to ensure data protection.
Data collection
Data were collected through two sources of behavioral observation/mapping
and interviews.
Behavior observation/mapping
Observation is an ideal way to study nonverbal human behavior, expressions, postures, and the physical environment of a space (Lipson-Smith &
McLaughlan, 2022). Behavior observation/mapping is an objective method
of noting actions, attitudes, and social interactions within the built environment. It provides data related to characteristics of the environment, including type, time, place, and the people involved in each activity. The research
team used place-centered mapping to observe and record different activities
and interactions that took place in the “community living room” of each
geriatric unit. Each hospital had just one community living room per unit.
The square footage of the community living rooms for all hospitals was
similar. However, the common space in Hospital C was adjacent to a
secure outdoor balcony.
Observations were recorded by sketching people in each space and marking different activities on the architectural plan of that space (e.g.,
Figure 1). Observation method of different behaviors was based on different type and level of interactions. Each observation session was conducted
by two researchers and lasted for three hours. Table 1 presents definitions
for different behaviors that were observed and recorded.
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 3
Interviews
Interview questions were developed using the research team’s initial analysis of 60 articles related to mental healthcare. The issues that emerged
from the literature analysis led to questions focused on the use of the
building including an onsite medical care unit, the impact of the built
environment on staff’s safety and comfort, and patients’ wellbeing and
recovery. Interview questions were not pilot tested or provided to interviewees prior to the interview. Interviews were semi-structured and
recorded for verbatim transcriptions.
Interviewee recruitment consisted of emailing hospital superintendents
and asking for participation. After the initial agreement, the superintendent
sent a general email to all employees inviting them to participate in the
study. The email body included the first names and affiliations of the
research team members, a female assistant professor as the first author and
a male graduate student, and their objectives for the study. The email also
stated that the interviewees’ responses will be used in presentations and
publications to inform design decisions for future PGC centers. The
research team connected with interviewees and built rapport by spending
time in each hospital, observing, and talking to employees and patients one
day prior to starting the interview process. Employees who were interested
in participating in the study expressed their willingness by responding to
the email. Staff interviews lasted between 45 and 60 min. Patient interviewees were recruited through the director of patients’ rights within each hospital. The only patients who participated were the ones who were able to
provide consent and comprehend the interview process and questions. All
patient interviews were conducted in the presence of a staff member familiar with that patient to ensure the safety and comfort of both the patient

and the interviewer. Each interview lasted between 15 and 20 min. All
patients interviewed for this study were aged 65 or older and none of the
participants dropped out.
Although difficult to determine a specific number for sample size in
grounded theory studies, 10–60 is a typical number of participants reported
(Starks & Trinidad, 2007). The research team of this study continued interviewing participants until they agreed on both code and meaning saturation
(Aldiabat & Le Navenec, 2018). The interviewers discussed the responses
after every 10 interviews were conducted. These discussions were brief and
mostly focused on whether the team was collecting and learning new information. Though some information were repetitive among patient responses,
there was enough differences to convince the interviewers to continue until
they “heard it all” and fully understood all the issues raised by the interviewees (Hennink et al., 2017). The interviewees included 15 patients and
29 doctors, nurses, and therapists. Additional participants, unique to each
hospital, included peer support personnel (2), patients’ rights staff (2),
environmental services staff (1), dietitians (2), geriatric mental health service providers (3), activity coordinator (1), and administrators (4). The
research team was not informed of anyone refusing to participate in the
study and none dropped out after the initial agreement.
Data analysis
This research uses a constructivist grounded theory methodology.
Constructivist grounded theory responds to questions of how, when, and to
what extent the study is involved with other positions, networks, and situations (Charmaz, 2008), as well as how, when, and to what extent the study,
both data collection and analysis, is influenced by the relationships and
experiences of participants and the point of views, perspectives, positions,
and interactions of the researcher (Charmaz, 2014). In this study, some of
the participants from Hospital A and C had spent time in other psychiatric
hospitals, which led to a specific perception and position on how the built
environment could be designed to enhance the quality of life for older
adults. An example of these environmental features was an onsite medical
unit. Constructivist grounded theory is used in this study to develop an
explanatory theory of the influence of the built environment on staff and
patients as well as the necessity of an onsite medical unit within a PGC.
Although constructivist grounded theory is not traditionally used for creating design models, it is useful in architectural research as it generates a
new substantive concept (Lianto, 2019) and has been used to propose
architectural design process (Norouzi et al., 2019).
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 5
Behavior observation/mapping analysis
Through side-by-side comparison and assessment of the detailed sketches
of patients’ daily activities with the notes taken of the same event, the
research team coded the placement of architectural features, layout of furniture, location of patients in relation to one another, types of activities
taking place, and length of time for each activity.
Interview analysis
Members of the research team individually read, re-read, and conducted
line-by-line and focused coding of the transcriptions while examining the
data for ideas, thoughts, feelings, issues, and challenges mentioned by the
interviewees (Charmaz, 2008). For example, one of the patients said, “It
doesn’t matter if I have my own bedroom, but I want my own locked
drawer and a TV.” One member of the research team coded this line as
ownership and another coded it as patient preference. During the focused
coding this was discussed and agreed to be coded as patient needs and then
categorized under autonomy. These preliminary codes were analyzed and
grouped based on meaning similarities. For example, access to family visitation rooms, multi-religion/spiritual place, and shared dining room were
coded as connection and single patient bedrooms and bathrooms were
coded as privacy. The identified subcategories of connection and privacy
were then placed under autonomy as a major category.
Categories and subcategories were organized to reflect the users’ perception of how the design of the hospital influenced their daily activities
(Tolley et al., 2016). This process verified some of the categories found in
the literature but also permitted the emergence of new categories. All categories were then juxtaposed with the notes and sketches from behavior
observation/mapping and reanalyzed through triangulation of various data
sources, multiple discussion, and integration of memos (Glaser, 1978) to
develop theoretical coding. For example, the behavior mapping illustrated
that many patients were watching television while a doctor was having a
private conversation with a patient in the same space. While patient interviewees did not mind conversing with doctors in public spaces, the staff
requested multiple therapy spaces of different sizes. The juxtaposition of
these findings resulted in the recommendation of adding smaller common
spaces and multiple therapy rooms for each unit. Another example that
emerged from literature analysis, patients’ descriptions of other hospitals,
and eager response of interviewees was the need for an onsite medical unit
that serves patients’ physical needs. Although, the research team did not
have any behavior/observation mapping data on this topic, the number of
interviewees requests and inquires for an onsite medical unit was precise
and clearly justified by both patients and staff. Example of these responses
6 N. NOROUZI
include “psychiatric hospitals vary widely in their ability to take care of
patients’ medical needs and it is difficult to decide where to admit a patient
with both medical and psychiatric illnesses, so many of these patients usually take longer to heal [ … ] This is even worse for older adults because
they are probably more fragile” said a psychologist from Hospital A, and
“we need to make sure the older patients are physically healthy and able to
participate in therapeutic interventions for their mental health, so we examine them often. But if they get sick, we send them to a different hospital to
be treated. This means either their mental or physical health needs to be
on hold at any given time” said a nurse from Hospital C. The research
team triangulated interviewees’ responses with the literature analysis findings and created the subcategory of medical care unit under the category of
safety. During this stage, the research team compared notes and sketches
from behavioral mapping with interviewees’ description of a space or
expectation of a place to acquire a comprehensive understanding of user’s
needs that led to the development of theoretical coding. The research team
discussed all the final codes, categories, and subcategories to reach 100%
agreement that led to theoretical coding.
Results and discussion
Theoretical coding
The results of this study reveal a relationship between the architectural
design of a PGC center and the wellbeing of geropsychiatric patients and
the safety of staff as well as the need for a medical care unit at a PGC center. The assessment of the behavior observation/mapping notes and
sketches resulted in specific spatial qualities that could positively contribute
to or hinder staff and patients’ behavior, especially when juxtaposing with
the results of staff and patient interviews. Below is the discussion of how
the findings of this study contributed to the theoretical code and incorporated in the architectural design model. Table 2 presents an example of the
existing architectural qualities of common spaces in each hospital and how
these features affected different types of interactions.
The behavior observation/mapping of the common space in Hospital A
reveals activity limitations for patients and an unsafe and uncomfortable
setting for staff. The architectural qualities of this space, presented in
Table 2, prevent any interactive peer interactions and present the need for
private nooks within the public spaces, similar to what Wang and
Brockmole titled “nested environments” (2003). The results of the patients’
interviews confirm their need for privacy both within the framework of
their private rooms and in the common spaces.
JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 7
The common space of Hospital B is near the open nurse station, which is a
prime location for patient interaction with staff and other patients (Jovanovic
et al., 2019). Although patients preferred the common space near the nurse station, their interview responses emphasize their desire for control and privacy.
Examples of these statements are: “I like being around other people but not
always with them” and “I like to make friends and do different things, […]
because everyone is different and sometimes we like to be alone in our room,
sometimes with a lot of people.” This verified the need for private spaces within
each public space.
The common space of Hospital C is adjacent to an outdoor balcony and
offers a great combination of an indoor-outdoor connection that could
potentially provide opportunities for different types of interaction.
However, this space was too small for any type of gathering and the behaviors observed by the research team were only solitary, wandering, or parallel peer where patients were walking around aimlessly or sitting close to
one another but not interacting with each-other. This led to the decision of
creating large common spaces that are modifiable and allow for change in
the use of space when needed.
The result of the staff interviews presented the immediate need for physical and psychological safety of the staff, and their comfort. Interviewees’
requests included centrally located nursing stations, multiple entry therapy
rooms, and private spaces to work, exercise, and rest. Table 3 presents the
properties and subcategories of the categories identified by the staff.
Table 2. Examples of behaviors in common spaces of different hospitals.
Hospital Behavior Space Qualities of space
A S, PP, IS, W Common space Lobby area surrounded by main building entrance on
the south, offices on north and west and the unit’s
enclosed nurse station on the north—in addition
to being used as a corridor, the space is used as a
TV room by patients. It is too small for the
number of patients, especially if they are
interested in different types of activities during
their free time, with minimum natural light and
almost no view of the outside.
B IP, IS, W, S, PP Common Space Living room placed in the center of the four patients
wings and next to an open nurse station, including
small sitting areas but no large tables—this
allowed patients to stand around the nurse’s desk,
interact with staff and their peers.
C S, W, PP Common Space with
Outdoor Balcony
A well-lit space with multiple seating arrangements
for two or three people to sit at each setting. This
space was adjacent to a kitchenette that led to a
fenced outdoor balcony—these three spaces gave
patients choices but not enough options for
interaction and, as a result, most patients were
wandering or seating individually.

Centrally located nursing stations can serve as a landmark in geriatric
patients’ wayfinding (O’Malley et al., 2022), and open nursing stations connect patients and staff and provide a sense of freedom (Southard et al.,
2012). The nurses interviewed for this study expressed mixed feelings about
open nursing stations, as these limit confidentiality and concentrated workspace. The chief nurse at Hospital A said, “You can never get everyone to
agree but the bottom line is that staff need to feel safe and have space to
do their job without compromising patient information.” Multiple staff
members emphasized the fact that some patients stay in the hospital for
longer periods of time, and it is therefore important to offer them a
“home-like” environment. A registered Nurse from Hospital B said “We
call the open space adjacent to the nurse station the living room, so it
needs to feel like a home with family members who trust each-other. If we
sit behind a glass wall and close ourselves to patients, we are telling them
that they are not trustworthy.” The interviewees acknowledged that open
nurse stations offer opportunities for more positive socializing and
exchange as well as direct verbal communication between staff and patients.
This leads to a decrease in aggression toward staff (Southard et al., 2012)
and significantly reduces the patients’ number of seclusion episodes
(Oostermeijer et al., 2021).
Therapy rooms with multiple entrances offer the staff opportunities of
escape when needed. In describing how a staff member might get stuck

with an agitated patient, a psychologist interviewed for this study said,
“Patients go into a therapy room, and for the staff to get in there they
must leave the hallway and then kind of go at an angle, away from everyone else. If the patient decides to block the door and harm the staff, there
is no place for them to go. The staff is trapped back there. If the room has
two doors, the staff can use the second door to leave. Others could also
enter to help.” A music therapist described the benefit of multiple entrances for patients and said, “Some patients wander and with double doors,
they can go in one door and out the other. I see this happen often during
group therapy sessions. The patient wants to stay in the session but doesn’t
have the patience.”
Private spaces were recognized by the staff as areas separated from
patients. One of the nurses said, “It is hard to complete charts and focus
on patient’s recovery plan in an office that patients can access. Even with
the door closed, someone will bang on the door; we need a private workroom.” A performance program supervisor talked about the importance of
staff safety and rejuvenation and said that “it is critical to have a comfort
room for staff.” One of the nurses who worked as a Personal Need
Allowance (PNA) said, “It will be great to have a space for staff that experience trauma or a stressful situation so they can go there and breathe, meditate, and relax before getting back to work.” Staff interviewees also talked
about the benefit of a having a gym on campus. A director of environmental services at Hospital C talked about the outdoor walking trails for
patients and added, “But staff can’t really walk there without being
approached by patients. It will be nice to have a place with equipment for
exercise and showers.”
Staff interviewees often talked about patients’ physical and psychological
needs. A psychologist said, “We have four patients in each room but even
though the rooms are spacious, there is absolutely not enough space for
four people who might be mad at each-other. The best-case scenario is to
have at least 50% of the bedrooms be private and the others be double for
patients who prefer to have a roommate.”
Patients interviewed for this study talked about their urgent need for
spaces that offer privacy while providing opportunities to connect, places to
rest and heal, and areas of exploration and discovery, such as sensory
rooms. One of the patients said, “I was in a different hospital before and
we had a gym, a print shop there. I was the supervisor and helped other
patients print shirts for their family. It was nice to have something to do.”
Another patient talked about the difficulty of meeting her family on campus due to the shortage of private visiting rooms. Table 4 presents the
properties and subcategories of the four categories that emerged from
patients’ data.

Medical unit in PGC center
The hospitals included in this study did not have a medical care unit.
However, the results of the literature analysis and the data collected from
the interviews conducted for this study presented an imperative need for a
medical care unit connected to the PGC center. Some patient interviewees
talked about their physical health needs and the inconvenience of having to
travel to a medical care facility outside of the hospital to receive care. Staff
members described the challenges in responding to patients’ medical needs
and enthusiastically requested an onsite medical care unit. The geriatric
psychologist said, “The geriatric unit is generally slower and calmer. But
one main issue is the patients’ medical needs. So, we really need to have a
space with hospital beds and equipment to take care of those patients without sending them outside of the state hospital and delaying the mental

be cared for, [ … ] I understand the ligature [attachment points for ties that
could cause bodily harm] risk, but the geriatric patients need medical care,
and we need to find a way to do it here.” One patient expressed discomfort
about having to leave the hospital once a month to get checked for an
existing medical condition and another patient said, “It’s hard for me to
sleep so I take medicine and try to adjust my bed to help me. I need to
have my oxygen level adjusted but for that I have to go to another hospital
and that’s really hard.” The superintendent talked about the difficulty of
communication and information transfer between medical and psychiatric
hospitals when patients must leave and return. Multiple therapists disclosed
their concern about the gap in patients’ psychiatric treatments while they
are in the medical hospital.
Design model for PGC center
The findings of this study resulted in creating a replicable design model
and architectural base for future PGC centers. The essential discoveries that
informed this model include providing visibility, accessibility, and rejuvenation for staff while respecting patients’ autonomy, atmosphere, boundary,
and safety.
This model was developed in three phases. The first version was created
by two architecture students under the supervision of the principal investigator. This version of the model included a central public space that connected two psychiatric wings and nursing stations. This model was
presented to a team of experts including architects, nurses, doctors, and
patients’ caregivers. The main concern voiced about this version of the
model was the lack of funding for two nurse stations. The design team
then revised the model and presented a second version with one central
nurse station connecting two psychiatric wings to the team of experts. The
second presentation and multiple discussions between the author and the
expert team led to the latest version of this model (Figure 2) illustrated
below. This version was developed by the author and approved by the
expert team.
The design model incorporates the theoretical code developed in this
study and includes a central nurse station that offers staff maximum visibility and unobtrusive surveil of entire unit while providing a safe space to
plan activities and coordinate with other staff. Accessibility is safely provided through (a) multiple entrances and exits in each therapy room so
that staff can keep the patients in the room if necessary, while also offering
them the opportunity to leave and return (Simonsen & Duff, 2020), b)
12 N. NOROUZI
adequate lighting in all areas, (c) central spaces for staff to meet with
patients and receive quick help if necessary, and (d) use of anti-ligature
material and furniture. This model responds to the staff’s need for rejuvenation by dedicating a section of the building to staff members. This section
includes private offices, indoor/outdoor breakrooms, multiple restrooms, a
workout area, a medication room, and an open nurse station with a clear
line of sight to all wings. The offices are in the back and away from
patients so the staff can work privately.
This model respects patients’ autonomy by offering a sense of privacy
and dignity through single bedrooms with private bathrooms (Ulrich et al.,
2018), access to semi-private outdoor courtyards, and semi-private seating
areas within indoor common spaces, private visitation rooms for patients
and their families (Jovanovic et al., 2019), multiple private meeting rooms
for private conversations between doctors and patients and their families
(Jenkins et al., 2015), and a series of waist-high walls throughout the unit
to promote mini conversations and to construct nested environments
where a patient can be alone in public (Christenfeld et al., 1989).
This model provides smaller public spaces for each wing while maintaining
the large central public space as a community living room. The small public
spaces with abundant natural light also offer patients opportunities for positive social engagement (Ulrich et al., 2008) or to quickly separate themselves
from problematic situations that might be happening in a hallway (Espinosa
et al., 2015). These additional choices of different places to be and activities
to engage in can help prevent boredom, increases meaningful communication
with peers and staff, and reduces social isolation, all of which are common
challenges for geropsychiatric hospitals (Jovanovic et al., 2019).
This model also offers a medical care unit connected to one of the geropsychiatric wings. This wing is divided into two sections via double doors;
the first section closest to the nurse station includes eight private patient
rooms for geropsychiatric care and the second section includes six private
rooms with hospital beds and the equipment needed to take care of
patients’ medical needs. This section can be closed off and separated in
case of an infectious disease outbreak and the need for quarantining several patients"

Background: Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are among the young population with the highest percentage of mental illness. However, there are limited number of intentionally designed psychiatric hospitals for adolescents. Staff who work in adolescent psychiatric hospitals may face workplace violence. Studies on environmental impacts suggest that the built environment affects patients’ well-being and safety as well as staff’s satisfaction, working condition, safety, and health. However, there are very few studies that focus on adolescent psychiatric hospitals and the impact of the built environment on both staff and patients. Methods: Data were collected through literature analysis and semi-structured interviews with staff of three psychiatric state hospitals with adolescent patient units. The triangulation of multiple data sources informed a set of environmental design conditions that captures the complexity and connectedness of architectural design and the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Results: The results present architectural composition, atmosphere, lighting, natural environment, safety, and security as indispensable design conditions to create an enclosed and city-like campus that provides a serene, secure, and structured environment that benefit staff and adolescent patients. Conclusion: The specific design strategies that need to be incorporated in the architectural design of a safe and secure adolescent psychiatric hospital include an open floor plan that respects patients’ autonomy and offers privacy while always providing staff with full visibility of patients. © The Author(s) 2023.","Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are

(Jones, 2019). One of the main challenges contributing to the limited services is the inadequate
design of adolescent psychiatric hospitals
(McGorry et al., 2013). The impact of the built
environment on patients’ mental health was first
studied in the 1950s (Evans, 2003). Today, after
almost a century, there is still limited information
focused on the cultural and developmental needs
of adolescent psychiatric patients from the built
environment (McGorry et al., 2013). This study
focuses on improving adolescent psychiatric hospital design in a way that directly responds to
their needs.
There are major differences between the needs
of adolescent and children or adults in a psychiatric hospital. Although individuals under the age
of 18 are considered children and may all share
the need of parental support, adolescents require
more control and peer socialization (Borg-Laufs,
2013). While previous studies have proven the
impact of the built environment of a psychiatric
hospital on patients’ positive interactions and
feeling of control and safety, there is a lack of
focus on designing adolescent-specific psychiatric hospitals. This has led to many adolescents
getting admitted to adult or children’s units
(Blumberg & Devlin, 2006; Hutton, 2005).
In a psychiatric hospital, adolescents spend
most of their time in a patient unit under strict
supervision by staff (Chun et al., 2016).
Although this strict supervision is necessary for
patients’ safety, it often leads to aggression and
severely disruptive behavior (Hallman et al.,
2014) toward the staff member working at the
hospital. Staff who work in adolescent psychiatric hospitals may face multiple forms of hostility, aggression, and assault, collectively
referred to as workplace violence that is often
triggered by patients (Hallman et al., 2014;
Ulrich et al., 2018). Studies on environmental
impacts suggest that the built environment
affects patients’ well-being and safety as well
as staff’s satisfaction, working condition, safety,
and health (Sheehan et al., 2013; Trzpuc et al.,
2016). However, most previously published articles are either focused only on adolescent psychiatric hospitals (Hutton, 2005; Gubbels et al.,
2016) or staff members working in these hospitals (Duque et al., 2020; Hallman et al., 2014).
To our knowledge, there are no articles focused
on the impact of the built environment on both
staff and patients. To bridge this gap, the authors
of this study analyzed existing scholarly articles
and conducted interviews at three different state
hospitals with adolescent patient units. Participants’ responses to interviewer prompts highlighted specific architectural categories that
can be applied to designing adolescent psychiatric hospitals.
Method
This study investigates the influence of the built
environment on the health and well-being of adolescent patients and staff of adolescent psychiatric hospitals. The first author responded to a
request for proposal from one of the hospitals for
which she received funding. All procedures were
approved by an institutional review board (IRB).
The site selection began by a web search to identify state psychiatric hospitals that have an adolescent program. The first author then emailed an
invitation to the superintendent of eight hospitals
and asked for their participation. Five hospitals
responded, three of which got approval from their
review boards to participate in the study. These
hospitals (Hospitals A, B, and C) are in urban
setting of different states.
Data Collection
The data collection for this article was conducted
through two phases of (1) literature analyzing and
(2) interviews. The research team searched for
articles published between 2000 and 2020 in the
databases of PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect,
Wiley Online Library, and Cambridge Core. The
key words included architecture of psychiatric
hospitals, adolescent psychiatric hospitals, the
built environment, architecture, interior design,
environmental design, and hospital design. The
article elimination process was first through the
title, followed by the relevancy of the abstract,
and finalized by the review of the full manuscript.
The result was 62 articles of which 22 were analyzed in-depth. Studies were included if they
were (1) peer-reviewed and published in English,
(2) reported design aspects of the hospital
104 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
environment, and (3) explored the impact of the
built environment on patients or staff. After
potential studies were selected, the authors read
and analyzed the articles individually to create a
list of identified design qualities.
Interviews included questions about the participants’ use of the built environment; their
needs from different sections of the hospital;
and the impact of the environment on wellbeing, safety, and productivity of patients and
staff. After the site selection and IRB approval
from the hospital, the first author emailed each
hospital’s superintendent and used snowballing
techniques to identify and contact other participants. This technique is commonly used in qualitative research and requires a key participant
to identify and contact other participants (Daly,
2007). The interviewees of this study include
administrators, adolescent psychologist and
psychiatrist, nurses, therapists, and peer support personnel. Sixty-nine individuals were
interviewed as part of the larger study. For this
analysis, only individuals who had daily interaction with adolescent patients were included in
analysis (n ¼ 30). Each interview lasted
between 30 and 45 min. Adolescent patients
were not interviewed for this study. The interviews collected qualitative data focused on attitudes toward the existing environment,
perception of safety and support, patient interaction and recovery plans, and staff’s need for
rejuvenation and recovery.
Data Analysis
To establish and ensure the validity of study
findings, the authors triangulated multiple data
sources of literature and interviews that led to
the development of a comprehensive understanding of the findings. The analysis of the literature was based on the narrative synthesis
method (Popay et al., 2006) with a preliminary
synthesis done individually by each author to
identify and create a list of design qualities. The
results were then combined, checked, modified,
and verified to achieve 100% agreement by all
authors. Decisions of which themes should be
included were based on this study’s research
question.
Qualitative interviews were recorded using
an iPad and transcribed verbatim by the authors
into a word document. After the first author read
and de-identified the transcriptions, each author
analyzed the transcriptions using a grounded
theory approach that included line-by-line coding, axial coding, and comparative theoretical
coding (Glaser, 1992). The authors first assigned
a code to each relevant line of the transcriptions
to identify ideas, thoughts, feelings, and issues
mentioned by respondents (Charmaz, 2008). The
codes were then sorted and compared across the
responses to draw connections between created
codes. This axial coding formulated categories
of the codes that are most responsive to this
study’s research question and trimmed away
excess codes. The next phase was comparative
theoretical coding (Halberg, 2006) among the
sets of data collected from the three different
hospitals. This process led to systematic connection and contextual arrangement of the categories. The results were initially coded and
categorized by each author and then combined,
checked, modified, and verified to achieve 100%
agreement by all authors.
Results and Discussion
The findings of literature analysis triangulated
and juxtaposed with the results of the interview
analysis informed a set of environmental design
conditions that captures the complexity and connectedness of architectural design and the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric hospital.
Colligating the data revealed a relationship
between the built environment and the success
of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Findings
suggest adolescent psychiatric hospitals must
offer safe and welcoming environments that support patients’ healing and recovery as well as
staff’s satisfaction. In this study, the environmental conditions of the hospital are divided to specific needs of patients and staff. Table 1 presents
all categories that emerged from the data, how
each category is defined in this study for adolescent patients and staff, and several subcategories
that were developed through constant comparative techniques.

The findings of literature analysis
triangulated and juxtaposed with the
results of the interview analysis informed
a set of environmental design conditions
that captures the complexity and
connectedness of architectural design and
the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric
hospital. Colligating the data revealed a
relationship between the built
environment and the success of an
adolescent psychiatric hospital.
Architectural Composition
The architectural composition of an adolescent
psychiatric hospital should respond to adolescents’ psychological needs and healing process
to prepare them for life outside the hospital. It is
important to design the hospital in a way that
patients can freely and safely move between
spaces, participate in different types of therapeutic activities, and interact with each other
and staff (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019; Liddicoat,
2019). One of the participants of this study told
the interviewer that “it is important to offer adolescents control over their environment and
activities [ ... ] to builds up their self-esteem
and help them make friends.” Some of the major
concerns for adolescents with mental illness are
academic difficulties, low educational achievement, low employment, social exclusion, and
possible homelessness (Preyde et al., 2018). The
director of patients’ rights described an ideal
adolescent psychiatric hospital as a small town
where buildings surround a courtyard and there
is a residential unit, a school, and a therapy mall
that includes various therapy rooms, a movie
theater, a pharmacy, a gift store, and a restaurant
to resemble a typical community outside of the
hospital. This enclosed and city-like campus
setting provides a serene, secure, and structured
environment where adolescents can move on the
path of recovery and benefit from the residential
setting, academic programming, and recreational activities. These components contribute
to the “overall success of the patients’ diagnostic process, treatment plan, and the adolescents’
life outside of the hospital,” said one of the psychologists interviewed for this study.
The architectural composition of an
adolescent psychiatric hospital should
respond to adolescents’ psychological
needs and healing process to prepare
them for life outside the hospital.
Accessibility. The interview results presented that
adolescents’ access to different services is one of
the main concerns in state hospitals. These hospitals generally serve both adolescents and
adults on the same campus but are required to
keep the two populations completely separated
for safety and security reasons. Therefore, adolescent units are built in a separate building and
often far away from the adults’ units and the
treatment mall, where the medical and therapeutic services are centralized. Funding limitations
often lead to building one treatment mall to be
shared by both populations but placed closer to
adult units due to the higher number of patients.
A social worker from Hospital A said that “it’s
difficult to bring the children [to the treatment
mall] from all the way on the other end of the
hospital campus,” and the music therapist from
the same hospital suggested that adolescents
“need to have their own therapy spaces, a music
room, art room, physical activities and a gym so
they can stay active.” The adolescent unit at
Hospital B was close to the rest of the campus
and separated only by a courtyard, allowing
patients to share all campus resources by using
them at different times. The director of environmental services from this hospital said, “the kids
have their own playground, but all the sports are
shared and that works when we have enough
staff.” While staffing is a challenge that
designers do not have control over, they can
address campus layout and access to a treatment
mall. One solution is to build a smaller treatment
mall with specific programs only for adolescent
patients, while keeping some of the larger activities such as a basketball court in the main treatment mall for everyone to share.
Norouzi et al. 107
... build a smaller treatment mall with
specific programs only for adolescent
patients, while keeping some of the larger
activities such as a basketball court in the
main treatment mall for everyone to share.
Adjacency. Participants expressed the need for
staff’s visual and audible access to patients from
the nurse station as a necessity of the hospital
design. Adjacency of communal spaces with the
nurse stations offers patients an increased feeling
of freedom and security (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019)
which can help adolescents develop independence, provides a safe space for them to gather
around (Shepley et al., 2016) to increase opportunities for positive interaction, and have a higher
level of connection with staff (Shattell et al.,
2008). This also allows staff to monitor patients
more closely and offer “comfortable seating for
quiet activities near the nurse stations,” said a
nurse at Hospital A. While staff have varying
opinions on open or closed nurse stations,
“patients mostly prefer open without any barrier
such as a plexiglass panel,” said one of the activity nurses at Hospital C. A nurse manager of the
adolescent unit at Hospital B stated “instead of a
glass bubble, we have an open desk in front where
patients gather to talk, read, or work on a puzzle.
The nurses’ offices are in the back of the hub.”
Efficiency. To better serve patients, staff need clear
and quick access to different sections of the adolescent unit as well as different buildings of the
hospital. Circulation and campus planning impact
both functional and psychological aspects of the
workflow by providing fundamental support to
ease the hardship of everyday routines (Jiang, &
Verderber, 2016). It is important to consider the
fastest and safest path for staff to move between
essential locations for patient care and self-care.
Multiple staff members in Hospital A voiced their
concerns about unnecessary distance and wasted
time between the adolescent unit and other units
of the hospital when they need to respond to
emergencies.
Interior layout. It is important to recognize the
appropriate spatial layout and physical spaces of
an adolescent psychiatric hospital in a way that
serves both patients and staff. An open floor plan
is more preferred as it increases face-to-face communication, team interaction, and interdisciplinary collaboration (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019;
Liddicoat, 2019). The nurse manager from Hospital C said, “an open floor plan gives adolescents
the freedom of moving in different spaces while
monitored by staff without being told they can or
cannot go somewhere. It is just easier for everyone.” Adolescents often have difficulties with
interpersonal relationships, social situations,
managing psychiatric symptoms, stigma, and bullying (Preyde et al., 2018). A physician at Hospital A talked about the importance of replicating
family life and social activity in the community to
encourage positive interactions with peers and
improve adolescent patients’ sense of selfworth. An adolescent psychologist from Hospital
C emphasized on the importance of active and
passive behaviors for adolescent patients and said
“there needs to be a place where they can run, be
loud, be teenagers. But they also need a place to
practice being calm.” Examples of interior spaces
that promote active interaction include exercise
and play areas for patients to get engaged in positive movement and exert physical energy
(Trzpuc et al., 2016) and “supervised woodshop
to express creativity with hands-on craft” said the
director of vocational services in Hospital A.
Spaces that inspire passive interactions include
a library, a greenhouse, indoor plants, a spiritual
room (interviewees), quiet rooms, sensory rooms,
dayrooms, and patient rooms with front porches
(Shepley et al., 2016). Offering different types of
spaces provide adolescents a variety of privacy
and opportunities to come together, socialize, and
bond (Hutton, 2005).
Versatility. Versatility is defined as a multipurpose
space that includes built-ins with multiple uses
and can be changed by a single user within minutes (Nanda et al., 2019). Flexible spaces provide
options for spatial configuration and cater to a
wide range of social activities for adolescent
patients. Participants of this study asked for flexible interior spaces that can offer different activities such as “reading, relaxing, playing games,
and watching TV” to help adolescents avoid
108 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
boredom and afford them control over the type of
activity they want to participate in. The Performance Program Supervisor of Hospital B
expressed the need for larger rooms that can be
easily divided and used for different therapy sessions at the same time. The music therapist of
Hospital A said “musical instruments are expensive, and we cannot afford buying multiple of the
same instrument for different units. So, we need a
versatile space that allows the equipment in the
same place to be used at different times.” Therefore, it is important to design versatile spaces with
socio-petal furniture arrangements to promote
positive social interaction, decrease isolation
(Jovanovic´, 2019), facilitate personal space regulation, and provide occupants control of their
environment (Shepley et al., 2016; Ulrich et al.,
2018) in adolescent psychiatric hospitals.
Wayfinding. The ability for adolescent psychiatric
patients to successfully navigate through a care
center is crucial for their daily routine activities.
Wayfinding should be recognized as a high priority when designing psychiatric hospitals as it
can be a challenge in large hospital campuses
with several buildings that lack distinctive
appearance (Devlin, 2014). Inadequate wayfinding and signage can cause aggression or abusive
behavior among patients (Liddicoat, 2019). The
adolescent psychologist from Hospital A emphasized the importance of wayfinding by saying
“these are kids, and they have less patience than
adults [ ... ] they need to go where they want and
get what they want as quickly as possible.” A
wayfinding system needs to be a navigable
and readable environment (Shepley et al., 2017)
and avoid “long corridors, repetitive elements,
and changes of direction within the circulation
system” (Devlin, 2014, pp. 425–426).
Atmosphere
Atmosphere is defined as an emotional reaction to
a specific space and therefore cannot be directly
constructed but emerges from the built environment and its impact on the occupants (Norouzi,
2016). Different architectural characteristics create different atmospheres (Norouzi et al., 2019).
Examples of these characteristics are noise, color,
material, texture, and form that influence spatial
intimacy (Zumthor, 2006), privacy, and autonomy (Norouzi et al., 2019). It is important to
consider the atmosphere of an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it enhances staff and patients’
satisfaction (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019) and wellbeing (Sheehan et al., 2013), increases social
engagement (Trzpuc at al., 2016), and reduces
stress (Ulrich et al., 2018).
Acoustics. Sound and noise can range from stressful to soothing and therapeutic and impact staff,
patients, and visitors of a hospital. An appropriate
acoustic environment benefits staff’s well-being
and patients’ therapy process (Zhou et al., 2020).
However, appropriate acoustic design has not
been a priority in psychiatric hospitals (Shepley
et al., 2017). Unwanted sounds and noise such as
traffic, trains, airports, and community noise
within a hospital unit can hinder staff’s work productivity and communication quality with
patients while causing psychological distress and
helplessness among patients (Shepley et al.,
2017; Ulrich et al., 2018). The director of admissions in Hospital B said, “we need a quiet therapeutic space as staff break room in each unit so
they can relax and unwind but available to
respond to emergencies when needed.” A physical therapist from Hospital C said, “the breeze
through the trees, birds chirping, and sound of
water create a calm environment for patients and
staff. [ ... ], there needs to be a way to have pleasant sound both inside and outside the unit.”
Incorporating acoustic floor and ceiling tiles, wall
panels, movable partition panels, and solid core
doors can mitigate unwanted noise transmissions
(Liddicoat, 2019). Providing single bedrooms in
adolescent psychiatric hospitals enhances privacy
and reduces noise levels from adjacent patient
neighbors (Ulrich et al., 2018). Indoor sensory
rooms can provide opportunities for patients to
listen to music or pleasant nature sounds.
Autonomy. Autonomy, as independence or freedom of choice, is an element often forgotten in
psychiatric hospitals and even more so for adolescents. Respecting patients’ autonomy starts by
providing privacy options. Lack of privacy results
in heightened anxiety levels, stress, and
Norouzi et al. 109
aggression (Liddicoat, 2019). A way to provide
privacy is through offering single bedrooms for
patients. Single bedrooms with private bathrooms
encourage social engagement (Trzpuc et al.,
2016); offers therapeutic security and comfort,
expression of ownership, opportunity to personalize and decorate the space (Shepley et al., 2017),
and freedom to withdraw when feeling unwell
(Jovanovic´ et al., 2019); and improve the dignity
and safety of patients (Sheehan et al., 2013). Private bedrooms can provide a greater “sense of
personal control and security,” said one of the
interviewees. This can be provided by offering
access to technology such as television for entertainment, phone, or computer to stay connected
with family, control over the temperature of their
room for comfort, private lockers to store their
belongings in their bedroom, and most importantly options in the type of activities to be
involved in.
Perception. Offering choices increases an individual’s sense of control and can provide opportunities for patients to modify and personalize their
environment based on personal perceptions (Bergamin et al., 2022; Pasha & Shepley, 2017).
While this is important and possible for personal
spaces, perception is based on interpretation of
experiences (Pasha & Shepley, 2017) and varies
for different people. Therefore, it is difficult to
accommodate in designing public spaces. One of
the most recognized topics in relation to psychiatric hospitals is creating a deinstitutionalized and
homelike environment. Previous studies presented homelike environments can be created
through light and soothing colors, cheerful and
welcoming facade and entrances, use of local
materials and design characteristics (Li, 2018),
clean floors and comfortable furniture (Shepley
et al., 2017), nontextured interior walls (Wang
et al., 2020), view of nature and landscape painting (Evans, 2003), and indoor plants (Duque
et al., 2020) to improve patients and staff’s satisfaction. Although these points are agreed upon in
most research studies, the perception of the space
is influenced by individuals’ associational meaning of the surrounding environment (Wang et al.,
2020) and can be different for many individuals.
Participants described a homelike environment as
a comfortable place with “bright colors, familiar
items from home, a way to listen to music and
podcasts, natural light, comfortable flooring, nice
variety of indoor plants, and outdoor gardens.”
However, the concept of comfort was not defined
by any of the participants.
Another controversial subject related to perception is color. A music therapist interviewed
for this study, said “bright colors could be very
over stimulating because some folks have sensory
deficits.” Yildirim et al. (2011) confirms this by
stating that warm colors provoke active feelings
and, in some cases, increase anxiety. Contrary to
these statements, the chief of psychiatry in Hospital B suggested that “warmer colors are better
than cool blues for the common areas because
they encourage interaction and communication.”
One staff member interviewed for this study said,
“anything but light blues and greens [ ... ] that
feels like an asylum from the old movies; very
institutionalized, not homey at all,” but Yildirim
et al. (2011) suggest that cool colors make the
space feel peaceful, relaxing, and calm.
Respite. In response to a highly stressful work
environment of a psychiatric hospital and to contribute to the staff’s reduction of stress, burnout,
and fatigue, while offering them opportunities to
relax, focus, and concentrate (Nejati et al., 2015),
it is important to create indoor and outdoor
relaxation and rejuvenation areas specific to staff.
Interviewees of this study asked for a balance
between passive and active respite such as a meditation room and a basketball court. Areas of
respite serve as a place to withdraw and seek
refuge from patients and families along with
allowing privacy and socialization with coworkers (Liddicoat, 2019). The staff break area
should include artwork, indoor plants, windows
with outdoor views and access to nature by offering opportunities to walk through gardens,
receive direct sunlight, and listen to the sound
of birds or water (Nejati et al., 2015). Interviewees of this study described the importance of
incorporating access to covered patios, fitness
areas, and outdoor walking trails and asked for
centralized break rooms near work areas, so they
can step away from a hectic work environment,
think and regroup their thoughts.

... it is important to create indoor and
outdoor relaxation and rejuvenation areas
specific to staff.
Lighting
Exposure to light impacts the circadian rhythm
which synchronizes the body’s internal clock and
regulates the sleep cycle (Joseph, 2006). Inadequate exposure to light can lead to reduced cognitive abilities, anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue,
stress, and depression, along with vulnerability
to seasonal affective disorder (Evans, 2003;
White et al., 2013). Therefore, integrating natural
and artificial light in the design of an adolescent
psychiatric hospital is essential for improving
workplace performance for staff and enhancing
patients’ recovery process. It is necessary to
incorporate windows, and skylights allow natural
light into the built environment (Jiang & Verderber, 2016) and select appropriate noninstitutional
lighting fixtures to provide adequate light distribution for day and night usage.
Artificial lighting. Lighting is linked with a sense of
comfort and well-being. Consequently, when
daylight is not sufficient, artificial lighting must
compensate for and provide adequate lighting
that extends the field of view in play areas for
adolescent patients and creates ideal working
conditions for staff. Electric lighting is used to
positively impact mood, circadian rhythm, sleep
cycle, and task performance and decrease depression and length of stay in a hospital (Shepley
et al., 2017). Adequate exposure to artificial light
is essential for night-shift staff in a psychiatric
hospital as it readjusts their circadian rhythm and
helps with irregular sleep–wake schedules that
could lead to health problems (Joseph, 2006).
Artificial lighting design considerations include
glare and shadow-free light distribution, daylight
sensors, dimmers, switch controllers, and high
and uniform luminance.
Natural lighting. Daylight should be prioritized
when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it affects staff and patients’ physical and
psychological health. Inadequate light has a
direct effect on fatigue, insomnia, and other psychiatric diseases (Evans, 2003; Nabil & Mardaljevic, 2006; Shepley et al., 2016). Exposure to
natural lighting can impact staff and patients by
enabling performance of visual tasks (Peek-Asa
et al., 2009), affecting mood and perception (Partonen & Lonnqvist, 2000), controlling the body’s
circadian system and improving sleep cycle
(Boubekri et al., 2014), decreasing aggression
(Ulrich et al., 2014), depression, and anxiety as
well as facilitating wayfinding (Evans, 2003; Liddicoat, 2019; Shepley et al., 2017). The music
therapist in Hospital A mentioned the importance
of integrating natural daylight in adolescent psychiatric hospitals and said, “the kids are generally
happier and more willing to sit through the therapy session in the room with windows and
sunlight.”
Natural Environment
Connection and access to the natural environment
can positively impact physical and mental health
of individuals by improving cognitive abilities,
increasing the sense of belonging and self-worth
(Hammell, 2021), helping patients focus on their
inner healing resources, and offering staff a place
of respite and visitors a relaxed setting to interact
with loved ones (Marcus, 2007). Designing a connection to the natural environment in an adolescent psychiatric hospital can be accomplished
through biophilic design with the goal of providing a healing environment that promotes wellbeing for staff and patients. This could be
achieved by offering direct and indirect connections to natural elements and incorporating
nature-centric spaces with activities ranging from
passive to active (Marcus, 2007). Interviewees
described nature-centric environments as spaces
that include plants, trees, natural materials, artwork, color, water features, and animals. Interviewees also mentioned Zen gardens, planters, green
courtyards, and walking trails as examples of
places that provide opportunities for different levels of activities.
Biophilia. Biophilic design focuses on incorporating nature into the built environment to advance
people’s health, fitness, and well-being.
Norouzi et al. 111
Integrating biophilia in the design of an adolescent psychiatric facility can promote passive and
active interactions. Marcus (2007) lists these
interactions as viewing the garden through a window, sitting outside, dozing/napping/meditating,
gentle rehabilitation exercises, walking to preferred spots, raised bed gardening, and participating in sports. Designing passive connections to
nature can create a temporary escape from an
oppressive atmosphere, offering hope of rapid
recovery, along with experiencing the change in
time, throughout the day and improving the quality of daily routines for staff and patients (Nejati
et al., 2015). An intervention coach from Hospital
C said, “more open spaces with outdoor visibility
and decorative paneling or paintings of nature in
different spaces will help patients feel at peace.”
Nature art presents distinct synergistic benefits
that can impact the psychosocial well-being of
patients by increasing self-esteem and decreasing
social isolation (Thomson et al., 2020). Displaying nature art can reduce patient anxiety and agitation (Shepley et al., 2017) and decrease the use
of anxiety medication (Nanda et al., 2019). The
dentist in Hospital A said, “there’s a mural in our
main walkway that has trees, koala bears, giraffes, and many patients love it” and “it makes
them happy; it makes them think of something
besides their delusions. It’s relaxing.” An adolescent patient who had learned about architects
interviewing members of the hospital wrote a
message and asked a nurse to deliver it to the
research team. The note read,
I like to see artwork that is made by some of us.
There are people here, like this guy in my unit who
draws very nicely. We can have his drawings on the
wall. The big sculptures in the garden are nice too;
specially to look at and relax on a sunny day.
Courtyard. Courtyards, outdoor spaces surrounded
by buildings, can provide opportunities for
recreational activities, play, and gardening. Interviewees of this study requested having multiple
small courtyards accessible to patients for different types of activities. It is important for adolescent patients to have a place to exert their energy
throughout the day (Shepley et al., 2016), and
they are most likely to be physically active in
an outdoor environment that includes greenery
(Gubbels et al., 2016). Patients with the opportunity to walk in a garden, be around diverse plants
and flowers, listen to the sound of water, and
receive direct sunlight are reported to be less
stressed (Nejati et al., 2015). The interviewees
of this study expressed interests for walking trails
that are close to buildings where both patients and
staff can go on daily walks. They also asked for
outdoor areas that are set up for sports, relaxation,
weight training, play structure, running, and biking, and outdoor shaded seating areas for staff.
Although there were inquiries for different
types of gardens, the most requested green spaces
were therapeutic and vegetable gardens. Most
interviewees indicated that attributes of a healing
environment as spending time with plants and
water features. These activities can reduce anxiety, provide positive distractions for patients, and
offer them opportunities to be involved in their
own recovery and healing process (Liddicoat,
2019). This can also allow staff to cope with
bereavement, process stressful work situations,
spend quality time, and work with adolescent
patients outside of the hospital building (Marcus,
2007). Therapeutic gardens should provide views
to the sky and changing cloud formations, a plentiful supply of plant materials with distinctive
seasonal changes, subtleties of color and texture,
with leaves or grass that move with the slightest
breeze (Marcus, 2007), as well as safe water features where patients can see and hear the water
but not drink it. Interviewees talked about the
benefits of gardening and planting vegetables to
be tremendous for patients as it could help them
practice acceptance, understanding the process of
growth, living in the moment, and eating healthy.
Safety and Security
Safety is a major factor in adolescent psychiatric
hospitals, as patients can become violent and
aggressive when irritated. Tense or escalating
situations often arise between patients in psychiatric hospitals in which staff members need to
intervene. Design features such as efficient visibility and circulation that maximizes line of sight
throughout the facility, reduces blind spots from
corridor nooks, and provides multiple exit points
112 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4)
that improve accessibility, as well as anti-ligature
equipment, durable and heavy furniture, and shatterproof windows (Carr, 2017).
Boundary. Physical indicators that define the use
of space can allow for different types and levels
of interaction by determining separations or
offering connections (Norouzi et al., 2019). A
nurse in Hospital C said, “boundaries are for connection as much as they are for separation [... ],
windows connect the patients to the outdoors
even on a hot day when they can’t go outside.”
The nurse continued by saying: Windows from
the patients’ room to the hallway offer safety and
privacy by allowing staff to check on patients
without entering the room. Boundaries for separation are essential for safety and security to keep
adolescents in their own healing environment and
away from adult patients and the public.
High risk. Equipment that can be used by patients
for self-harm are considered high-risk factors.
These can be eliminated with the appropriate use
of durable building materials, damage-resistant
furniture, and anti-ligature equipment (Carr,
2017; Shepley, 2017). The head nurse in Hospital
A described the importance of avoiding sharp corners and objects used throughout the unit in which
patients can use to harm themselves or others.
Visibility. Patient visibility and efficient circulation
are imperative when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital, as it has a direct influence on the
safety of staff and patients. A central nurse station
within an adolescent unit is crucial for providing
staff with maximum patient visibility (Shepley
et al., 2016). Although open nurse stations provide better visibility and support staff capability
to anticipate and prevent aggressive behavior
(Ulrich et al., 2018), most staff members at Hospitals A and C said that they feel safer in enclosed
stations. In other studies, decentralized nurse stations positively influenced proximity to patients
in a larger design footprint as well as time spent
with patients (Fay et al., 2017). Another important factor to consider are blind spots that can be
created by walls or furniture. Interviewees suggested the use of convex mirrors or cameras to
offer visibility. Although video surveillance
provides additional security and can increase
patients’ choice about monitoring options, it can
have adverse effects on patients’ well-being and
cause symptoms of fear, distrust, and paranoia
(Appenzeller et al., 2019). These dubious facts
are due to lack of imperial evidence and lead to
difficulty in considering video surveillance beneficial or hindering. We recommend that future
studies to consider representing adolescents in the
design of psychiatric hospitals by including them
in the interviews or surveys for data collection."
10.1016/j.asej.2022.101975,A framework for the design of pediatric healthcare environment using the Delphi technique,2023,"By investigating specific therapeutic goals and design considerations, this paper aims to develop a framework for the design of a pediatric healthcare-built environment. Growing body of research indicates that the characteristics of pediatric healthcare facilities differ from those of adult healthcare facilities, therefore the findings of adult healthcare facility design cannot be generalized to pediatric healthcare facility design. Moreover, the studies specifically focusing on the built environment in pediatric healthcare are also sparse. Literature studies were conducted to extract therapeutic goals and design considerations. Two rounds of the Delphi technique were used to extract the Indian experts’ opinions, and to make a consensus among the experts on each goal and design considerations. SPPS software was used to calculate statistical output i.e., mean, standard deviation (SD), Interquartile range (IQR), coefficient of variation (CV), and boxplots. Results were drawn with the help of statistical data and boxplots. Finally, eight therapeutic goals and 33 design considerations emerged which may contribute towards designing pediatric healthcare environments. The design considerations will aid architects and facility planners in making design decisions for new or renovated pediatric healthcare facilities. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","A healing environment aid recovery of the patient; reduce
patient stress, and length of stay in hospitals [1]; have both physical and non-physical parameters. The parameters of healthcare
environments include architectural design features; environmental attributes; air quality; noise; thermal comfort; privacy; natural light; outside view of nature; safety and security; and access
to nature [2]. The parameters of the pediatric healthcare environment also include the creation of child-friendly environments [3],
therapeutic play, family support and artwork for positive
distraction.
The parameters of a child-friendly environment have been
investigated in a variety of ways to determine what makes an environment child-friendly [3,4]. The childcare facilities should be
planned near schools and parks to have access to healthy, and safe
surroundings; and visual links between the indoor and outdoor
spaces are also important [5]. By incorporating the viewpoints of
children, the physical, cultural, and social environments can be
made child friendly. Children prefer to see healthcare facilities as
a home-like environment, which includes family eating and
kitchen facilities [6]. Experts also expressed the importance of
flooring in childcare facilities to prevent patient fall.
Nature and outside views, lower stress, allowing patients to
recuperate quickly [7] and influence patient well-being. Garden
visibility, accessibility, and the provision of child-sized furniture
are all essential factors in encouraging garden use [8]. The garden
visibility can be improved by placing colorful brochures in high
traffic areas [9]. In addition, the outside views from the window
can increase patient satisfaction [5].
Privacy during hospitalization can reduce anxiety, on the other
hand, insufficient privacy may cause children to get stressed. While
patients need privacy, staff members also need to see the patient,
ensure their safety and wellbeing [10]. The patient’s privacy may
be impacted by the space design, position of toilet and location
of the patient’s bed and its interactions with other design elements
[11,12].
Positive distraction has a significant effect in reducing patient
stress and is found to be beneficial for children [13,14]. The use

of artwork, realistic scenes can enhance the mood of hospitalized
children [15,16]. Installation of murals, virtual ponds, aquariums
has been found to have physiological effects on the positive health
outcomes of pediatric patients [17,18].
Play is critical for a child’s physical, social, and cognitive development. Shared, handheld play options pose a risk of infections,
however, aquariums, and interactive media provides play opportunities for differently-abled children [13]. Atriums, waiting halls,
hospital gardens and other public spaces be carefully designed to
provide self-directed play activities [19]. Younger children and
adolescents prefer distinct play zones based on their age and
developmental stage [20].
The psychological and emotional support of family to a pediatric patient has been explored by many studies and it has been
reported that the family has a significant role in the care process
[21]. It is important to provide spaces where both patients and
families can be effectively included in the patient room [22]. Children have more opportunities to do things i.e. play with toys, use a
computer, and mingle with peers when they are in age-appropriate
activity spaces [5,23].
Children must be kept safe from abduction and accidental collisions in childcare facilities. It is possible to create a safe environment with a sound-absorbing, slip-resistant floor by specifying
materials that are both attractive and functional [24]. Nursing stations should be located in such a way so that nurses can keep eye
on visitors [23].
A comfortable physical environment contributes significantly
towards faster recovery and better health outcomes. Pelander
[25], stressed the need of engaging the children in the process of
care. Single bed patient rooms are comfortable in terms of social
support and can substantially reduce noise and infection [26]. Adolescents feel discomfort with the crying of babies. Birch et al. [5],
suggested segregating the baby wards from the wards of
adolescents.
Healthcare institutions must evaluate their design quality, optimize health environment design to increase efficiency, and create
appropriate healing environments for patients. Although previous
research has shown that design has a major impact on health outcomes, evidence-based design is still in its infancy [27]. It is critical
for facility planners to address the experiences of sick children and
their families while in the hospital [28].
India’s growing pediatric population and rising affordability
highlight the need for better healthcare facilities in the country.
Despite having the highest percentage of children aged 0 to 18
(39 % of the country’s population), India only has a few pediatric
hospitals with basic infrastructure. Existing healthcare research
has mainly focused on general hospitals rather than on specific
hospitals i.e., pediatric hospitals and certainly not in the Indian
context. Children are not small adults, and their needs are different
in terms of their physiological and psychological characteristics,
the findings of adult care facilities cannot be replicated in pediatric
facilities.
In India, childcare is delivered in a variety of hospital type: general hospitals with pediatric departments; stand-alone children’s
hospital; and private clinics of pediatricians. There are many general and super speciality hospitals in the nation that treat patients
of all age groups. However, these hospitals lack specific environment needed to provide optimal care to infants, children with a
multidisciplinary approach centered on child. There are few stanalone children’s hospitals; two examples are 221 bedded, Chacha
Nehru Bal Chikitshalya (CNBC) in New Delhi; and 400 bedded
and Post Graduate Institute of Child Health (PGICH) in Noida, Uttar
Pradesh. Although these institutions offer improved childcare, they
fall short in many areas, such as creating a child friendly environment, therapeutic play, and family and peer support because there
are no guidelines in place.
The objective of this study is to create a framework for the
design of pediatric healthcare facilities in the Indian context, to
meet the industry’s pressing demand for making healthcare design
evidence more accessible and actionable. This study reveals how
pediatric healthcare surroundings have a major impact on patient
quality of care, safety, and staff satisfaction and efficiency. The
framework includes the design considerations for pediatric healthcare environments and can be used for design optimization for new
and renovation projects.
This article conceptualizes the healthscape quality of pediatric
healthcare facilities in India using the Delphi consultation methodology and provides a framework, supported by evidence on how
various factors affect the design quality. This construct considers
not just the conventional healthscape criteria (i.e., layout, ambience, and texture) but also new dimensions appropriate for designing pediatric healthcare institutions (i.e., child-friendly
environment; therapeutic play; artwork for positive distraction;
and family & peer support).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Delphi method
The Delphi method, developed at Rand Corporation in 1950 by
Dalkey and Helmer, is a widely used iterative process and accepted
method for convergence of opinion regarding real-world knowledge using a series of questionnaires requested from experts
within specific issue areas [29]. The main objective of a Delphi
study is to obtain consensus on the assessment of data from a
group of respondents. A chosen set of respondents is questioned
through a series of questionnaires and the results of the first round
are used to generate the next round. As soon as questions for which
respondent’s consensus are achieved, those questions are dropped.
The second round of questioning is used to further explore any
issues on which there is no consensus.
The size of the expert’s panel and the response rate of the
experts are important factors for Delphi consultation. According
to Skulmoski [30], when the group is small, a smaller sample
between ten to fifteen experts may yield sufficient results. There
is no strict rule for panel size [31], the author discovered that in
56 % of prior Delphi research, the number of participants was up
to 30.
Two rounds of the Delphi-based consultation method were
employed after the elements for design considerations were generated to reveal new aspects from Indian experts in related fields. In
this Delphi consultation, 30 experts were employed in round one
and 28 experts in round two. (Table 1). A 5-point Likert scale
was used to collect expert feedback. Finally, after a thorough examination of experts’ opinions and statistical analysis, the final design
considerations were compiled.
2.2. Identifying therapeutic goals and design considerations
A review of the literature was conducted to identify therapeutic
goals and design considerations. Using open-ended questionnaires,
five experts were asked to provide their opinion related to the
design of pediatric healthcare facilities to generate new ideas/concepts. This process yielded eight therapeutic goals and 34 design
considerations (Table 2). Through interviews with professors, caregivers/doctors, healthcare architects, research fellows, research
scholars and nurses feedback concerning pediatric healthcare
design was obtained and their suggestions were incorporated to
finalize the list of therapeutic goals and design considerations.
A. Halim Babbu and M. Haque Ain Shams Engineering Journal 14 (2023) 101975

2.3. Measuring consensus
Even though the primary goal of the Delphi technique is to
achieve consensus between experts, there is no consistent
measurement practice. As a result, some studies use a frequency
distribution to measure agreements, while others use standard
deviation and interquartile range [31]. According to Zervas [31],
10 points and 5 points Likert scale has been most commonly used
in the previous studies.
The consensus is said to be achieved by combining the following three measures in the case of a 5-point Likert scale.
a) The 51 % of experts who answered ‘‘strongly agreed” in the
category (which is between values 4 and 5 on a 5-point Likert scale)
b) The interquartile range less than 1
c) The standard deviation (SD) is less than 1.5 [31].
According to Dajani et al. [32], the Coefficient of variation (CV) is
another method of judging agreements. If the CV is in between 0
and 0.5, a good degree of consensus has been achieved and a second Delphi round is not needed; if the CV is in between 0.5 and
0.8, a consensus is less satisfactory and another round may be
required; and if the CV is 0.8, it has a poor level of consensus [33].

3. Results
SPSS software has been used to calculate mean, standard deviation (SD), interquartile range (IQR), coefficient of variation (CV),
(Table 2); and boxplots (Figs. 1-8).
3.1. Child-friendly built environment
It can be seen from Fig. 1, that A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7 have negative skew implying many experts awarded high scores compared
to the average, and the mean values are in the range of 4 to 5.
Table 2, and Fig. 1 shows good ratings (mean values), and good
agreement (IQR = 1.0 each), which indicates consensus in the first
round for A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7. Experts considered these factors
as important.
Positive skew is seen in A3, indicating a larger percentage of
participants provided a lower score than the mean. IQR = 2.0 indicates that experts have a weak agreement, a consensus has not
been achieved in the initial round. This factor was rephrased by
specifying the singly loaded corridor with the view of the outside,
which received a good score and strong agreement in the subsequent round. A6 has a lower score, week agreement (IQR = 2.3)
and negative skew in the first round. Even after rephrasing the
question, this factor didn’t achieve consensus in the second round
(IQR = 2.0), as experts found it unfeasible to provide a family
kitchen near-patient room in the Indian context, hence this factor
is not included in the final list.
3.2. Nature and outdoors
Fig. 2 and Table 2 show, all the factors scored high (mean value
# 4 to 5) and have a strong agreement (IQR = 1.0). Except for B3,
which has positive skew; B1, B2, B3, and B5 have a negative skew.
The CVs lies less than 0.2 which indicates a good degree of consensus and no need to go for the second round. Experts agreed that the
criteria: B1, B3 & B4 as important considerations.
3.3. Privacy
Fig. 3 and Table 2 indicates negative skew, high score, and very
strong agreement for C1. Privacy can be enhanced by providing
attached toilets in patient rooms. C2 has a very low score and
low median value, experts argued that providing all single-bed
patient rooms in the Indian context is not a feasible option, hence
this factor is not considered in the second round. C3 and C5 have
negative skew, high scores & strong agreement (IQR) in the first
round. Experts valued the installation of movable partitions in
shared rooms as an important criterion.
C4 and C6 have week agreements (IQR = 2.0) in the first round.
These criteria were rephrased. In the second round, C4 & C6 got a
high score, strong agreement, and CVs less than 0.16, which indicates consensus among experts. Inboard toilets provide better natural light and outside views to patient rooms.
3.4. Positive distraction
D1 achieved a high score, positive skew which means many
experts provided score lower than the mean but has got an acceptable level of agreement (IQR). Experts argued that the use of
brightly colored items are encouraged in pediatric facilities but
at the same time color choices differs among age groups. D2 has
got a low score and weak agreement (IQR) in the first round, so this
factor was rephrased, which received a high score and strong
agreement in the next round.
D3 and D4 received high scores, strong agreement, and negative
skew. Experts agreed that wall-murals, virtual ponds, aquariums
(D3), and drawing, and artwork can be used as a positive distraction strategy (Fig. 4, and Table 2).
3.5. Therapeutic play
Fig. 5 and Table 2, show that E1 and E2 both received high
scores, albeit E1 has a negative skew while E2 has a positive skew.
Both have received strong agreement (IQR), experts agreed to provide distinct play zones based on the type of activity & age group
(E1) and to provide non-contact play options to control infection
(E2). E3 did not achieve a high score in the first round. In the second round, so this factor was rephrased, as ‘‘allow play items
brought from home in the patient rooms"" which has got a high
score and strong agreement.

3.6. Family and peer support
F1, F2 and F3, all received high scores and overwhelming agreement in the first round. Fig. 6 and Table 2 show that F1 and F3 have
negative skew, implying a large percentage of experts ranked
greater than the average score. All three factors achieved consensus in the first round, and hence second round is not required.
Experts viewed the presence of family and interaction with peers
as an important characteristic.
3.7. Safety and security
Fig. 7 and Table 2 indicate that all the three factors have
achieved high scores, strong agreement, and positive skew,
which means that experts viewed all the three factors as extremely important in terms of child safety. Placement of nursing
stations in relation to patient rooms to have better visibility of
patients has been recognized as an important design
consideration.

3.8. Comfort
All the criteria’s related to patient comfort i.e., H1, H2 and H3
received high scores, strong agreement (IQR) and have negative
skew, which indicates that experts strongly agree with all the factors. Comfortable patient rooms, segregation of baby wards from
older patients, and nature views through windows have achieved
strong consensus among experts and therefore the second round
is not needed (Fig. 8 and Table 2).

4. Discussion
This paper used a qualitative and quantitative approach to
develop a framework for the pediatric healthcare facility. As the
pediatric healthcare facility design is complex & multi-faceted,
and the planning & decision making is also done by heterogeneous
groups [38], inputs from multi-disciplinary experts were obtained
to get a comprehensive perspective. The review of related literature and the opinion of the experts (concept generation round)
paved the way for the further development of questionnaires for
subsequent rounds of Delphi consultation. In the first Delphi
round, 34 design considerations were presented across 8 domains.
The data obtained from the first round of Delphi was analysed
using SPSS software, in terms of central tendency and level of
agreement among experts. 28 out of 34 items (82 %) achieved consensus in the first round. Only those items, which did not receive
consensus in the first round were presented in the second round.
C2 had the lowest score (mean value = 1.46) and strong agreement
(IQR), experts unanimously believe that providing all single bedded patient rooms is not a feasible option in the Indian context,
hence C2 was eliminated from the second round. Nine items were
rephrased and presented in the second round, and the result was
analyzed by SPSS software. The final list of design considerations
has 33 items in 8 domains (Table 3).
5. Conclusions
This paper investigated the therapeutic goals and design considerations related to pediatric healthcare settings by reviewing
the existing literature and with the support from participating
experts and design professionals using two rounds of the Delphi
and presented a framework for easy and effective implementation
of research evidence in design practice. The development of a
framework for pediatric facilities is a critical step in healthcare
research. This framework may be further expanded, validated for
better integration in the design decision process. These design considerations will aid architects and facility planners in making
design decisions for new or renovated pediatric healthcare facilities to improve the facility’s efficacy, performance, and aesthetics"

Natural elements in the built healthcare environment have shown to hold potential stress-reducing properties. In order to shed light
on the underlying mechanism of stress-reducing effects of nature, the present study investigates whether the stress-reducing effects of indoor
plants occur because such an environment is perceived as being more attractive.
Method. A single-factor between-subjects experimental design (nature: indoor plants vs. no plants) was used in which participants (n=77) were
presented with a scenario describing hospitalization with a possible legionella diagnosis. The study was conducted from March to May 2007 in the
Netherlands. Subsequently, they were exposed to a photo of a hospital room. In this room were either indoor plants, or there was a painting of an
urban environment on the wall. Afterwards, perceived stress and the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room were measured.
Results. Participants exposed to the hospital room with indoor plants reported less stress than those in the control condition. Mediation analysis
confirmed that indoor plants in a hospital room reduce feelings of stress through the perceived attractiveness of the room.
Conclusion. This study confirms the stress-reducing properties of natural elements in the built healthcare environment. It also sheds light on the
underlying mechanism causing this stress-reduction.
Introduction
Traditionally, healthcare facilities were built with the emphasis
on the functional delivery of health care (Ulrich, 1995). However,
since research supports the idea of the built healthcare environ-
ment having an impact the health and well-being of patients, more
attention is being paid to the psychological consequences of
architectural choices (Ulrich et al., 2004; Dijkstra et al., 2006).
Such ‘psychologically supportive’ healthcare environments are
also referred to as healing environments. This concept suggests
that the physical environment of healthcare settings ‘can make a

difference in how quickly the patient recovers or adapts to specific
acute and chronic conditions’ (Stichler, 2001, p2).
Three dimensions of the physical healthcare environment that
can have effects on health and well-being have been distinguished
(Harris et al., 2002): architectural features (e.g., spatial layout,
room size), ambient features (e.g., lighting, odors), and interior
design features (e.g., color, artwork, indoor plants). Interior
design variables provide relatively easy and inexpensive oppor-
tunities to alter the atmosphere of healthcare environments. This
applies especially to facilities that have already been built, but
may also be scheduled for renovation. The review from Dijkstra
et al. (2006) concluded that effects of interior design variables
appear to be highly inconsistent. The knowledge of specific
environmental stimuli and their effects on health and well-
being may facilitate atmospheric changes in an environment.
In addition, understanding the underlying processes causing
these effects may help us to design healing environments more

efficiently. A clearer understanding of the exact mechanisms
involved is necessary before we can implement such designs on a
larger scale.
Being hospitalized is generally associated with feelings of
fear, uncertainty, and anxiety (Mason et al., 1965; Pride, 1968).
These feelings of stress and anxiety may affect the healing
process. Research shows for example, that such psychological
stress impairs wound healing in patients (Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
1995; Broadbent et al., 2003). With regard to the idea of healing
environments, aspects of the built healthcare environment that
can reduce this stress may therefore have beneficial effects on
health-related outcomes.
Natural elements
Research on restorative environments suggests that certain
environments are capable of promoting recovery from stress,
and shows that especially natural settings have these restorative
effects (Hartig et al., 1996). Considering the potential healing
properties of nature (Ulrich 1984; Lohr and Pearson-Mims,
2000), exposing patients to natural elements may be an effective
way of reducing stress associated with hospitalization. However,
most healthcare facilities have been built in urban environments
and thus lack natural resources that patients can be exposed to.
Bringing nature into the hospital might be a good alternative to
reduce stress in patients and in turn aid their recovery.
Ulrich et al. (1991) studied the effects of exposure to nature
on stress recovery. Participants watched a videotape that in-
duced feelings of stress, and were afterwards exposed to a tape
with either a natural or an urban environment. Results demon-
strated that individuals recover sooner from stress when ex-
posed to the former (natural) than the latter (urban). A trial by
Diette et al. (2003) studied the effects of natural murals and
sounds on patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy. It was
found that pain control was better for patients exposed to nature.
Lohr and Pearson-Mims (2000) studied whether the presence
of indoor plants would increase pain tolerance. Participants
were either placed in a room with plants, a room with non-plant
objects (as visually distractive as the plants), or a control room
(no objects). Results showed that a significantly larger pro-
portion of respondents in the room with plants were able to keep
their hand in the ice water for 5 minutes as compared to the
other conditions, suggesting increased pain tolerance by ex-
posure to indoor plants. They also showed that the room with
plants was rated more positively (e.g., cheerful, calming,
pleasant) than either of the control rooms. The results of these
studies support the idea that indoor plants may have beneficial
effects on the health and well-being of people.
Natural elements in the built environment have clearly
shown stress-reducing properties, but it is still unclear which
underlying mechanism causes this stress-reduction. A potential
explanation lies in the theories by Kaplan (1987) and Ulrich
(1983), which state that people have a tendency to prefer natural
settings to built environments. Although these two theories have
some important differences (see Hartig et al. (1996) for a
discussion), both are based on the same evolutionary assump-
tions. The preferences for natural settings are assumed to have
an evolutionary base; people are to some extent biologically
adapted to natural as opposed to built environments. Secondly,
it might be argued that nature may be processed more easily and
efficiently because the brain and sensory systems evolved in
natural environments (Wohlwill, 1983). As a result, humans
have an innate tendency to pay attention and respond positively
to natural elements (Ulrich et al., 1991). This predisposition to
prefer natural elements to man-made objects may be the
explanation of the stress-reducing effects of nature. It might thus
be hypothesized that natural elements affect feelings of stress
through the perceived attractiveness of an environment.
The purpose of this experiment was thus to investigate
whether the stress-reducing effects of indoor plants occur
because an environment with indoor plants is perceived as being
more attractive. The following hypotheses will be tested:
H1: The presence of indoor plants in a hospital room leads to
reduced feelings of stress in patients.
H2: The perceived attractiveness of the hospital room mediates
this relation between plants and stress.
Methods
Design and procedure
The experimentemployed a single-factor between-subjectsdesign(indoor plants
vs. no plants) with participants being exposed to a scenario and a photo of a hospital
room. This procedure has been shown to accurately simulate real environments
Fig. 1. The photos of the hospital room (plants vs. no plants) used in the experiment
conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands.
(Stamps, 1990; Bateson and Hui, 1992). The meta-analysis by Stamps (1990)
showed a 0.86 correlation between environmental preferences obtained by photo-
graphs and preferences obtained by exposure to real environments.
The scenario described that participants had been hospitalized with
symptoms of a legionella infection. They were asked to imagine having a head-
ache, muscle pains and a fever several days after having gone swimming with
some friends. Their primary care doctor referred them to the hospital for thorough
testing and treatment.
In both conditions, participants were exposed to a photo of the hospital room
into which they were admitted. In the experimental condition indoor plants were
placed in the room, whereas in the control condition there were no plants but
there was a painting on the wall depicting an urban setting to generate a similar
level of distraction (see Fig. 1).
Participants
A total of 77 students (35 male and 42 female) with a mean age of 21 years
(SD=2.2) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control
condition. The study was conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands.
Participation was voluntary and a lottery with several cash prizes was used to
attract volunteers.
Measures
Attractiveness
To measure the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room, participants
completed a 10-item bipolar adjective scale (c.f. Lohr and Pearson-Mims, 2000;
Russell et al., 1981). Sample items include “pleasant–unpleasant”, “beautiful–
ugly” and “friendly–unfriendly”. The average score on this 5-point scale was
used as a measure of attractiveness (α=.92).
Stress
To measure perceived stress, participants responded to the 18-item stress
dimension of the Stress Arousal Checklist (MacKay et al., 1978) on a 4-point scale
(ranging from this word definitely describes my feelings [++] to this word doesn’t
describe my feelings [−]). Sample items include “tense”, “up-tight”, and “worried”.
The average score on this scale was used as a measure of stress (α=.94).
Statistical procedures
To test the first hypothesis that indoor plants in a hospital room effect to less
stress, an independent samples t test was conducted. To test the second
hypothesis that the perceived attractiveness of the room mediates this relation
between plants and stress, a mediation analysis using multiple regressions was
performed (Baron and Kenny, 1986). With a first regression analysis, the relation
between plants and stress was tested. A second regression analysis was per-
formed with the mediator (attractiveness) as the dependent variable and plants as
the predictor. Subsequently, in line with the procedure outlined by Baron and
Kenny (1986), it was tested whether the relationship between plants and stress
was mediated by perceived attractiveness. Therefore, yet another regression
analysis was performed with both plants and attractiveness as the predictors and
stress as the criterion. In the case of mediation, the previously found relation
between plants and stress should become insignificant, whereas the mediator
should retain its significance. Further support was given by means of a Sobel test
(Baron and Kenny, 1986; Preacher and Hayes, 2004). A probability of .05 was
the criterion used for statistical significance.
Results
Stress
An independent samples t test confirmed that participants in
the hospital room with indoor plants perceived less stress
(M=1.92, SD=.69) than participants in the hospital room with
the painting (M=2.30, SD=.75; t(75)=2.34, P=.022).
Mediation analysis
The first regression analysis, with perceived stress as the de-
pendent variable and the presence of indoor plants as the predictor,
yielded a significant relation (β=−.39, P=.022) with participants
perceiving less stress in the room with the indoor plants. A second
regression analysis, with the mediator (attractiveness) as the de-
pendent variable and the presence of plants as the predictor, showed
that the presence of plants increased the perceived attractiveness
significantly (β=.41,P=.017). Subsequently, it was tested whether
the relation between the presence of plants and perceived stress was
mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the room. Another
regression analysis was performed with both the presence of plants
and the perceived attractiveness of the room as predictors and
perceived stress as the criterion. This analysis revealed that the
previously found relation between the presence of plants and
perceived stress became insignificant (β=−.23, P=.152), whereas
the mediator retained its significance (β=−.38, P=.001), which
indicates partial mediation (see Fig. 2). Further support for this
mediating effect of attractiveness was found by means of a Sobel
test, which confirmed that attractiveness mediates the rela-
tion between the presence of indoor plants and perceived stress
(Z=−2.02, P=.042).
Discussion
The present experiment aimed to gain an understanding of
the underlying mechanism of stress-reducing effects of natural
elements in the built healthcare environment. Our results sug-
gest that the presence of indoor plants in a hospital room leads
to a reduction of perceived stress in patients. This finding sup-
ports the general notion that nature has stress-reducing proper-
ties (Ulrich, 1983; Ulrich et al., 1991). Most importantly, the
present results also demonstrate that these stress-reducing
effects are mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the hos-
pital room. The presence of indoor plants in a hospital room
leads to a higher perceived attractiveness of the room and this,
in turn, leads to reduced feelings of stress in patients.
The positive effects of indoor plants on the perceived at-
tractiveness of an environment (Lohr and Pearson-Mims, 2000;
Larsen et al., 1998) as well as on the feelings of stress have been

established in previous research (Ulrich, 1984; Diette et al., 2003).
The explanations of these effects of nature were mainly sought in
evolutionary theory (Ulrich et al., 1991), which states that humans
have a natural tendency to prefer natural elements to man-made
objects (Kaplan, 1987). However, to our knowledge the mechanism
by which exposure to nature may reduce feelingsof stress hadnever
been empirically studied. This experiment showed that the stress-
reducing effects of nature are caused by the perceived attractiveness
of the hospital room. This result would mean that, by basically
making the environment more attractive, healing environments can
contribute to the health and well-being of patients. Of course, there
are numerous waysto improve the attractiveness of a hospital room,
for example by changing the wall color. However, people vary in
their preference of color (Grossman and Wisenblit, 1999), and it is
therefore difficult to design a color scheme that is universally
attractive. Since people generally prefer natural elements, the use of
indoor plants in healthcare interiors thus seems a straightforward
and effective way to promote the patients' recovery.
Until now, most research on indoor plants in healthcare fa-
cilities has focused on health risks rather than on health benefits
(LaCharity and McClure, 2003). Indoor plants are a potential
source of bacteria through their soil and water and may cause
hospital-acquired infections, although this has not been
confirmed by research (Bartzokas et al., 1975; Siegman-Igra
et al., 1986). Clearly, the introduction of indoor plants in hos-
pitals needs to be closely monitored with respect to infection
risks, and other side-effects such as, for example, limited work-
ing space for medical personnel. Nevertheless, the healing po-
tential of indoor plants should not be overlooked.
One might argue that the findings of a simulation experiment
cannot be translated into actual healthcare settings. There is
evidence available, though, that photographs can accurately
simulate real environments and such studies show results similar
to field experiments (Stamps, 1990; Bateson and Hui, 1992).
Moreover, if exposure to an imaginary hospitalization and a
photo of a hospital room with plants is already capable of gen-
erating such a clear effect, this may be very promising for actual
exposure of hospitalized patients to indoor plants. Furthermore,
even if these effects only appeared in moderation in real
healthcare settings, such a simple and low-cost intervention may
well be highly cost-effective.
The current study employed a simple design by essentially
testing the hypothesis that plants make a hospital room more
attractive and that it is the attractiveness that reduces stress. In
future research the evolutionary explanation given for the effects
should be tested by including information processing or attention
measures. It will also be interesting to know which other envi-
ronmental stimuli are capable of affecting the perceived attrac-
tiveness of an environment, as well as whether pictures of plants
in a hospital room could generate similar results. This and the
other hypotheses obviously demand replication in field experi-
ments in healthcare settings with real patients.
Conclusions
All in all, this study confirms the stress-reducing properties of
natural elements in the built healthcare environment. Moreover,
it sheds light on the underlying mechanism causing this stress-
reduction. This experiment indicates that the stress-reducing ef-
fects of nature interventions in the built healthcare environment
are the result of a higher level of perceived attractiveness of such
environments."

psychiatric hospital in the Chaim Sheba Medical Center at
Tel-Hashomer, Israel, were conducted by a multidisciplinary
team of architects, mental health professionals, and adminis-
trators. The hospital contains three acute inpatient wards and
a day care and large outpatient clinic. Its operation began in
1991. This paper deals with the merging of “user-friendly”

an integral healing environment. The paper discusses the pos-
itive effects of specific components on patients and staff, and
suggests that our model of psychoenvironmental approach to
psychiatric hospital design can provide an important and ef-
fective tool in the pursuit of a humane, efficient containment
and reduction of severe psychopathology.

Introduction
We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.
(Sir Winston Churchill. TIME, Sept 12, 1960)
Mental health professionals have long speculated
that the physical environment in which treatment
occurs has an impact on both the treatment process
and its outcome [1–3], and they have paid increas-
ing attention to the interrelationship between this
Division of Psychiatry, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center,
Tel-Hashomer, and Sackler School of Medicine, Ramat-Aviv,
(R.G., Y.S., J.Z.) and Zarhy Architects LTD, Tel Aviv, (M.Z.).

physical environment and behavior [4,5]. However,
relatively little interest has been shown in the ther-
apeutic potential of psychiatric architecture [6].
The few empirical studies that evaluated the ef-
fects of psychoenvironmental design have shown
encouraging results. Higgs [4], for example, found a
decrease in pathological behavior following a move
of schizophrenic patients to a modernized unit.
Gabb et al. [7] demonstrated the positive influence
of the interior design of a public psychiatric facility
on the creation of a supportive, stabilized environ-
ment for schizophrenic patients. Christenfeld et al.
[8] showed selective behavior and attitude changes
among both staff and patients after transition to a
remodeled ward, as compared with matched con-
trol wards. Notably, one of the changes was a sig-
nificant decrease in the rate of patient violence.
Stahler et al. [9] found an increase in patient-staff
interaction and a decrease in pathological behavior,
together with improved morale among both pa-
tients and staff, after a remodeling of a psychiatric
geriatric ward. Whitehead et al. [6] measured be-
havioral changes in a clinically desirable atmo-
sphere subsequent to the redesigning of a psychi-
atric unit. These changes also correlated with
reduced psychopathology, probably secondary to
the betterment of staff-patient contact.
Some authors [10] suggested that even minor
architectural changes can lead to significant im-
provement in how the setting functions, with pos-
itive effects for patients, staff, and families. Sommer
and Ross [11] reported, in one of the earliest works
on this issue, a doubling of the rate of social inter-
actions among geriatric patients following the rear-
rangement of furniture in a day room. Minde et al.
[12] showed similar effects of restructuring a day
room on psychosocial functioning, as well as on the
stealing, and acting out in a psychiatric hospital for
adolescents.
Findings from the above-mentioned studies, as
well as other publications, support the speculation
that altered physical design variables, consistent
with treatment philosophy, would be associated
with favorable changes in staff and patient percep-
tion of ward atmosphere [1], and would have a
therapeutic value [6]. Indeed, congruence between
patient and staff perceptions of psychiatric wards
has long been considered a necessary factor for

tinous with the lawn.

atric Hospital.
quality of life, also in psychogeriatric patients. Co-
rey et al. [1] proved that even simple redecoration
of the psychiatric ward, such as changes in furni-
ture style, floor covering, and color scheme, could
have a favorable impact on staff members’ and
patients’ perception of the psychosocial milieu.
Another architectural change that reportedly
might bring clinical benefits is structural division of
the ward into smaller units. Wilson et al. [13]
showed that structural division provided contain-
ment of incidents and reduction of vandalism,
100-item true/false questionnaire that is easily ad-
ministered to patients and staff, and specifically
assesses their perception of psychiatric inpatient
treatment environment along three dimensions: re-
lationship variables, treatment variables, and sys-
tem maintenance variables [1].
Another measurement instrument is the Behav-
ioral Environment Assessment Technique, which is
derived from ethological studies and measures
ward behavior. The procedure has proven effective
in several studies of psychiatric patients [5,16] and

effective system functioning, although at least one
study showed that those perceptions were higher
for staff than for patients, and challenged the belief
that such congruence is an indicator of program
quality. In fact, the authors [14] believed that to
expect congruence of perceptions may be unrealis-
tic.
To measure the psychosocial atmosphere of treat-
ment environments, investigators often use the
Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS), which was devel-
oped by Moos and Houts [15] in 1968. This is a
in assessing change among them [17]. Thus, the
positive effect of the so-called healing environment
on psychiatric patients can be measured by valid
tools and not recognized merely by global impres-
sion.
An important finding in the study by Whitehead
et al. [6] was that length of patient stay was not
substantially affected by the ward redesign. This
observation is meaningful because it is sometimes
argued that providing a humane clinical setting
will hamper staff efforts to discharge patients be-
cause of resistance to leaving the ward. Indeed, we
may assume that in a healing environment the pa-
tients are more likely to improve clinically faster,
and get discharged sooner.
It is clear from this review that attention to the
design of the physical environment of a psychiatric
hospital can provide major support for patients and
their treatment programs [18], as well as for the
staff and families. Cooperation between architec-
ture and psychiatry is therefore essential [10], and
should be maintained during each phase of a
project [19]. French psychiatrists Sivadon [20] and
Amiel [21] simultaneously assumed the responsi-
bility of relating to, and actively participating in,
the design process of the healing environment. The
results of their pioneering experiments, and their
implementation, can be seen at La Verriere Hospital
near Paris [22].
In view of the conception that architecture is a
tool in the therapeutic process, the design and ex-
ecution of the psychiatric hospital in The Chaim
Sheba Medical Center in Tel-Hashomer, Israel,
were conducted by a multidisciplinary team of ar-
chitects, psychiatrists, and other mental health pro-
fessionals and administrators, thus including the
consumer as an active element in designing the
facility [22].
The hospital contains three acute inpatient open
wards, a day care clinic, and a big outpatient clinic.
Its operation started in 1991. This has provided
enough time to evaluate the influence of the design
features on the patients’ well being and the recov-
ery process.
The Psychiatric Hospital is an integral part of the
biggest medical center in Israel. Its location within
the premises of a medical center allows ongoing
interrelation and dialogue between the medical
staff of the Division of Psychiatry and that of the
other wards. The psychiatrists provide regular
consultation-liaison services to the latter, and con-
sult with physicians from other wards on nonpsy-
chiatric medical issues. Patients suffering from both
mental and physical disorders, which are often in-
teracting and share reciprocal clinical impact, are
benefiting daily from this arrangement. The loca-
tion within a general medical center also facilitates
the routine use of laboratory and brain imaging
services, thus enhancing the level of medical care.
In addition, it symbolizes the medicalization of psy-
chiatry and alleviates the obvious apprehension of
patients and their families regarding admission to a
psychiatric institute.
The daily clinical observation by the staff leaves
no doubt that the patients enjoy their physical en-
vironment as it offers them a safe, comfortable,
nonthreatening, and readily comprehensible set of
surroundings. The messages sent by the physical
environment convey sincere respect for the patient
and sensitive concern for his or her physiological
and psychological well-being, which are important
contributors to the therapeutic process [23].
The design of the inpatient wards adheres to the
basic set of guidelines for ward design: patients are
not overcrowded or overconcentrated, so they are
not forced to interact with too many people. They
are given the opportunity to retreat physically
when they feel threatened, and to form beneficial
relationships [24]. The latter is achieved mainly by
providing a variety of spaces that support social
interaction [18], such as a big day room, a dining
room that is well lit and ventilated [19], and spa-
cious lobby and corridors, whose design resembles
that of a living room with residential furniture
rather than commonly used institutional pieces.
The open porches of this one-story building are
almost continuous with the lawn that surrounds
them, thus providing further spaces for social inter-
action, and creating a free and unthreatening atmo-
sphere while at the same time helping to define
space. Generally, it seems that patients and staff
react positively to the classical daylight and fresh
air.
The nurses’ stations are located in front of the
day rooms, separated by big windows that are usu-
ally open. It is noteworthy to mention that an im-
portant negative finding in the study performed by
Whitehead et al. was the small number of patients
who spent their time near the open nurses’ station
[6]. Nurses often fear that patients will abuse their
easier access if the nurses’ station is open. The data
in this study prove this fear to be unrealistic. More-
over, it appears that the openness of design may
encourage staff to leave the station and spend more
time in the day room [6].
The building is well kept, with meticulous daily
maintenance, and repairs are carried out promptly.
This is essential, especially when vandalism or ac-
cidental damage occurs; constant maintenance dis-
courages more destruction [19].
Safety in the psychiatric setting involves many
aspects of facility design [25]. To mention a few,
most of the patient living area can be easily ob-
served by staff, lighting in the patients’ rooms is
sufficient for adequate staff observation during
evening and night hours, there are many exits
which could be used in case of an emergency, and
the building is equipped with smoke detectors and
fire extinguishing equipment.
As already mentioned, environmental conditions
are important to the efficiency of the staff operation
[22]. The staff’s working and resting areas are seg-
regated and are provided with separate entrances,
yet are easily accessible to patients and their rela-
tives. Thus, boundaries are defined without sug-
gesting alienation. It is unanimously agreed by all
staff members that the physical environment in the
psychiatric hospital contributes also to the quality
of life and sense of professional dignity of the work-
ers.
The humane, efficient containment and reduction
of severe psychopathology is a major goal shared
by hospital designers, clinicians, and administra-
tors [6]. Our model suggests that a psychoenviron-
mental approach to psychiatric hospital design can
provide an important and effective tool in that pur-
suit, and supports the prediction that a planned
environment may favorably impact both patient
and staff.
The concept that “medical care cannot be sepa-
rated from the buildings in which it is delivered,”
and that “[T]he quality of space in such buildings
affects the outcome of medical care” [26], is gaining
increasing attention. This concept holds true espe-
cially in the case of psychiatric wards. Once in the
domains of a general hospital, the psychiatric ward
might suffer from the tendency of hospital archi-
tects and designers to focus on providing adequate
space for new technology, and on maximizing func-
tional efficiency [26]. It is the role of psychiatrists
and other mental health workers to redirect the
focus of ward design to the patients and their fam-
ilies, the consumers of hospital services. The psy-
chiatric unit of the general hospital offers unique
opportunities for the psychiatrist, nurse, adminis-
trator, architect, and designer to pool their talents
for the benefit of patients with mental disorders
[27].
As Sir Winston Churchill’s [28] aphorism implies,
buildings are shaped by people for people. When
well shaped, they can help ailing people get into
better shape.

It is concluded that the built environment of the ST contributes reminders to staff to fulfil the necessary procedures of aseptic technique, to ensure the safe passage of the patient through surgery into a condition where s/he may be designated as ""healed"".

INTRODUCTION
The surgical operating theatre or operating room (henceforth ST) will be familiar to many people through popular media images. Surgeons seem will- ing to allow television crews into their theatres on the least pretext of some new breakthrough, while T.V. fictions set in hospitals routinely use the dra- matic setting of the ST with its unusual dress codes and physical organization. However, few operating theatres are now built to incorporate the viewing galleries which provided their U.K. name, and the opportunities for those not directly involved in sur- gical operations to witness precisely what occurs in these spaces has consequently diminished.
The impact of the spaces of the built environment upon health and health care have been documented by many authors, and a number of approaches are discernible in these studies.
1. Studies of the impact of health care environment upon perceptions, experiences and well-being, including patients' recovery. For example, ward design has been analysed in terms of the creation of a ""healing"" (Biley, 1993) or ""therapeutic"" (Cotton and Geraty, 1984) environment, or in terms of staff preferences (Trites et al., 1970).
2. Interactionist studies which examine the impact of architecture on the engagements between people who inhabit the spaces. Rawlings found problems of communication between personnel working in a surgical sterilization unit due to physical boundaries in layout (Rawlings, 1989). The spatial allocation of patients in a casualty department was analysed in terms of doctor/
nurse interactions by Hughes (1988).
3. Structuralist approaches in anthropology and so- ciology examine how spaces and movements
within spaces mirror or otherwise symbolically represent the activities which go on in them. Turner's (1968) study of the Ndembu people explored rites de passage associated with sickness which entailed complex movements, while Ardener (1972) considered the use of spatial iso- lation in the liengu rite used to heal seizures among the Cameroonian Bakweri. Rosengren and DeVault (1963) examined the spatial arrangements of obstetrics, and passing mention of the spaces of surgery is made in Hirschauer's (Hirschauer, 1991) analysis of surgical bodies. Studies within this tradition may distinguish between ""ritual"" and instrumental activities, and seek to disclose a ""deep structure"" beneath the surface manifestations of the interactions (Levi- Strauss, 1986).
The approach adopted here might be best described as ""post-structuralist"", in that it eschews any notion that the built environment is determin- ing of behavior, or that there is a one-to-one con- gruity between architecture and the intended function of a space. Post-structuralism is interested in power and its relationship to knowledge, and the built environment may contribute to a ""knowledge"" of such things as how to behave, who may behave in certain ways and who is ascribed particular privi- lege. Such an approach emphasizes the ""reading"" of spaces by actors rather than the ""writing"" of behavioural imperatives within the physical structure of the built environment (Fox, 1993). Thus, in certain circumstances, architecture may make avail- able to actors a skein of signs with which they can
support their discursive activities. For example, Prior writes that the design of health care spaces
,..can be best understood in relation to the discursive practices which are disclosed in their interiors. The architecture of the hospital is therefore inextricably bound up with the forms of medical theorizing and medical practice which were operant at the hour of their construction.... all sub- sequent modifications to hospital design can be seen as a product of alterations in medical discourse (Prior, 1988, p. 110).
Spaces may thus offer cues to actors as to how they might engage with the environment and with others. On the other hand, they are not themselves ""discursive"", in that they may be read in ways other than those in which they had been ""written"". The built environment is adaptable, and in no way determines action or behaviour. To understand the significance of space in surgery we cannot depend upon analysis of the spaces themselves, but must look at the meanings ascribed to the spaces, and how the spaces are used to facilitate behaviours and routines.
While not wishing to suggest any theoretical similarity between Goffman's approach and post-structuralism, the former's emphasis on the symbolic use of space in his (Goffman, 1959) notions of front (public) and back (private or exclusive) space seem particularly relevant to the study of the ST. Back spaces are those exclusively occupied by staff or ""insiders"" (doctors and nurses in a hospital, actors and stage crew in a theatre, priest and acolytes at a church service) and the normal rules of behaviour or decorum of an institution which invites the ""public"" into its front spaces may be absent or moderated in the back space. Back spaces are necessarily defined in opposition to front spaces, and are both exclusionary (of outsiders) and inclusionary in that they define ""insiders"" and facilitate different kinds of interactions to go on within them. Definitions of spaces as ""front"" and ""'back"" are contingent and mutable, usually at the discretion of the ""insiders"".
The ST is one of the most inaccessible ""backspaces"" of the modern hospital, often sign- posted in code to further reduce the possibility of the casual unwelcome visitor. The fabrication of spaces which help to exclude outsiders may thus not only separate the ST physically from an other- wise relatively public space: the hospital, but permit interactions within the back space of the ST to be distinct from those which go on elsewhere in the building, freed from the intrusion of (conscious) patients and other outsiders.
This paper draws on ethnographic material collected by the author in U.K. operating theatres and associated spaces (Fox, 1992), to examine the effect that the spaces of the ST may have upon inter- actions.* The first part of the paper is taken up with a description of some details of the physical spaces which constitute the ST, and this leads to an analysis of the impact of the built environment of the ST upon the sterile procedures of surgery. The analysis suggests how physical boundaries and barriers enable, and help to constitute, a regime of sterility which organize sets of movements through the surgical spaces: movements of bodies, staff and instruments. These circuits of hygiene (a phrase acknowledging the dictionary definition of ""hygiene"" as a ""system of rules for promoting health"") are ""sufficient"", yet not ""necessary"". Rules can be broken, and indeed variability in ST layout indicates that architecture is no more than an adjunct, a resource to bolster understandings of what should happen in the ST.
The three circuits of hygiene of patients, staff and instruments supply a backdrop for the drama of surgery, the process by which a patient is subjected to a surgical intervention, be it the removal or repair of a tissue or body part. The significance of the circuits, and of the spaces through which they pass, need therefore to be considered in relation to surgical resection. The paper follows the movements of a patient through the surgical space during a ""typical"" operation, to elucidate the contribution of the circuits of hygiene, and of ST architecture to achieving sterile, safe surgery.

THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT OF THE OPERATING THEATRE
The data reported in this study were collected principally at a large teaching hospital, here called General Hospital. At this hospital, surgery is car- ried out in 10 operating theatres, which are organized into five twin suites. There is diversity in layout even at this one hospital, and thus it may be expected that other facilities may further diverge; however there are some core features of the architecture which may be discerned from Fig. 1. At General Hospital, six theatres had congruent de- signs. Two others were congruent except that the scrub area was not divided from the operating area. The two plastic surgery theatres were designed around a central sterile corridor which separated anaesthetic room and ST.t
The design of the ST is arranged around the central core area of the sterile corridor. The entrance to this corridor is clearly marked as off-limits to patients, visitors, and staff not authorized to enter, and form the principal barrier and boundary to the ST. Within this barrier a second set of doors marks the boundary beyond which sterile conditions are supposed to apply, and within which precautions
are taken to reduce the numbers of infective organ- isms present• Because floors are disinfected, person- nel passing through the inner doors must first put on plastic overshoes which are available in a box between the two sets of doors. Observations of life within the ST suggest that the institution of the sterile corridor is the principal means of defining the surgical space as separate from the rest of the hospital.
Nursing staff bringing patients to theatre use this route• However, most of the personnel based in the ST use a different means of access. Either between the two sets of doors, or via a discretely marked staff entrance, access is obtained to a staff corridor, which leads to changing rooms. Changing rooms contain washing and toilet facilities, and stocks of sterile clothing. Suitably garbed, personnel are able to enter the sterile corridor via an internal door from the changing rooms. These are the ""back spaces"" of this ""back space"".
Each theatre within the twin suite possesses its own anaesthetic room and scrub areas, but shares instrument preparation and disposal facilities. These latter spaces are situated between the two theatres of a suite, and provide a means of access between theatres without passing through the sterile corridor. This area, consisting of theatres and instrument preparation areas, along with scrub areas, forms the inner sanctum within the ST, to which access is limited to specific personnel• The ""clean side"" instrument preparation area is accessible from the sterile corridor, and here sterile instruments from a Central Sterile Supplies Department (CSSD) in the hospital are unpacked and arranged on sterile trolleys which are subsequently wheeled into theatre via a corridor between the STs. Used instruments are returned to the ""dirty side"" via a hatchway towards the rear of each ST, to be replaced in the packs in which they arrived and returned in due course to the CSSD. Scrub areas contain washing facilities and stocks of sterile gowns, gloves and masks for use by surgeons and scrub nurses.
The other areas comprise a recovery room for post-operative patients, and areas for use by staff: offices for doctors and the theatre sister, a rest room, and equipment stock rooms. The ST is thus virtually autonomous of the hospital, and in some STs where all-day lists are conducted, arrangements are made to provide snack luncheon for staff obviating the need to leave the ST between 9 a.m. and late afternoon. Telephones situated in the sterile corridor and in the offices, and the bleep system permit limited contact with the outside world to be maintained, although it can also effectively be kept at a distance by claiming pressure of urgent work to be done in the ST. Informants told the researcher that one of the pleasures of working in surgery was the inaccessibility. The effect which a sterile corridor has on separating the ST from the outside was noted by informants:
Infection Control Nurse: Danger of infection will be used as the excuse for all the expense (of architectural arrangement), but these precautions are also very effective in keeping unwanted people out of theatre.
Within the ST, the operating table is centrally placed. A movable anaesthetics trolley is situated to one end, and is connected to various pipes providing oxygen and anaesthetic gases. The orientation of the patient is therefore limited by the need for anaesthetic access, and the surgical and anaesthetic areas of the theatre are mutually exclusive.
SPACE AND STERILITYIN THE ST
Sterility is a key element in organizing activity within the ST area, and can be analysed as three concentric spaces of increasing hygiene.
1. The general environs of the ST, comprising the areas described earlier, and marked out as off- limits to any except those involved in one way or another in the activities of the ST. In this area, some efforts are made to adopt sterile procedures, for example, avoiding contact with sur- faces by street clothing or shoes.
2. The ST itself, which may be entered only by those garbed in surgical clothing comprising ""greens"" (linen shirt and trousers or skirt), clogs or boots, a cap or surgical hood, and in theory at least, a surgical mask. Clothing supplies are provided in the changing rooms which may be accessed through entrances to the ST complex avoiding the sterile corridor. These changing rooms are contiguous with the ""outside world"" and are thus ""liminal"" in status (Turner, 1968).
3. The ""sterile field"" surrounding the operating table and the patient. Anyone approaching this area should wear a surgical gown, sterile rubber gloves and a surgical mask. Furthermore, all personnel in this area must first have undergone the ritual of scrubbing the hands and forearms. The gloved hands must not touch anyone or anything which is not sterile, including mask or cap. Patients are considered to be non-sterile, and will be transformed into ""sterile objects"" by draping with towelling from neck to toe. Parts of a patient immediately adjacent to the site of the proposed incision area are washed with a disinfectant such as iodine, after which further sterilized towels are draped so as to leave a small rectangular area of skin exposed. A sterile adhesive plastic material may then be stuck to skin and surrounding towels, so that incisions are made through this membrane and underlying skin, enhancing the sterility of the area immediately adjacent to the wound. Towelling may be augmented by a non-porous paper barrier placed under conventional cloth towelling. The use of towelling or sterile plastic sheeting to create a barrier extends to drapes for any piece of equip- ment which is to be above an operation, such as an X-ray machine in orthopaedic surgery, or a microscope for plastic surgery. It is worth noting that while most sterile practices are intended to protect the patient from the surgical environment (including personnel), surgical garb may also be a protection for staff against contamination by patients with blood-borne diseases such as hepa- titis and HIV.
Those who work in the spaces of the surgical enterprise must learn the rules of the ST, many of which concern the sterility of the theatre and surrounding areas. Asepsis is a technology for the exclusion of infective agents which might contaminate the sterile inside of the body during surgery, and the development of the built environment of the ST over the past 100 years reflects the developments in antisepsis and asepsis (Trites et al., 1970; Fox, 1988). It requires that all objects which come into contact with this sterile field (instruments, clothes and bodies) must be as far as possible germ- free, as should the air and other contents of the environment of the surgical operation. In practice of course, complete asepsis is impossible, and the procedures are nowadays usually complemented by pre-operative injections of antibiotics.
The built environment of the ST is thus crucial for this aseptic technique in two ways. Firstly, it de- marcates the sterile area from the general septic environment of the hospital. Thus, within the precincts of the ST, sterile practices must be observed, and the meticulous rules of dress and behaviour are required of all who inhabit the spaces.* Secondly, the ST environment affects the movements of personnel, patients, and instruments which are ""permissible"" according to rules of steri- lity. These are partly built into the architecture of the ST; in this sense, the built environment is poten- tially a ""guarantor"" against inadvertent compromise of aseptic procedures. I call these rules of movement, the ""circuits of hygiene"".

THE CIRCUITS OF HYGIENE
In this section I consider the movements of things and bodies in the ST in detail, and how these ""circuits of hygiene"" interact with the spaces of the built environment. While these movements may be understood as a set of technical rules for aseptic procedure, I would suggest that we can see in the circuits of hygiene something more: part of a ""covenant"" (Laufman, 1990) between staff and patients to operate safely. The circuits of hygiene are thus rhetorical markers which indicate that what is being done can be labelled as a form of healing. I would suggest that such markers are valu- able because surgery is a risky business, and often (and almost always in elective surgery) both the subjective experience of the patient and the clinical view is that strictly speaking a patient is ""more ill"" after the operation than before: suffering pain and discomfort from the wound, from the physiological after-effects of the anaesthetic, and perhaps emotional distress. In the extreme, the patient may die as a result of complications resulting from surgi- cal and/or anaesthetic intervention.
Each circuit of hygiene represents an imperative by which the hygiene of surgery is maintained and promoted. The direction of movement ensures that successful hygiene ensues. ""Hygiene"" is used here in a double sense. In the narrower sense, hygiene con- sists of the science of sanitation, cleanliness and sterility. This may be designated hygieneI. However, the roots of the word ""hygiene"" are wider: accord- ing to a dictionary definition, ""hygiene"" was the knowledge and practice which concerned itself with the promotion and protection of health, deriving from Hygeia, goddess of health and daughter of Aesculapius in Greek mythology. This is hygiene2. This wider notion of hygiene as health is appropri- ate to the understanding of the procedures con- ducted in the ST, concerned as they are with the restoration and promotion of health in patients undergoing surgical healing. While the circuits of hygiene pertaining to staff and instruments act to ensure hygiene, they are also concerned with hygiene: the transition of the patient from her/his unhealthy status prior to healing to a more healthy status as healed. The patient's own circuit of hygiene, her/his movement through the surgical space
to perform this status passage, is concerned foremost with hygiene. 
In Fig. 1, arrows indicate the direction in which
instruments, staff and patients usually move. There
are no rules in the forms of signs or physical impe-
dimenta to govern which directions are permissible,
although of course barriers in the form of architec-
tural construction limit possible movements. Yet
there clearly appear to be conventions which lay down how staff, patients and instruments may move; it would be considered extremely unusual

(and probably dangerous) were a patient or an instrument to move in an unconventional direction. For example, while the scrub room may be used as a thoroughfare, it is conventional (partly to avoid disturbing patients awaiting anaesthetic induction) that the anaesthetic room is seen as the domain of anaesthetists and their assistant nurses, and is not used by other staff to access the ST, even when no patient is present. The arbitrariness of some con- ventions pertaining to staff are more obvious: the legitimacy of an activity may indeed depend upon where or by whom it is carried out.
Field Notes: A trainee paramedic went for a coffee-break during an operation. He returned with cups of coffee for consultant anaesthetist Dr B and the researcher.
Dr B (to the researcher): You had better take yours out- side. It is only consultants who are allowed to drink their coffee here.
However, conventions can be altered:
Surgeon Mr P: At G (a new private hospital), when com- missioned, a red line on the floor demarcated sterile areas in the ST. However, the inclusion of the coffee-room within this boundary prevented surgeons' colleagues drop- ping by for coffee, thus disrupting a convention of hospital sociability. The red line was quickly re-painted to exclude the coffee room from the sterile area.
To separate the three circuits is somewhat artifi- cial, as it is their interaction and concurrence which contributes to the overall hygienic regime. The cir- cuits pertaining to staff and instruments will be described first, followed by a more lengthy descrip- tion of the ""patient circuit"" which necessarily involves staff and instruments.
The staff circuit
The division of labour within the ST means that different staff have differing ""circuits"", and the fol- lowing account recognizes some of these variations.


Personnel working in the ST (surgeons, anaesthe- tists, theatre and anaesthetic nurses, operating department assistants (ODAs), students and auxili- aries) enter the suite along the non-sterile staff cor ridor, the entrance to which is outside the inner doors to the sterile corridor (SC). From the staff corridor they can enter the men's and women's changing rooms, which are equipped with lavatory,  washing facilities and shower, and in which are supplies of sterile clothing, shoes, masks and caps.  Personnel discard their street clothes, although it seems acceptable to retain socks, underwear and tights. Theatre clothes can be quite revealing, and the whole procedure of changing seems to separate the ST from the outside, with its conventions of modesty. Surgeons who go on to the wards wearing theatre greens take care to fasten the side vent of their trousers which usually reveals bare flesh in the ST.
Once changed, staff may enter the sterile area, which includes rest rooms, office, stores and tele- phone in addition to theatres and associated facilities. The kitchen is an ambiguous area in which sterile personnel prepare coffee, while access is also possible from the (non-sterile) staff corridor for auxiliaries who perform domestic duties. As noted earlier, the main access to the ST is via the scrub areas or the entrances by which patients are removed from theatre following their operation. Anaesthetists and their assistants tend to use the anaesthetic room as their means of entry and egress from the ST, except when accompanying a patient from the ST.
Ward nurses and porters do not work in the ST area, and are seen as outsiders, although theatre staff are dependent upon them for providing the daily flow of patients. Porters bring patients into the sterile corridor through the main doors, and thence into the anesthetic room, accompanied by a nurse from the patient's ward. While the latter puts on overshoes before entering the sterile area, porters at General Hospital appeared to be exempt from this rule, possibly because unlike ward nurses, under very rare circumstances would they enter the theatre itself.
Following completion of their duties, staff pass back through changing rooms into the non-sterile world, discarding used greens in laundry baskets in the changing rooms.
The instrument circuit
Instruments begin their circuit in the preparation
room, where they are removed from the wire bas-
kets in which they have been brought from the hos-
pital CSSD. For a particular operation there is a
designated complement of instruments which will be
required, and it is the theatre sister's responsibility to ensure that the correct set are ordered in advance
of the procedure. On occasions, delays result when sets of instruments have not been delivered in time for the designated procedure, patients are rescheduled or a surgeon changes a procedure (for example, from an investigation to an excision of tissue). 

Instruments are brought from the instrument preparation room laid out on towel-covered trol- leys. These are positioned such that they can be accessed by the scrub nurse, often on gantries over the recumbent patient. Unscrubbed nurses will open packages containing sterile contents such as dispo- sable syringes, swabs and any prosthetic devices to be used. The outside of these packages are non-ster- ile, so they are designed so that the sterile contents will drop out on to the sterile surface, where they can be accessed by the scrub nurse.
The scrub nurse passes sterile instruments to the surgeon, and no other personnel may come into contact with sterile instruments or towels, or sterile personnel.
FieM Notes: During a procedure an extra pair of hands was required to retract the skin layer of a particularly obese patient during an operation, in order to gain satis- factory wound access. This task required considerable strength, so because of a shortage of nursing staff, I was asked to assist by holding the skin retractor. Because I was not scrubbed, I could not touch the retractor, and there was no time for me to scrub. So a piece of sterile bandage was tied to the eyelet of the retractor (which is shaped like a pair of scissors) and 1 was given the other end of this bandage to pull. A subtle means of breaching, yet technically sustaining, the sterile/non-sterile distinction was thereby devised.
Some instruments will be used more than once during an operation, but any instruments which have lost their sterility, by contact with the skin, or with gastrointestinal contents, will be discarded. Discarded instruments are deposited in a dirty tray, while those not deemed to have lost their sterility may be laid to one side (for example, a scalpel used to cut the muscle layer, which is seen as sterile). Dirty instruments are dispatched to the ""dirty side"" via the hatchway, thus following a different route out of theatre from that by which the clean instru- ments entered.* This completes the instrument cir- cuit.contact with sterile instruments or towels, or sterile personnel.

The patient circuit
In the following section I have documented aspects of a ""typical"" elective operation, collapsing many such operations observed during the period of fieldwork. 
A patient due for surgery is brought from his/her ward to the ST by a porter, accompanied by a
ward nurse. On the ward, the patient has been
dressed in an operation gown, and transferred from his/her bed to a trolley for transport to the ST. For a very minor operation involving local anaesthesia, the patient may be brought to the ST in a wheelchair: this was only observed in the Plastic ST and the endoscopy clinic (a non-sterile theatre). Once within the boundaries of the ST, no patient may walk, they are always passive objects.
The patient is wheeled into the anaesthetic room on the trolley. In most STs, this trolley, which brought the patient from the ward (and is therefore non-sterile), is used to move the patient into theatre via the anaesthetic room. However, in the ST designated for thoracic surgery, patients were transferred in the sterile corridor from the ward trolley to a sterile trolley kept in the ST area: this system of transfer is now more widespread. Once in the anaesthetic room, the ward nurse talks to the patient while anaesthetist and assistant prepare the anaesthetic. The patient may have received a pre-operat- ive sedative on the ward, consequently some patients have to be woken up in order to be sure the general anaesthetic puts them to sleep. The anaesthetist checks the case notes, which have been brought with the patient under her/his pillow. These will be the responsibility of the anaesthetist from now until the patient enters the recovery room, when they will be handed to recovery nursing staff.
Based on patient weight, the dose of anaesthetic (often including an agent to achieve muscle paralysis) is calculated, and injected via a cannula inserted into a vein in back of the hand. As the anaesthetic is administered a veil of silence falls over all in the room. All focus their attention upon the eyes of the patient; as they close and the anaesthetist checks for unconsciousness, the tension evaporates. The blankets are whisked away, while the anaesthetist attaches a face mask to the patient, and connects a ventilator bag with which the patient's respiration is maintained manually until connected to an artificial ventilator in theatre; this bag is squeezed by the as- sistant or anaesthetic nurse to breath the patient. The ward nurse departs.
The anaesthetized patient is wheeled through the closed doors at the far end of the anaesthetic room into theatre, and the patient transferred by the anaesthetist and assistant (or other handy person- nel) to the operating table. The anaesthetist now connects the patient to the artificial ventilator, and selects the anaesthetic to be used during the oper- ation, which come as canisters of volatile agent attached to the mobile trolley. The patient's contin- ued anaesthesia will thus be assured, and monitor- ing of the patient is now achieved by connection of electrocardiograph (ECG) leads to provide pulse, respiration and heart rhythm information via a monitor mounted above the anaesthetic trolley.
The operation begins with the construction of a sterile field as described earlier, entailing towelling over all but the immediate site of incision. Surgery begins with the skin incision, which may be carried out by a junior member of the surgical team, who may also be invited to open the muscle layer in the case of ,bdominal surgery. Once the consultant or senior surgeon begins work, the focus of activity becomes the sterile field and the operative pro- cedure. Although other activities are taking place (continuity of anaesthesia and monitoring, checking fluid loss, ordering blood products, arranging sub- sequent operations), these must not impinge upon the focus. Unscrubbed personnel must guard against contact with the sterile field, and be ready to move non-sterile equipment such as the micro- scope, lighting and stools for the surgeon.

There is a timeless quality to these periods--little
happens which can be described other than as the
slow proceeding of the operation. The anaesthetist 
continues to monitor the patient and from time to time may make a note or speak briefly with the sur- geon about the patient's condition. When surgery is minor there may be conversation, and often the boredom is alleviated by banter or general conversation on matters of professional interest. During major surgery there is little conversation except between the surgeon and assistant.
When the procedure has been completed, and muscle and skin suturing begun, the surgeon informs the anaesthetist that the operation is over. The latter times the ending of anaesthetic procedures to coincide with the completion of wound closure and dressing: reversing the effects of muscle paralysis, ceasing the administration of anaesthetic gases and substituting 100% oxygen to awaken the patient. Dressings are supervised by the consultant surgeon but often applied by the assistant surgeon. Surgeons then depart, and used equipment is cleared away. Monitoring equipment is detached, and the patient is lifted on to the trolley, which has been brought back into theatre. A blanket is placed over the patient, and s/he is addressed by the anaesthetist, ""Wake up (name)..... it's all over"" and is asked to cough: s/he once again has an identity. The patient is made to say something, to assert his/ her agency, but most likely will then go back to sleep for a considerable time. The patient is wheeled out of theatre by the anaesthetist and assistant, via the side doors, into the recovery room, where nur- sing staff are continually present to observe the patient, The anaesthetist checks the patient's pulse and hands the notes written up during the operation with details of heart rate, respiration, and the drugs given, to the recovery nurse.
The recovery space is still within the ST boundary, and seems to possess characteristics of a half- way house for those who work there.
Nurse A: They (ward nurses) don't like you in recovery. You're in-between.
Anaesthetie nurse: You're definitely in-between.
While in recovery, the anaesthetist retains authority over the patient, and--often on the advice of the recovery nurse---decides when the patient can return to the ward, or occasionally, be moved to the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU). Thus a surgeon has authority only when the patient is on the operating table, and the anaesthetist is responsible for the induction and recovery periods. If recovery is without incident, the patient is eventually trans- ferred back to her/his ward by a porter and ward nurse. In this way, the patient circuit is completed.
DISCUSSION
In the previous sections, the movements performed by patients during surgery have been described in detail, placing surgery in the context of the processes by which a patient is conducted through the surgical places of the ST. The circuits of hygiene contribute to what Laufman (1990) has suggested is a ""covenant"" between staff and patient to provide appropriate asepsis and thus ""safe"" surgery. They ""guarantee"" that the patient arrives at the moment when surgery begins in a condition which is intended to ensure that the operation does not unintentionally increase the ""illness"" of the patient through infection. S/he is disinfected and sterile towels are draped. Instruments are sterilized, and the people who are to wield them undergo rou- tines to ensure that as far as possible they do not introduce infective agents into the wound. These procedures are time-consuming, yet they are recog- nized as essentials. Corners cannot be cut, and the routines are accepted by all involved as legitimate uses of staff time and resources.
The circuits of hygiene thus bring together patient, instruments and surgical staff in one place, in conditions which minimize the risks that surgery brings to a patient. Not only do they achieve this, but they assure that they are seen to have been achieved. The circuits mark the efforts of all to make surgery a safe procedure, one which will not increase disease, a circumstance which would be hard to match with the idea of surgery as a form of healing.
Because of the necessity for sterile preparations to be achieved without fault, the surgeon is dependent on the rest of the team to ensure that the patient comes to her/his knife in a ""hygienic"" state (in the broader sense of hygiene2, that is, in a ""healthy"" condition), Surgeons do not oversee the entire procedure, which from the early morning washing of the ST floors with disinfectant are aimed to achieve asepsis, or some approximation to it. They retire to their office, they let the theatre staff get the theatre to its state of readiness for surgery to occur. Then the surgeon is involved her/ himself, in scrubbing, and in overseeing the preparation of the patient. Even though the direct intervention by the surgeon is limited to the surgical intervention, s/he takes responsibility for the patient as soon as s/he arrives on the operating table. Responsibility is returned to the anaesthetist after the wound has been dressed, at which point the circuits of hygiene resume, with the moving of patient, dirty instruments etc.
The circuits of hygiene are central to the team effort of surgery, and the spaces of the ST contribute to ensuring the team works effectively. The circuits routinize these efforts, they remove responsibility from the surgeon for overseeing the entire proceedings, and assure her/him that all has been done to enable healing to take place safely. Hygiene2, the requisite for surgery to be a form of healing, depends on routines of hygiene~carried out by theatre staff, over whom the surgeon has no direct control. Yet when the surgeon approaches the operating table, the rhetoric of the circuits of hygiene assures her/him that all has been done
according to the rules of asepsis, and that s/he may operate with maximum certainty that her/his intervention will not endanger the patient by infection. Without this assurance, the intervention would be classed not as surgery, but as physical assault. For the status of the surgeon qua surgeon to continue, the circuits of hygiene must be successfully per- formed.*
The built environment of the ST is thus not essential to surgery. One surgeon in the study commented that he could operate in the middle of a corn-field, and it would probably be a lot safer. But the architecture is a reminder to staff to adhere to sterile procedure. It can be ""read"", and contributes to the routines necessary for safe, sterile surgery. The spaces of the ST are thus a product not just of surgical technology or medical discourse (Prior, 1988), but of the continuing interactions of people and things which have developed in the procedures of modern surgery. And, while the contribution of the built environment may scarcely be apprehended by those who occupy and use them, these surgical spaces contribute substantively to the daily achievement of the tasks which take place within them, in this case, the enterprise of surgical healing. For those involved, it may contribute to their corresponding subjectivity as ""healers""."
10.1038/sj.jp.7211584,The role of positive distraction in neonatal intensive care unit settings,2006,,"Introduction
Historically, noise, light and infection control have been the
primary focus of health-care environmental design research. In the
early 1980s, however, research on a cluster of physical dimensions
was initiated which, instead of addressing the molliﬁcation of the
negative aspects of the environment, switched the focus to the
creation and reinforcement of positive experiences. These
experiences were designed to allow one to project oneself into the
environment outside the healthcare setting – typically a less
hostile and more nurturing space. The focus of this new research
had the common theme of providing positive distraction, or the
ability to allow the individual to shift focus from negative foci
within the health environment to the more restorative aspects of
the non-medical world.
Several environmental psychologists have addressed the role of
positive distraction relative to human need and preference. Clare
Cooper Marcus, Steven and Rachel Kaplan, Jay Appleton and Roger
Ulrich have formulated theories regarding positive distraction in
the context of their areas of specialization. For example, in Roger
Ulrich’s Theory of Supportive Design,1 he cites three signiﬁcant
factors which will help patients, family and staff cope with stress
and, in turn, result in improved health outcomes: increased sense
of control and access to privacy, social support and access to
positive distractions.
Environmental variables that are most commonly known to
contribute to positive distraction are art, access to nature and
music. The literature on these topics is discussed in the following
article, followed by design guidelines that provide suggestions as to
how to apply the principles to real environments.
Literature review
Art/color
Although art has been incorporated in hospitals since the early
14th century, its purpose has changed. In lieu of preparing patients
for death, or serving to increase donations, works of art now
serve to address ‘a more holistic approach to medicine’.2
Acknowledgement of the role of art in healthcare settings has
become mainstream and discussions of the implications of this
environmental intervention take place in widely circulated medical
journals.3
If art is to be used for positive distraction, the choice of genre
(e.g., modern, primitive or representational) and topic is critical.
Regarding genre, Ulrich4–6 noted that postoperative patients
preferred representational pictures over abstract works. Part of this
response might be associated with the topic portrayed in the images
and part associated with color choice. Representational art tends
to incorporate the subdued colors of the natural environment,
whereas abstract art is often surprising in the color composition.
Ireland, Warren and Herringer7 found that anxious individuals
prefer less saturated colors, therefore, color may be a contributor to
the impact on the viewer.
Environmental Competence/Press Theory8 implies that
individuals will seek less challenging environments as they become
stressed. When one’s internal emotional stimulation increases,
a stressed individual will seek a less stimulating external
environment, in order to balance the overall experience.
Zuckerman, Ulrich and McLaughlin9 noted that abstract work was
more often preferred by high sensation seekers. This would suggest
that more representational work would be preferred by individuals
seeking a less stimulating environment. If individuals in
healthcare settings are trying to reduce the intensity of the visual
The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a stressful environment for both
families and caregivers. Positive distraction is a means of mitigating stress.
A review of research reveals that several factors in the physical environment
can contribute to positive distraction, the most prominent of which are
nature, art and music. Design interventions that provide positive distraction
and can be introduced into the NICU setting are window views of pleasant
outside vistas, soothing artwork and the ability to listen to music.

experience and achieve greater sensory control of their
environment, they might prefer more representational work.
Several abstract artists have argued that abstract art is not
necessarily perceived negatively all by patients. Some research
shows that previous exposure to art genre may inﬂuence
preference, as young children do not prefer one type over the
other.10 As such, providing patients and families choices regarding
the art that is placed in their environment is an important
consideration.
Nature
Kellert and Wilson, Steven and Rachel Kaplan and Roger Ulrich
have engaged in intriguing discussions of the origin of our
motivation to be associated with nature.11 The term ‘biophilia’ was
coined by Dr Edward Wilson, an evolutionary biologist and refers to
‘the innately emotional afﬁliation of human beings to other living
organisms’.12 Wilson suggests that, when the opportunity to
associate with nature is limited (as is typical in health-care
settings), the biophilic impulses are disrupted. Steven and Rachel
Kaplan suggest that certain preferences for nature are pervasive
human qualities, and are signiﬁcant because of their role in
human evolution. Good interactions with and understanding of
nature served to enhance human survival.13,14 Adjunct to the
Kaplans’ theory is that preference is directly related to human
perception and categorization behaviors which enable the
individual to acquire more information. According to this
hypothesis, nature views are most preferred when they provide
information and simultaneously enable the viewer to be located
at a safe (from predators) vantage point.
Dr Ulrich cites access to nature as a primary means of
distraction. Ulrich15 studied moderately stressed individuals, and
found that more positive feelings resulted when these individuals
were exposed to nature scenes than when they were exposed to
urban scenes. Additionally, Ulrich1 found that exposure to videos
of nature were more restorative than urban scenes, after viewing
a stressful movie. Physiological measures included pulse, skin
conductance, muscle tension and heart period.
People appear to believe that access to nature may affect health
outcomes. Olds16 conducted a study in which workshop participants
were asked to draw images of spaces where a sick individual might
go to be healed. Seventy-ﬁve percent of respondents drew scenes
of the outdoors and included nature elements and vistas, light
animals and beauty.
The presence of windows is an extension of the concept of access
to nature. Windows may impact a patient’s health outcomes and
psychological condition.17 In Ulrich’s comparison of post-surgical
cholecystectomy patients, he found that views of trees, as opposed to
the brick wall of the adjacent building, resulted in better patient
progress, less use of analgesics and shorter length of stay. In
another study, patients who viewed nature pictures had less
postoperative anxiety,18 and nature curtains with accompanying
natures sounds, resulted in better bronchoscopy pain control.19 The
impact of windows on the attentional fatigue of intensive care unit
(ICU) nurses has also been studied.20 Although opposition to an
increase in the number of windows may be a result of concern
about increased construction costs, McKahan17 gathered data
indicating that the average savings (when considering decreases in
operational costs associated with improved health outcomes owing
to views of nature) would be as high as $118 per patient day.
Windows are more than openings in an exterior wall, and must
be considered for their size and proportion. In a comparison of
window and windowless hospital rooms, Verderber21 found that
windows that are very small, distant or high, were not thought of
as windows at all. Where windows may not be possible, access to
natural light may have a positive impact. Residential sunlight was
found to be associated with lower frequencies of breast and colon
cancers.22 Lowered average length of stay and mortality was found
in myocardial infarction patients who were located in sunny
rooms.23
Regarding interior spaces that will accommodate interaction
with nature, Burnett and Hamilton24 suggest providing a space for
plants and a window seat. When the patient rooms are on the
ground ﬂoor, a greenhouse space can be added adjacent to the
room, which should be maintained from the exterior.
Gardens are a primary opportunity to provide access to nature
in a hospital setting. Medieval hospitals were often designed around
courtyards25 and the ancient Greeks incorporated spas with water
elements among their building types. The use of gardens in
contemporary hospitals was less common until the 21st century.
A set of post-occupancy evaluations of hospital gardens conducted
by Cooper Marcus and Barnes26 found that, of the people who used
the gardens, they normally visited the space at least once per day.
The vast majority went there to relax and reported positive mood
changes including spiritual experiences and stress reduction.
Pet therapy (interaction between animals and patients in a
healthcare setting) is a means of positive distraction and a form of
access to nature. Although the opportunities for pet therapy in a
neonatal ICU (NICU) setting may be limited, several studies have
conﬁrmed the beneﬁts of this activity. Interaction with pets has
been found to reduce perception of pain27 and improve perception
of quality of life.28
Music
Music may elicit a psychoneuro-immunological response, although
this has not been conﬁrmed. Several studies suggest that music,
especially when controllable, can reduce anxiety or stress and
helps some patients cope with pain.29,30 Music has been employed
to reduce stress or mitigate noise in several ICUs31–35 and
Routhieaux and Tansik36 found that music reduced self-reported
stress levels in ICU waiting rooms. With regard to infants, the
studies on the impact of music and mother’s heartbeat are
conﬂicting. The presence of music and subsequent withdrawal
of music may actually have complex implications. Standley and
Moore37 found that on the ﬁrst day of exposure to music, infants
had signiﬁcantly higher oxygen saturation levels, but these effects
diminished on subsequent days. Furthermore, babies exposed to
music had signiﬁcantly depressed oxygen saturation levels after the
music was terminated.
There has been conﬂicting information as to which type of
music (e.g., classical, jazz, pop and alternative) might be most
appropriate for healthcare settings. Evidence from environmental
psychology, however, would suggest that choice in selection is at
least important as the genre. One of the common characteristics of
patients and their families is a lack of sense of control. Choice of
music may enhance a sense of control and help them to achieve a
healthy state of mind.
Minimally, music can be a distraction, and if the distraction
deﬂects from focusing on the negative aspects of the healthcare
environment, it should be considered. In the case of noisy intensive
care environments, it can additionally serve to provide ‘white noise’
to mask disturbing NICU sounds.
Design guidelines
One of the shortcomings of design research is the lack of
communication between researchers and those who create
environments. As such, it is important to identify the physical
implications of the research. Some of the guidelines in the
following discussion are reported in the Recommended Standards
provided elsewhere in this issue, others are the suggestions of this
author.
Art
Regarding permanent art displays, it may be safer to provide
realistic or ‘gentle’ abstract art. In situations where art displays can
be changed, depending on the preference of the infant’s family or
the NICU staff, options should be provided for multiple genres. The
provision of an art cart from which patients select art to hang in
their rooms is a tenet of the Planetree philosophy,38 a program that
supports patient-centered care.
Apart from genre, the subject matter is important. Generally
it is recommended that works of art communicate a soothing
experience or provide nature content. Lastly, it is important to
remember that the art preferences of designers, who typically have
extensive exposure to contemporary art, may be different from
those of laypersons. Therefore, the population who will be
experiencing the art should be consulted during the selection
process.
Nature
There are three principle ways to provide access to nature. The
ideal situation would be to provide NICU family members and staff
with access to gardens, outdoor spaces and atria. Cooper Marcus
and Barnes26 provide the following guidelines regarding hospital
garden design:
 interior and exterior environments should contrast with one
another,
 construction and plant materials should account for
handicapped accessibility and the potential hypersensitivity
to microclimate,
 spaces should provided which are imbued with qualities of safety
and security, to compensate for the distressed state of the users,
 sensory stimulation should allow for an external focus,
 the design should allow for both psychological and physical
journeys, and
 areas should allow for night group interaction and soliloquy.
Minimally, all staff and families should have views outdoors
through windows somewhere on the unit. In the case of families,
they are best located in infant rooms and the waiting area. In the
case of physicians and nurses, views should be provided from the
lounge (where staff retreat for respite) and the nursing station
(where staff spend extended periods of time). When that is not
possible, natural light can be brought in through skylights,
supplemented by art that includes nature images.
Music
As mentioned above, no speciﬁc genre of music is a prescription for
healing, however, music which is enjoyed by an individual may
serve as a positive distraction. The design recommendations are as
follows:
 provide access to music or white noise for patients and their
families; it is critical that the potential listener have a choice in
the presence or absence of music and, when it is available, be
able to select a particular type of music; an option would be to
provide equipment which would allow the patient or their family
to bring their own music selection,
 sound levels should not disturb other patients or their families,
and it is recommended that head phones be provided, and
 music can be provided in stafﬁng lounge settings, assuming it
does not interfere with alarms or communication.
The potential stress-reducing impacts of positive distraction are
demonstrated by the research on this topic. It is likely that stress-
reduction may have a role in supporting the immune system.
Minimally, positive distractions are desirable by NICU families and
staff and will enhance satisfaction with the physical environment.
Although art, nature and music are options for achieving these
effects, other contributors are possible and should be explored.
Proponents of positive distraction suggest that health-care
environments cannot be fully enhanced if they are limited to
mitigating the negative environmental dimensions. In addition to
these important modiﬁcations, positive distractions should also be
provided."

autophotographic study centred on: the quality of the ward design,
human interactions, the state and quality of personal space, and
facilities for recreation and leisure. The novices suggestions were
organized into categories of elemental factors representing patient-
friendly designs. Experts from the architectural and surveying
professions and staﬀat SRHT in turn considered these categories
and respective subsets of factors. They agreed with the novices in
terms of the headings but diﬀered in prioritizing the elemental
factors. The questionnaire survey of past patients provided opinions
about ward designs that varied according to where they stayed,
single room, bay ward or long open ward. The main concerns
were limitation of private space around the bed area, supportive of
privacy and dignity, ward noise and other disturbances.
Conclusions Patients perceived sustainable health-care environ-
ments to be supportive of their health and recovery. The design
indicators developed from their perspectives and from their consid-
erations for improvements to the health-care built environment were
based on their visions of the role of the health-care facilities. These
were homely environments that supported normal lifestyle and
family functioning and designs that were supportive of accessibility
and travel movements through transitional spaces.
Introduction
According to the new modernizing approaches
to health put forward by the Department of
Health,1 and the NHS Plan2 service provision
and
health-care
built
environments
must
develop a patient-centred strategy and focus
upon the things that really matter to patients.
This ﬁts well with notions of sustainability in its
application to patient-centred hospital building
designs and facilities provision. This is suppor-
ted in the 2004 NHS improvement plan,3 which
sets out the key commitments that the NHS will
deliver to transform the patient’s experience. In
terms of health-related aspects of the sustainable
development paradigm, the built environment of
health-care is crucial to the well-being of current
and future patients and other stakeholders.
Much of the literature on patients perceptions
of factors that aﬀect their health relates to
standards of care.4–6 There is little research into
patients perceptions of hospital built environ-
ments speciﬁcally, the nature of the range of
factors that they consider important to their
health and well-being and how health-care built
design appraisals can incorporate their consid-
erations into the design brieﬁng and evaluation
process.
The research was carried out at Salford Royal
Hospitals NHS Trust (SRHT), a large acute
teaching hospital in Salford, Greater Manches-
ter, UK. Planned comprehensive redevelopment
of
the
hospital
under
the

Investment

project
involves substantial redevelopment of the main
hospital site and the provision of four primary
care and social centres at locations across the
City of Salford designed for seamless delivery of
health-care. This research was commissioned in
light of these planned developments to ascertain
patients perceptions about the built environ-
ment of hospitals so as to inﬂuence the design
process and the planning stages.
Enhancing value by design appraisal
Design appraisal relates to the process of exam-
ining a project, of whatever built form, against an
agreed set of criteria that reﬂect a range of con-
siderations, perspectives and interests. Its pur-
pose is to identify critical area during the design
stage, increase conﬁdence across the stages of

it
involves the assessment and evaluation of a pro-
ject at the design stage for conformity against
standards, technical speciﬁcations and codes.
Thus, such appraisals address issues relating to
quality, health and safety, regulatory compliance,
environmental
considerations
and
speciﬁed
operational requirements of eﬃcient operational
applications. Nevertheless, by looking beyond
technical conformity and compliance indicators
to consider the added value of community and
personal perspectives of the stakeholders of
interests, including the developer, client and end
user, further value can be added and utility
enhanced during the operational phase. The
research carried out for the Commission for
Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE)
and the Department of the Environment and the
Regions supported the view that good designs
produce economic and social and environmental
values.7
Researchers in landscape design and the
architecture disciplines emphasize that people
are sensitive and responsive to the environ-
mental information that they receive from the
built environment and provide useful insight
into the need for planning responsive humane
design.8–12 Research in the USA and the UK
has
begun
to
identify
the
contribution
of
patient environments to health and well-being
and patients recovery from illness; thus, well
designed health-care environments can posi-
tively inﬂuence health outcomes.13–15 Lawson
and Phiri’s study of architectural health-care
environments
compared
the
outcomes
of
patients referred and treated in new or refur-
bished hospital wards with that of similarly
referred and treated patients in older hospital
environments.16,17 The designs of the internal
areas and transitional spaces within health-care
facilities should be appraised to ensure that
they satisfy the needs of patients and their
families. Poor design has been linked to neg-
ative health eﬀects, including increased anxiety,
greater need for analgesic medications, sleep-
lessness and higher rates of delirium.18–20 Var-
ious design appraisal tool kits of procedures
and step-by-step checks by which to carry out
project design appraisal are available to the
architectural profession and the construction
and
property
development
industry.
Never-
theless, there has been a paucity of UK evi-
dence-based research that relates speciﬁcally to
patients views and design appraisal indicators
that reﬂect their perceptions of the built health-
care environments.
Aims and objectives
The main aim of this research was to investigate
how patients and their families perceived the
built environments of NHS Trust hospitals. Its
purpose was to explore their perceptions and
their views about diﬀerent areas within a hos-
pital
and
their
requirements
for
quality
improvements in the internal hospital areas and
its external areas, including landscape and aes-
thetic considerations. The aim was to identify
and evaluate their considerations for sustainable
future designs as they envisaged them and from
this to develop a set of patient-centred appraisal
indicators to supplement existing tool kits used
in the sector. Key objectives of the research
were:
• to develop an understanding of patients
experience within the hospital built environ-
ment;
• to explore patients considerations of sustain-
able design for built health-care environments;
• to
identify
factors
that
inﬂuenced
their
experience within that environment;
• to identify and evaluate the attributes that
they considered contributed towards a sus-
tainable patient-friendly environment; and
• to develop a patient-centred indicator set for
appraising built health-care designs.
The built environments in the case study hospital
The SRHT, an acute teaching Trust in Salford
in the north-west of England provides local,
regional
and
national
services
and
has
approximately 900 beds and employs 3500 staﬀ.
It was established in 1994 after the relocation
of Salford Royal Hospital onto the existing
Hope Hospital site in 1993. This was followed
by further expansion to include the nearby
Ladywell Hospital onto the site in 1999. Thus,
SRHT
became
a
predominantly
single-site
Trust. The overall quality of the built envi-
ronment of the hospital reﬂects its current
infrastructure, which comprise a mixture of
Victorian buildings, outmoded ward stock and
piecemeal
development
of
new
blocks
and
facilities following the major relocations to the
site. These factors inﬂuence patients, visitors
and stakeholders perceptions, their experiences
and their subsequent views and opinions of the
built environments of the hospital and how it
aﬀects them.
The hospital was selected for the research
because of the planned comprehensive rede-
velopment of the site under the SHIFT pro-
ject. This came out of a visionary approach in
the UK health-care sector based on the notion
of a whole systems model of care that puts
the NHS Plan into practice in transforming
local health and social care infrastructure. This
involves a complete redesign of services to
improve patients experience and to deliver
more accessible, eﬀective and responsive care.
The
investment
project
of
approximately
£200 million
comprises
separate
aspects
of
physical redevelopment and a shift in service
provision.21,22 The built environment aspect of
the project should thereby reﬂect a patient-
centred focus in its design and function to
meet the sustainability objectives of the health
service plan.
Methodology
The research method was based on separate
strands of qualitative and quantitative research
designs. The qualitative strand used four inter-
pretative methodological approaches. The ﬁrst
comprised 50 one-to-one personal interviews,
reported in a separate paper.21 The second
involved an autophotographic study in which a
sample of 35 patients were asked to take pho-
tographs of situations that represented their own
interpretations and impressions of what they
found good or bad about the hospital environ-
ment. The methodology was based on frame-
works
used
previously
in
social
science
research.23–25 One digital camera was used and it
was passed from one patient to the next as
required. Several patients who were conﬁned to
bed took photographs from their beds. Most
were able to walk around their wards and some
walked further away, along the corridors, into
day and utility rooms and sometimes around the
wider hospital site.
The third approach used a novice-expert
cohort technique. This approach, based on an
adapted qualitative Delphi approach,26 facili-
tated engagement between selected groups of
novices and experts about their respective
views and their rankings of nominated ele-
mental attributes necessary for patient-friendly
environments. Novices were people, who may
have been a patient in a hospital or may have
visited a family member, friend or colleague
but who did not work in or have direct links
with a hospital. Forty novices were asked to
nominate the initial elemental attributes that
they
considered
necessary
for
a
patient’s
friendly hospital environment. Experts were
professionals with expertise in areas of the
health-care built environment. They were ran-
domly selected from a sample drawn from the
membership lists of the Royal Institute of
British
Architects
(RIBA)
and
the
Royal
Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and
from staﬀat SRHT. The fourth of the qual-
itative method themes involved a series of
futures conferences in which rapid appraisal
workshops were held with focus groups that
were both linked to, and independent of, the
hospital. The groups that were linked with
SRHT comprised patients support and vol-
untary workers who met periodically at the
hospital to discuss present and future health-
care concerns with the hospital’s executives.
The independent group had no direct link with
SRHT and comprised groups of local residents
drawn from across the City of Salford. Five
conference groups were undertaken with the
linked groups at SRHT and three with the
independent group.
The quantitative strand of the research com-
prised a postal questionnaire survey to 2200 past
patients of SRHT. A stratiﬁed sample was
drawn from a sample frame of patients who had
been discharged during the ﬁrst week of each
calendar month from December 2000 to August
2001 inclusive. Approximately 500 patients were
discharged each week but because of the exclu-
sion criteria set by the hospital and the Ethics
Committee patients that were seriously ill, those
with certain speciﬁed illnesses, treatments or
situations, and those going onto hospices were
excluded from the sample. The survey was car-
ried out over two mailshots, which together
generated 785 completed useable returns giving
a response rate of 37%.
Results
Perspectives from the qualitative themes
Autophotographic study
The photographs that were taken show that
there was much similarity in the issues and fac-
tors that patients captured on camera across the
four departments. Patients took pictures that
centred mostly on the quality of ward design
(36.5%), types of human–environment interac-
tions (23%), the state and quality of their
personal space (17.4%) and facilities for recre-
ation and leisure (15.8%). The views reported in
ensuing discussions with researchers were that
the environment of the internal areas of the
hospital aﬀected their feelings of well-being.
Their likes of the environment, items, situations
and activities as represented by the photographs
reﬂected the factors and inﬂuences that made
them feel comfortable and able to keep a sense
of normality (Table 1). The photographs that
represented their dislikes were reﬂections of the
things that they found annoying and in many
cases those which compromised their privacy
(Table 2).
Novice-experts
The novices provided an extensive range of
suggestions,
which
were
analysed
using
an
itemized theme analysis approach similar to that
of the thematic framework suggested by Miles
and Huberman.27 The common elements were
extracted into 25 categories, all with their prin-
cipal elemental factors. Experts from the archi-
tectural and surveying professions and staﬀat
SRHT considered these elemental factors, which
were in turn discussed by both novices and focus
groups. The principal factors that emerged from
these prioritizing interactions were: good signage
and way ﬁnding; controllable lighting for a
natural and homely environment; privacy for
patients
dignity,
conﬁdence
and
assurance;
reduced noise levels in internal and external
areas; temperature control for personal comfort
and relaxation; access to the natural environ-
ment, including views of nature; safety and
security in internal and external areas; internal
and external children’s play areas; accommoda-
tion
for
visitors
and
relatives;
shops
and
personal services; good around the clock cater-
ing facilities; and good landscape designs with
seating and garden areas.
The futures conference groups
At each of the eight focus group meetings, in
order to encourage free and open discussions, a
representative set of photographs taken by the
researchers to show the hospital’s internal and
external areas were shown in a presentation and
were also mounted around the room in which
group
discussions
took
place.

Perspectives from the quantitative theme
Of the postal survey returns, 31% of respond-
ents had been in hospital between 1 and 3 days,
19% stayed 4–5 days, 35% stayed between 6
and 14 days and 15% more than 2 weeks. In
terms of the type of ward in which they stayed
during
their
hospitalization
periods,
36.9%
stayed in a two to four bed bay, 28.8% stayed in
a long, open ward, 21.8% stayed in small bay
wards that were clustered around a nurses
station and 12.5% had a single room. Nearly
half the patients (48%) were admitted to the
hospital for surgery; the next largest group
(39.1%) were referred for medical care. Only a
small number had been admitted to the mater-
nity and elderly care wards (0.5% and 2.7%
respectively), and 9.4% declined to record rea-
sons for admission.
The results of the quantitative strand of the
research complemented the qualitative theme.
The respondents views about the hospital were
positive and they were generally satisﬁed with
the facilities provided. Opinions about whether
the design of their rooms/bays was patient-
friendly varied according to the type of ward in
which they stayed. Patients in single rooms and
those who stayed in small bays clustered around
a nurses station reported being most satisﬁed
with their environment. Nearly one-third of
those respondents who had stayed in a two to
four bed bay and a long, open ward were fairly
satisﬁed as opposed to completely or very sat-
isﬁed (Table 3). Negative responses were chieﬂy
in relation to the room/bay at night. Respond-
ents frequently reported annoyance with the
level of noise and disturbances during the night.

The greatest level of night-time disturbance was
reported by patients who were in the small bays
clustered around a nurses station (20.2%), fol-
lowed by those in long, open wards (18.3%) and
two to four bed bays (16.8%). One in 10 of those
who had stayed in a single room were dissatisﬁed
with this during the night. By far the largest
issue mentioned by respondents who felt that the
environment was not patient-friendly was space,
and particularly the lack of space between
patients
beds.
Limited
space
aﬀected
the
amount of privacy that they enjoyed and it was
also seen as an issue in accommodating their
visitors. Additional comments were made about
the poor facilities for visitors, which included the
lack of suﬃcient seating and the inability to get
light refreshments on the ward. In addition,
respondents viewed their inability to control the
temperature around their bed as a restriction.
While the general pattern emerging from the
questionnaire responses was for respondents to
be positive about the facilities on their ward, two
issues in particular received strong negative
ratings: restricted views of outside from the bed
and bedside entertainment (Table 4). In con-
trast, patients washroom facilities were gener-
ally rated very good. The trend overall was for
Table 4 Views on the ward facilities
the facilities to be rated as good or satisfactory
rather than very good. One respondent sugges-
ted that using more substantial dividing curtains
or repositioning the beds could overcome the
issue of lack of privacy. A similar point was also
made that the beds could be divided in a cor-
responding way to that used in open-plan oﬃce
complexes. There was general agreement that
the lack of activities for patients (such as a TV at
the end of the bed) tended to mean that patients
were more conscious of what was going on
around them and that this reduced the amount
of privacy patients had. TVs and headphones
oﬀered a distraction. There was consensus that
patients should have their own bedside TV and
entertainment communication
system,
which
was preferred to one central TV.
One area for improvement related to the views
outside the ward. Respondents reported that
having views helped them to relate to the out-
side world. One respondent suggested that hav-
ing a particular view outside the window could
greatly aﬀect one’s mood. Being able to see, and
preferably go outside was seen as very import-
ant. A further request was for the provision of
more windows within ward designs, not only in
terms of the views but also for ventilation.

Views on admission
All respondents were asked to rate the quality of
the facilities on the journey from the admissions
area to the ward. The majority of respondents
(50.3%) had walked onto the ward, while 29.2%
had been taken onto the ward on a trolley and
20.5% had used a wheelchair. Related responses
are presented in Table 5.
Rating of other facilities
Respondents identiﬁed a number of facilities
that catered for patients and their families across
the hospital, for example, the children’s play
area, the shopping areas and the restaurant and
cafe’s. Respondents were asked for their views
on each of these facilities (Table 6). The shop-
ping area received the most praise. The second
most popular facility was the cafe/restaurant.
In contrast, most of the other facilities were
generally rated as being at best satisfactory.

personal space; a welcoming atmosphere; an
environment that meets the needs of visitors;
good physical design in terms of usability,
accessibility and controllability; access to exter-
nal areas that promotes a sense of normality;
supportive environments for eﬀective commu-
nication between patients, staﬀand relatives;
and facilities for recreation and leisure. Patients
reported that knowing where they were at any
given point during their visit to the hospital was
very important. Many reported that they had
experienced confusion and diﬃculties with ori-
entation around the hospital on their ﬁrst visit
during the arrival and then the admittance phase
of their hospital experience. This ﬁnding sup-
ports studies that have reported on individuals
biological needs related to orientation, visual
perception and deﬁnition of territory.11,21,28,29
Patients perceptions of the environment once
they had been admitted to the ward were inﬂu-
enced by factors that aﬀected their normal life-
style functioning, such as their ability to eat and
sleep; feelings of security or insecurity and the
situation arising out of the amount of privacy
and dignity that the design of the ward allowed
them. Further factors suggested related to their
ability to control the environment and loss of
empowerment in simple day-to-day actions such
as switching lights on and oﬀas required by
changing conditions, adjusting the central heat-
ing, making a cup of tea, looking out through
the window and entertaining a visitor. These
ﬁndings support the results of previous studies
that stressed the importance of the healing
environment
in
patients
experience
and
recovery.9,14,17
Patients and the groups involved in the
research expressed the importance of being able
to have a sense of independence. This, for
example, can be facilitated by good design to
enable them to have enough space to move
around the ward area, to allow them privacy
with both medical staﬀand their family and
visitors. They also wanted to be able to view
everyday activities from all internal areas when
it was impossible to go outside. This hindrance
was captured in the photographs of inadequate
building design in which long corridors without
external access and with poorly positioned lifts
and stairs often made views and access to out-
side diﬃcult.
Supportive staff and service facilities
Patients placed importance upon the contribu-
tion made by supportive staﬀand other patients
to the experience of the hospital environment.
This was reﬂected, for example, in the number of
photographs that patients took of the nursing
staﬀto represent what they found to be good
about their environment. In some instances,
patients reported that they found it diﬃcult to
photograph what they disliked – for example,
the noise in the bay at night, which stopped
them from sleeping, and the lack of facilities
such as having TVs near their bedside and space,
chairs and basic catering provision that were
unavailable for their visitors comforts. These
ﬁndings support previous studies, which have
reported how functional environments that have
patient-focused, or supportive characteristics
assist patients in dealing with the stress of illness
and aid their recovery.20,30,31 Patients expressed
their desire to be supported and to be able to
have a sense of control of their actions through
the provision of well-designed facilities which
support social interaction and feelings of nor-
mality.
In identifying the preferences of stakeholders
regarding the type of facilities they wanted
the hospital and the wider NHS to provide, the
study found that respondents identiﬁed the
notion of a supportive environment and a basic
need for a sense of space encompassing private
and public territories. To be supportive, physical
space and social space needed to be ﬂexible and
negotiable. The key element was that the indi-
vidual should have ownership and control over
their space and others should not be able to
invade it without prior agreement. Social space
was considered to encompass communal areas
either within bays or between wards. It encom-
passed the provision of areas where patients
could eat, drink and interact with others to
maintain a sense of normality. The evidence
suggests that this need was not met by day
rooms, which were poorly used and perceived as
sparse, insular and empty places.
Patient-centred appraisal of built health-care
designs
The patients views, considerations and their
suggestions from each of the various areas of the
research provided a large number of itemized
criteria for design evaluation. Each indicator
element was developed from the ﬁndings by
extracting the principal considerations from the
range of views expressed from each area of
the qualitative and quantitative themes of the
research. In this way, qualitative factor and
content analysis allowed these considerations to
be broken down into 23 internal categories and
12 external categories. Thus each category, pre-
sented as separate indicator elements in Tables 7
and 8, was itself compiled from detailed subsets,
each of which provided greater detail to reﬂect
the range of considerations put forward by
patients. For example, as shown in Table 7, the
entrances and reception areas indicator set
comprised 18 elements. The patients privacy
and dignity subset comprised nine elements,
catering 11 elements and accessibility eight.
Tables 7 and 8 present the separate internal
and external environment design appraisal indi-
cator sets. They comprise individual elements by

which designs can be appraised from the patients

mised hearing, vision and bodily functions, and
patient characteristics, whether neonates, chil-

health-care designs on the basis of these indica-

awarded on the basis of contributory potential to
patient health status and sympathies.
The project commissioners, design team and
patients from representative clinical pathways
should discuss and agree upon the speciﬁc indi-

apply during the design planning and develop-
ment brieﬁng stages. As an appraisal tool, the
indicators allow ﬂexibility in its application
allowing selected elements and health status
categories to be applied with respect to patient

good patient focussed design should score over
90% of the aggregate score for the agreed indi-
cator elements and health status categories.
Conclusion
This paper explored patients perceptions and
their attitudes to hospital environments and to
the factors that contributed to their experience.
Patients were found to have full understandings
of the range of factors that aﬀected them,
especially bearing in mind their existing health
status, independent of the speciﬁc health con-
dition that led to their hospitalization. Patients
across the four departments of the case study
hospital provided an extensive range of health
inﬂuencing considerations. Principal indicator
sets were extracted to form internal and external
indicator sets, each with individual element by
which to evaluate a design. Such an approach
provides for an increased focus around the
interest of the patient and allows their normal
health status to be taken into account during the
design process and planning stages. By this the
design of hospitals internal and external areas,
including transitional spaces for access and
patients ﬂows, should provide for sustainable
supportive environments, which minimize anxi-
ety and promote healing through the creation of
an overall inviting, calming and engaging eﬀect.

10.3992/jgb.3.1.74,Sustainable lighting for healthcare facilities: More than just lumens per watt,2008,,"INTRODUCTION
Sustainability is, as the name implies, a movement to ensure long-term, efﬁcient utilization of resources. Sustainability does not imply that resources should be restricted nor that resource utilization should be subsidized. Bill 
McDonough (McDonough and Braungart 2002) has described sustainability in terms of the three E’s: environment, 
equity, and economy. In the last quarter century the lighting industry has dramatically improved the energy efﬁ
 ciency 
(environment “E”) and life-cycle cost of lighting (economy “E”). Much less attention has been given to the equity “E.” 
Lighting standards are still set primarily in terms of illuminances (lumens per square meter) and lumens per watt, 
both of which are based upon the implicit assumption that the value of lighting can be characterized by the lumen. 
The lumen is, however, unrelated to other non-visual effects of light, such as the circadian system, and is only indi-
rectly related to our perceptual system. In particular, our current architectural practices do not adequately support the 
most fragile segments of the population. And no matter how much energy is conserved or how much value engineer-
ing is applied, we are not designing or implementing sustainable lighting because we are not supporting many of the 
people in our built environments. In fact, the role of lighting as it affects human perceptual and circadian functions 
is almost completely ignored in standards. Arguably, the failure to consider these two human domain functions can 
be ignored in many modern applications because of the inherent ﬂexibility and robustness of the human species. One 
segment of construction where the equity “E” should always be more seriously considered, however, is healthcare applications. These applications contain our most fragile humans, and lighting has been shown, for example, to demonstrably affect the lives of seniors and premature infants. But there are no standards to assist architects and engineers in 
supporting the well-being of these fragile people. To illustrate this assertion, this article focuses on sustainable lighting 
for healthcare applications where good lighting in all three human domains, visual, perceptual, and circadian, can be 
best documented.
BACKGROUND
Bill McDonough (McDonough and Braungart 
2002) has described sustainability in terms of the 
three E’s: environment, equity, and economy (Fig-
ure 1). The environment “E” is most often associ-
ated with the sustainability movement in lighting. 
Nearly every discussion of sustainable lighting is 
concerned, often only concerned, with energy ef-
ﬁciency. Certainly energy efﬁciency is essential for 
sustainability. But it is equally important that sustainable lighting is cost effective and it should serve 
the needs of building occupants. 
Sustainability should support human endeavors, 
not waste our natural resources, and should be profitable. For “cradle to cradle” sustainability all three 
E’s must be addressed. In the last quarter century 
the lighting industry has dramatically improved 
the energy efﬁciency and life-cycle cost of lighting. 
Much less attention has been given to the equity “E” 
of the sustainability triangle illustrated in Figure 1. 
Lighting standards are still set primarily in terms of 
illuminances (lumens per square meter) and lumens 
per watt, both of which are based upon the implicit 
assumption that the value of lighting can be characterized by the lumen. However, the lumen is derived 
from a very narrow set of experimental conditions 
that are only relevant to simple visual functions, but 
does not characterize all of the visual responses important to modern built environments (e.g., apparent 
brightness). Moreover, the lumen is only indirectly 
related to providing perceptual information about 
the environment (e.g., linear perspective) and it is, 
by deﬁnition, unrelated to the non-visual, circadian 
effects of lighting that help maintain entrainment of 
our many biological functions to local time. Boyce 
and Rea (2001) have conceptualized three domains 
that light can affect people. These are illustrated in 
Figure 2. Again, the lumen is relevant to only one of 
these three domains, which is the visual system.
LIGHT ISN’T JUST FOR VISION ANYMORE
Light is formally defined as optical radiation be-
tween 380 and 780 nm that provides visual sensation in humans (CIE 1978). The human eye has 
photoreceptors that convert radiant energy into neural signals for processing by the brain, a phenomenon called phototransduction. Until recently, four 
types of photoreceptors had been identified: rods 
and short, middle, and long wavelength cones (Rea 
2000). Rods allow us to see at night and cones allow 
us to see during the day, discriminate details, and see 
colors. The neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of 
the human visual system is largely understood and 
all lighting technologies, standards, measurement 
devices and applications have been based solely on 
that understanding (Rea 2000). Given very recent 
developments in science, however, it is important to 
embrace the fact that light is not just for vision any-
more. In the past few decades much work has been 
done to understand the non-visual effects of light on 
human health and well-being (Rea et al. 2002). 
Light entering the human eye is transmitted to 
several other parts in the brain than those project-
ing to the visual centers. In 2002, the intrinsically 
photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGCs), a 
novel photoreceptor type in the retina, was discovered (Berson et al. 2002). The ipRGCs are central 
to an important “non-visual” response to light by 
the retina, most notably the regulation of circadian 
rhythms. The world rotates around its axis and, as 
a result, all creatures exposed to daylight on earth 
experience 24-hour cycles of light and dark. Biological rhythms are self-sustaining oscillations with a 
set of species-speciﬁc characteristics, including amplitude, phase, and period (Moore-Ede et al. 1982). 
Living organisms have adapted to this daily rotation 
of the earth by developing biological rhythms that 
repeat at approximately 24 hours. These are called 
circadian rhythms (Latin: circa, about; dies, day). 
FIGURE 2. Human performance, 
health, and well-being is inﬂuenced by 
at least three systems: visual, circadian, 
and perceptual. Circadian rhythms are generated endogenously 
(internal to the body) and are constantly aligned 
with the environment by zeitgebers (time givers), 
factors exogenous or external to the body. In mammals, circadian rhythms are regulated by an internal 
biological clock (pacemaker) located in the supra-
chiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus of 
the brain (Moore-Ede et al. 1982). The SCN is a 
self-sustaining oscillator that maintains its daily ac-
tivities for weeks when isolated and cultured. The 
SCN in humans has a natural period that is slightly 
greater than 24 hours and environmental cues can 
reset and synchronize the SCN daily, ensuring that 
the organism’s behavioral and physiological rhythms 
are in synchrony with the daily rhythms in its environment. The light/dark cycle is the main synchronizer of the SCN to the solar day (Klein et al. 1991) 
and reaches the SCN via the retinohypothalamic 
tract (RHT). Although the circadian system shares 
receptors and neurons in the retina with the visual 
system, the retinal ganglion cells exiting the eye for 
the visual centers are different than those exiting the 
eye for the circadian system. Light as well as dark 
play an important role in regulating our circadian 
rhythms, and the timing of light/dark cycles are 
profoundly important for many of our behaviors as 
well as our well-being.
Light can have both an acute and a phase-shift-
ing effect on the internal clock. Acute effects are 
seen shortly after light exposure. For example, it 
takes about ﬁve to ten minutes for light to suppress 
the production of nocturnal melatonin, a hormone 
produced at night and under condition of darkness 
(McIntyre et al. 1989). Acute effects also disappear 
soon after a light stimulus is removed; after about 
30 to 45 minutes in the dark, nocturnal melatonin 
returns to a normal level. Phase shifting effects are 
seen a few hours or days after light exposure. Light 
applied during the early part of the night will delay 
the clock (for example, bed and waking times will 
occur later than in the previous cycle) and light applied very late at night or in the early morning will 
advance the clock (bed and waking times will occur 
earlier than in the previous cycle). If light is applied 
before minimum core body temperature, it will 
delay the clock while light applied after minimum 
core body temperature will advance the clock. Mini-
mum core body temperature typically occurs about 
1½ to 2 hours before one wakes up naturally (i.e., 
without an alarm clock) (Jewett et al. 1997). 
In addition to impacting our circadian system, 
light reveals the many intersecting spatial planes that 
make up the environment (Paulus et al. 1984). Architectural features can be used to provide information about the environment and therefore improve 
navigation in the space (Gibson 1966). Light reveals 
visual information by providing a spatial reference 
for self-position and location of obstacles within a 
person’s surroundings. For example, removal of 
visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to 
result in increased body sway (Paulus et al. 1984; 
Turano et al. 1994). Therefore, lighting schemes 
that reveal or enhance architectural features should 
be used to aid navigation and orientation in the built 
environment.
LIGHTING CHARACTERISTICS 
AFFECTING THE VISUAL AND 
CIRCADIAN SYSTEMS
Light can be decomposed in ﬁ
 ve characteristic di-
mensions: quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing, 
and duration (Rea et al. 2002). These light characteristics affect the circadian system very differently 
than they affect the visual and perceptual systems. 
In brief, more light is needed to impact the circadian 
system than to stimulate the visual system. Young 
people can read a book under moonlight but no 
studies to date have been able to demonstrate that 
moonlight suppresses nocturnal melatonin production or shifts circadian phase. For reading, the day-
time (photopic) visual response is maximally sensitive to light at 555 nm (yellow-green light), while 
the circadian system is a “blue-sky detector,” maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 450 nm. The visual system has a very fast response time. The visual 
system can fully process light pulses as short as 80 
milliseconds. The circadian system is very slow to 
respond requiring several minutes to fully integrate 
light falling on the retina. Thus the circadian system seems to be completely blind to brief but very 
bright lightning ﬂashes at night. Perhaps the largest 
difference between the visual and circadian systems 
is associated with the time that light is registered 
on the retina. The visual system responds nearly 
the same any time of the day or night. However, as 
already mentioned, the internal clock can be reset 
forward (phase advance) or backward (phase delay) 
depending on the timing of light exposure. Finally, 
it should be added that the sensitivity of the circa-
dian system to light appears to change depending 
on previous light exposures. For example, an ofﬁce worker who stayed in a dim room all day long will 
suppress more melatonin when exposed to a given 
light at night than would a farmer, who had experienced very high outdoor light levels during the day. 
The circadian system seems to be more concerned 
with contrasting (night versus day) than absolute 
light levels (Herbert et al. 2002). 
HOW LIGHT IMPACTS OUR HEALTH 
AND WELL-BEING
The effects of light on the circadian system are not 
trivial and should always be taken into consideration 
when designing lighting in a space. Upsetting the 
daily pattern of circadian light and dark affects performance and well-being, as well as, it seems, our 
basic health. The therapeutic value of circadian light 
(and dark) on fringe populations has been demonstrated in laboratory and ﬁ
 eld studies. Light with the appropriate characteristics can reduce symptoms 
of seasonal affective disorder (Levitt et al. 2002), 
increase sleep efficiency of older adults including 
those with Alzheimer’s disease (van Someren et al. 
1997; Figueiro et al. 2002; Figueiro and Rea 2005), 
improve circadian entrainment of premature infants 
(Rivkees et al. 2004), and increase alertness and 
well-being of night-shift workers (Badia et al. 1991, 
Cajochen et al. 2000, Figueiro et al. 2001, Cajochen 
et al. 2005, Figueiro et al. 2007). It has even been 
suggested that some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease may be linked to the disruption of the 
normal circadian light/dark pattern. The impact 
of light on the general population is less clear. It is 
hypothesized that some disorders, including cancer 
and heart disease, may be a result of lack of entrainment, or synchronization, between the timing of 
one’s internal clock and the day/night pattern, much 
like jet-lag after travel across multiple time zones.
EQUITY FOR OLDER ADULTS 
IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES 
AND NURSING HOMES
After age 40, changes to the aging eye become more 
noticeable as visual capabilities decrease. The inability to focus on objects at close distances is noticed 
in particular after age 45; this is called presbyopia. 
As one grows older, less light reaches the back of the 
eyes because the pupil gets smaller and the crystal-
line lens inside the eye becomes thicker, absorbing 
more light. A 60-year-old receives about 1/3 of as 
much light at the retina as a 20-year-old. The lens 
also begins to scatter more light as one ages, add-
ing a “luminous veil” over images on the retina, 
which reduces the distinctness (or contrast) of ob-
jects and the vividness of colors. After age 60 to 65 
years, chances of having age-related eye diseases are 
greater. Common age-related problems are cataract, 
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and 
glaucoma. Cataracts are dark, cloudy, or opaque 
areas in parts or all of the crystalline lens. Macular 
degeneration refers to neural damage to central vi-
sion. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when blood vessels 
feeding the retina are damaged and regions of visual 
ﬁeld are lost. Glaucoma is a result of too much ﬂuid pressure inside the eye, which cuts off blood ﬂow 
and, thus, nutrition to the retina and ultimately the 
optic nerve. As one ages, changes to the circadian system are 
also more noticeable and may lead to sleep disturbances. Surveys indicate that 40 to 70 percent of 
the oldest members of the population (over 65 years 
old) suffer from chronic sleep disturbances (Van So-
meren 2000). In general, older adults tend to go to 
bed earlier in the evening and wake earlier in the 
morning than younger adults. Frequent nocturnal 
awakenings, difficulty falling asleep, and an increased number of naps during the day are also more 
common in the oldest adults. Sleep disturbances are 
associated with decreased physical health, including 
increased cardiovascular problems, disruption of en-
docrine functions, and decline of immune functions 
(Van Cauter et al. 1998).
Many physiological changes are implicated in the 
circadian rhythm disturbances found in older adults. 
Studies have shown that the SCN may become 
less responsive as we age. Studies have also demonstrated that changes in the amplitude and timing of 
melatonin and core body temperature rhythms may 
occur in older adults. Also, the ﬁrst stage of photo-
transduction (when light signals are converted into 
neural signals) is negatively affected; older adults 
not only have reduced optical transmission at short 
wavelengths, which is maximally effective for the cir-
cadian system, but they also lead a more sedentary 
indoor lifestyle, with less access to bright light during the day. In fact, research has demonstrated that 
middle-aged adults are exposed to approximately 58 
minutes of light above 1000 lux at the eye per day 
(Espiratu et al. 1994), while older adults in assisted 
living facilities were exposed to light above 1000 lux 
at the eye for only 35 minutes a day (Sanchez et al. 
1993). Moreover, adults in nursing homes see as little 
as 2 minutes of light a day above 2000 lux at the eye 
(Ancoli-Israel et al. 1989). 
Previous research demonstrated that light can 
be used as a non-pharmacological tool to help older 
adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), sleep more efﬁciently. Light in the evening can 
delay the circadian clock and help older adults sleep 
better at night and be more awake during the day 
(Murphy and Campbell 1996). Other studies have 
shown that exposure to bright white light improved 
sleep efﬁciency of institutionalized older adults (Sat-
lin et al. 1992; Okawa et al. 1993; Mishima et al. 
1994; Fetveit et al. 2003). One study demonstrated 
that evening exposure to 30 lx at the eye of blue light 
from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) peaking at 470 
nm for two hours consolidated rest/activity rhythms 
and increased sleep efﬁciency of older adults with 
sleep complaints (Figueiro and Rea 2005). Exposure 
to bright light (at least 2500 lx and as high as 8000 
lx) for at least one hour in the morning for a period of 
at least two weeks consolidated sleep of AD patients. 
Greater sleep efﬁciency at night decreased sleep during daytime hours and, in some cases, reduced agitation behavior (Ancoli-Israel et al. 2000; Koyama et 
al. 1999; Lyketsos et al. 1999; Mishima et al. 1998; 
Lovell et al. 1995; Mishima et al. 1994). Unattended 
exposure to bright white light (1136 lux average at 
the eye) during the entire day improved rest-activity 
of AD patients (van Someren et al. 1997). Evening 
exposure to bright white light (1500 to 2000 lx) for 
two hours decreased nocturnal activity and severity 
of evening agitation (sundowning) of AD patients 
(Satlin et al. 1992). Finally, evening exposure to 30 
lx at the eye of blue light from LEDs peaking at 470 
nm for two hours consolidated rest/activity rhythms 
and increased sleep efﬁciency of persons with AD 
(Figueiro et al. 2002 and Figueiro and Rea 2005). 
More recently, Sloane et al. showed that exposure to 
high intensity light all day or during morning hours 
only increased nighttime sleep in subjects with se-
vere and very severe dementia. They also showed 
that morning light produced a mean phase advance 
of 29 minutes; that is, subjects went to bed earlier 
than prior to the lighting intervention. 
The visual system also plays an important role in 
postural control and stability. More importantly, vi-
sual information is integrated with input from the 
vestibular and somatosensory systems, which are 
linked to balance control. Any changes that occur to 
any of these systems will affect the other systems’ ca-
pabilities of maintaining balance (Lord et al. 1991). 
In fact, studies have demonstrated that removal of 
visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to 
result in increased body sway. Recently, Figueiro 
and colleagues showed that nightlights that provide 
horizontal and vertical perceptual cues are well ac-
cepted by caregivers and, more importantly, can 
help increase postural stability when older adults 
are transitioning from sitting to a standing position 
(Figueiro et al. 2007). 
USING LIGHTING TO PROMOTE EQUITY 
IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND 
NURSING HOMES
Although not everything is known about the effects 
of light on health and well-being, it seems reasonable with the information available today to provide 
a 24-hour lighting scheme that maintains circadian 
entrainment as much as possible while promoting 
good visibility during waking hours and safe navigation at night. Following this logic, lighting in as-
sisted living facilities and nursing homes should provide: high circadian light stimulation during the day 
and low circadian stimulation at night; good visual 
performance (e.g., reading) during waking hours; 
and low-level nightlights that enable safe movement 
through the space and minimize sleep disruption. 
Guidelines for lighting for the aging 
circadian system
Proposed is a dual lighting scheme that maximizes 
circadian stimulation during the day and minimizes 
it at night, while maintaining good visibility at any 
time (Figueiro 2008, in press). The evidence suggests that high circadian stimulation during daytime 
waking hours can probably be achieved by about 
400 lx at the cornea of a 6500 K (cool-white) light 
source. During evening waking hours, the lighting 
system should provide no more than 100 lx at the 
cornea from a white light with low energy in the 
short-wavelength region of the spectrum. Relatively 
dim ambient evening light can be provided by light 
sources such as a 2700 K (warm-white) compact ﬂ
 u-
orescent lamp (CFL). The dual lighting system pro-
vides older people with a day/night circadian light 
ratio of about 16:1. 
High circadian stimulation during the day and 
low circadian stimulation during the evening can be 
achieved using a combination of daylight and electric light sources. Daylight can certainly be an effective light source for regulating the circadian system. 
Outdoor lighting has the ideal quantity, spectrum, 
distribution, timing, and duration, but it should not 
be assumed that daylight in buildings will always 
provide people with a suitable circadian light pat-
tern. Again, a quantitative analysis of daylight in the 
space should be carefully made because the amount 
of daylight varies considerably throughout a build-
ing. Daylight levels in a room drop very quickly 
as the distance from the window increases; day-
light levels are quite low three to four meters away 
from a window, even on a sunny day (Bullough et 
al. 1996). It should also be noted that if sunlight 
from the window penetrates the room, discomfort 
glare may cause occupants to draw blinds or shades, 
eliminating daylight entirely from the space. Since 
it cannot be assumed that daylight in buildings is 
always going to be a solution for circadian entrainment, electric light must always be considered.
In order to select the most efﬁcacious light source 
for the circadian system, an assessment of the relative circadian effectiveness of different spectral 
power distributions (SPDs) emitted by common 
electric light sources was performed using the model 
of human circadian phototransduction developed by 
Rea and colleagues (Rea et al. 2005). This model 
considers the fact that the circadian system is maximally sensitive to blue light, so light sources that 
have more short wavelength content (i.e., look more 
bluish-white) are more effective in activating the circadian system for the same amount of used watts. 
Table 1 shows the photopic lumens per watt (lm/W) 
and circadian stimulus per watt (CS/W) for a selection of commercially available light sources. 
The relatively dim evening lighting scheme is 
entirely consistent with current lighting recommendations and practice and, although the light levels 
recommended for daytime applications are relatively 
high compared to current practice, they are not difﬁcult to achieve with contemporary, high-efﬁcacy, 
ﬂuorescent lighting systems, particularly if controls 
are incorporated into the design. The designer should 
also consider using the dual lighting scheme in com-
mon areas where residents are more likely to spend 
their waking hours. This may vary with the application. For example, in a single room assisted living 
setting, the dual lighting scheme needs to be implemented in the room and in a common area, such as 
the dining room. In nursing homes, the dual light-
ing scheme can be implemented in day rooms and 
dining rooms. If power density requirements are still 
an issue, however, local supplementary lights from 
blue LEDs can be integrated into the design. Based 
on the author’s previous experience, compliance by 
older adults to a light treatment given by a supplementary lighting system is not trivial. However, in 
cases where compliance is not an issue, such as when 
the treatment is applied to healthy older adults liv-
ing at home or in assisted living, ambient light levels 
can be reduced to 80–100 lux at the cornea (which is 
about 300 lux on the horizontal surfaces) of a neutral 
light source (3000 K–4100 K lamp) and the use of

body radiator of 2856 K at 100 lux at the eye. In this 
way, values for both lm/W and CS/W become equal for 
a common incandescent light source. Adapted from

be used for at least 2 hrs in the morning. Table 1 pro-
vides quantitative guidance on the amount of light 
needed to match the circadian effectiveness of many 
light sources, including blue LEDs.
Guidelines for lighting for the aging 
visual system
Of course, good visual conditions cannot be ignored 
in any application, but it is important particularly 
when designing lighting for older adults. The light 
levels recommended for the circadian system should 
be sufﬁcient for older adults to perform daily visual 
tasks. In spaces where the high circadian stimulation 
cannot be used, ambient light levels for the aging 
visual system should be 300 lux on the horizontal 
surfaces (80–100 lux at the cornea) of a neutral light 
source (i.e., 3000 K–4100 K lamp). More localized 
light will be needed to perform tasks that require 
seeing fine details (e.g., sewing, reading prescription bottle labels, chopping vegetables). Architects 
and speciﬁers should still provide lighting that gives 
high, glare-free illumination on the task with no di-
rect or reﬂected view of the light source, soft shadows 
throughout the space, balanced illuminance levels, 
and light sources that provide good color rendering. 
Some other lighting principles for the aging visual 
system that can help architects, speciﬁers, builders, 
facility managers, and homeowners (Figueiro, 2001) 
light interior spaces include: 
• More light on task areas—use concentrated light 
to increase illuminance levels on the task. As 
much as 10 times more light will be required to 
see ﬁne details (e.g., reading small points) or low-
contrast objects (e.g., black thread on blue cloth) 
than is required to see most architectural structures (e.g., doors, cabinets, furniture). Increase 
light level in areas where visual tasks are per-
formed by placing adjustable light ﬁxtures close 
to the task, or by selecting lamps with more lumens (look for lumen rating on the package, not 
wattage; be careful not to exceed the lamp ﬁxture 
wattage). Fluorescent lamps are usually a good 
option because they provide more lumens per 
watt than incandescent lamps, and they last 10 
times longer than common incandescent lamps; 
they are available with excellent color, plenty of 
light, no buzz or ﬂicker; they are cooler to touch, 
and they can be dimmed. Increase ambient light 
levels by keeping surface ﬁnishes light in color. 
Light-colored walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings will help 
minimize shadows and increase overall light lev-

light source itself should always be hidden from direct view. (Photograph by Michael Kalla.)
els in the living environment. Place light ﬁxtures 
where visibility is important, such as below the 
kitchen countertop, over the kitchen sink, in the 
shower, and in closet and laundry spaces.
• Less glare—Although more light is required 
for the older eye to see, care should be taken 
to avoid glare. Glare is experienced when light 
sources or bright reﬂections in the ﬁeld of view 
impair vision, or are uncomfortable. Very bright 
lights should not be placed against dark ceilings. 
The light source itself should be hidden with a 
shade, bafﬂes, non-shiny louvers, or a shielding 
board. If a bare lamp is unavoidable (e.g., fan 
lights), it should be frosted to diffuse the light. 
In this same vein, clear glass light ﬁxtures should 
also be avoided. The use of shiny ﬂoor ﬁnishes 
and polished surfaces should also be minimized 
to reduce reﬂection from light sources. 
• Balanced light levels—Due to optical and per-
haps neural changes to the eye, older adults 
cannot adapt to dim lighting conditions as well 
as younger people. As a result, illuminance 
levels in transitional spaces, such as hallways 
and entrance foyers, should be similar to those 
of the adjacent spaces. The ambient light levels 
in adjacent spaces should be balanced to be 
approximately the same. Multiple switches or 
dimmers to create intermediate light levels in 
transitional spaces that lead from bright, outdoor 
areas, to dim, indoor spaces should be chosen. 
Transitional spaces should be dimmer at night 
and brighter during the day.
• Enhanced colors—Color discrimination is poorer 
for older adults because of scattered light in the 
eye. The aged lens also absorbs relatively more 
short wavelength (blue) light, so it is particularly 
difﬁcult to discriminate between, for example, 
dark purple and maroon. Use lamps with high 
lumens and good color rendering properties. A 
more extensive discussion on color properties of 
the light source is below. 
• Improved contrast—Because contrast sensitivity 
is reduced with age, the visibility of important 
objects, such as stair edges, curbs, ramps, or 
doorways, can be greatly improved by increasing 
their contrast with paint or similar techniques. 
FIGURE 4. Shielding boards or lenses should be used to hide a direct view of the light source. (Photograph by Michael 
Kalla.)
Contrasting colors to mark edges, such as door-
frames, baseboards, or steps should be used.
Designing a lighting installation that meets the 
needs of the aging eye involves selecting the proper 
light source, lighting ﬁ
 xture, and lighting control, 
as well as determining the best location for the 
equipment in the room. The following tips help 
in the selection and proper installation of lighting 
equipment:
• For general illumination, use compact ﬂ
 uores-
cent lamps with approximately 1/3 the wattage 
of a common incandescent lamp to produce the 
same amount of light. 
• To highlight certain areas (e.g., above kitchen 
sink) or objects (e.g., pictures on the wall), use a 
halogen parabolic aluminized reﬂector (PAR) in-
candescent lamp to concentrate the illumination. 
• Avoid clear glass light ﬁxtures and light bulbs; 
these create glare.
• Select a semi-secular or matte ﬁ
 nish to prevent 
glare from the reﬂ
 ection of the light bulb for 
light ﬁxtures with a visible reﬂector.
• Select a deep-recessed downright (cutoff angle 
between 40( and 50( from horizontal) so the 
light source is hidden from normal sight lines.
• Avoid placing recessed or ceiling mounted lu-
minaires on dark ceilings; they may appear too 
bright and cause glare.
• Place light ﬁxtures located above ﬁxed working 
areas slightly to the side and in front of the position where a person would stand to see the task.
• Use wet location-rated light ﬁxtures in shower/
bath areas. (Figure 5).
• Select a matte countertop vanity with light colors that reﬂect light to the underside of the 
chin. To avoid harsh facial shadows, avoid using 
recessed downlights to light the bathroom vanity 
countertop (Figure 5). 
Guidelines for lighting for the aging 
perceptual system
Just as important, nightlights that both reduce the 
risk of falls and help to maintain sleep should be 
used. Proposed nightlights with motion-sensor control are shown in Figure 6. The nightlights should

light the vanity countertop should never be used; lighting from the sides of the mirror is much better for grooming.

provide dim illumination to the local environment 
(1 to 5 lux at the cornea), but they also provide enhanced spatial perceptual information about the 
surroundings. Nightlights accent the rectilinear architectural features in the room, highlighting essential vertical and horizontal information people need 
to promote postural stability while navigating in an 
otherwise dim environment. Since the nightlights 
are only on when motion is detected, they do not re-
quire the occupant to grope blindly for a light switch 
that, when found, would then activate a bright, ambient lighting system. They are on only when a per-
son needs to move through the space at night.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Table 2 summarizes lighting principles for older 
adults that should meet the needs of their visual, 
circadian, and perceptual systems. Two lighting

the occupant.
schemes are proposed, and the more appropriate 
solution will depend on the needs of the occupant. 
Although lighting scheme 1 will have higher initial 
and operating costs, it is the recommended solution 
for older adults who cannot easily or are unwilling 
to change their behavior. The architect and speciﬁer should keep in mind that to save expense lighting 
scheme 1 can be installed in just a few highly used 
spaces rather than throughout the entire facility. 
Lighting scheme 2 should be used when compliance 
by older people is unlikely to occur and where ceil-
ing renovations cannot be practically implemented. 
EQUITY FOR CAREGIVERS 
IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES
Healthcare facilities operate 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week, and, therefore, the design criteria must 
also take into account the needs of health care professionals, both day and night. The lighting prin-
ciples for the visual system discussed above are also 
applicable for dayshift and nightshift workers, but 
their needs are not as acute. Lighting that is designed 
for the aging eye is good lighting for any age group! 
When it comes to circadian lighting, dayshift workers are more likely to have the opportunity to receive 
sufﬁcient circadian light during their waking hours 
than more sedentary older adults. Nevertheless, this 
is not always the case so it is important that dayshift 
workers receive high circadian light stimulation 
during the day and low circadian light stimulation 
during evening hours at home to maintain circa-
dian entrainment. Sufﬁcient daylight from windows 
and skylights during working hours combined with 
daylight exposure outside the workplace can provide 
sufﬁcient circadian light stimulation. Low circadian 
light during the evening and night is equally important. By strategically adopting changes in light spectrum and level at work and at home, good circadian 
light stimulation as well as good visual conditions 
can be created throughout the day and night.
Designing for the well-being of nightshift work-
ers, however, is much more complicated. Nightshift 
workers are almost always required to be awake when 
their internal clocks are telling them to be asleep and 
asleep when their internal clocks are telling them to 
be awake. As a result, nightshift workers often feel 
very sleepy while at work and do not have good sleep 
quality during the day. Generally, nightshift workers

are not entrained to the night shift because they are 
not presented with high circadian light stimulation 
during the night and low circadian light stimulation 
during the day. Rather, they are typically exposed 
to rather “ﬂ
 at” or aperiodic light exposures. Figure 
7a illustrates one of these ﬂ
 at and aperiodic light exposures for one nightshift worker. Figure 7b shows a 
much more consolidated, light-during-the-day and 
dark-during-the-night pattern for a dayshift worker. 
This ﬂ
 at and aperiodic light proﬁ
 le is not well suit-
able for circadian entrainment and, due to this 
poor entrainment, their performance, health, and 
well-being can become compromised. For example, 
nightshift women are signiﬁcantly more susceptible 
to breast cancer than population matched dayshift 
women.
The most appropriate lighting scheme for night-
shift workers is still debated, mostly because of 
the possible negative impact of working at a time 
when our body is telling us to be asleep. In the late 
1980s, Stevens put forward the melatonin hypothesis wherein high incidence of breast cancer in industrialized society was related to exposure to too 
much light at night, which, in turn, suppressed the 
production of nocturnal melatonin (Stevens 1987). 
Stevens’s hypothesis stimulated various lines of re-
search, from animal models to epidemiological 
studies. Blask and colleagues were among the ﬁrst 
to use an animal model to investigate the effects of 
melatonin on certain types of tumor growth (Blask 
et al. 1999; Blask et al. 2005). Their studies clearly 
showed a relationship between nighttime light ex-
posure, melatonin suppression, and growth rate of 
certain types of cancer. Epidemiological studies in 
humans suggest a high cancer risk associated with 
rotating shift workers (Schernhammer et al. 2001). 
Based on these ﬁndings, nightshift workers are ex-
posed to light at night, which would then suppress 
melatonin, depriving nightshift workers from pro-
tection against cancer. It is important to note that 
a direct link between light at night, melatonin sup-
pression, and cancer initiation has never been established in humans. What remains to be determined is 
whether the higher cancer risk is the result of light at 
night, or is the result of circadian disruption caused 
by a lack of a regular 24-hour, cyclic light exposure

pattern like that shown in Figure 7a. Because it is 
still unknown what the most appropriate lighting 
scheme for the circadian system of nightshift workers is, a lighting recommendation for nightshift 
workers will not be discussed here.
USING LIGHTING TO PROMOTE 
EQUITY FOR CAREGIVERS 
IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES
The lighting principles for older adults discussed 
herein are applicable to dayshift workers working in 
healthcare facilities. It is important that lighting systems for healthcare facilities promote high circadian 
stimulation of workers during the day without impacting the circadian systems of nightshift workers, 
so the most appropriate alternative is to add a layer 
of blue light to the space provided by local lighting. 
This local lighting can be used by dayshift workers 
only until more is known about the most appropriate lighting for nightshift workers. When designing 
lighting for caregivers in healthcare environments, it 
is important to keep in mind that the lighting systems in these facilities are used throughout the 24-
hour day/night and have to meet the needs of both 
dayshift and nightshift workers—therefore, ﬂexibility is imperative. 
Guidelines for lighting for dayshift workers’ 
circadian system
Unlike older adults who tend to stay indoors most of 
their waking hours, dayshift workers are more likely 
to be exposed to high circadian stimulation from 
outdoor lighting during their waking hours. Nevertheless, it is still important to ensure that they are 
receiving sufﬁcient circadian stimulation during the 
daytime hours while at work, especially in winter 
months when daylight periods are reduced. 
Because ﬂexibility is needed and compliance to 
lighting intervention may not be an issue for day-
shift workers, it may be more cost effective to add 
a layer of blue light to the space to promote circa-
dian entrainment of dayshift workers. For example, 
a local lighting system providing 30 lux of blue light 
(λmax = 470 nm) at the cornea can be effective for 
the circadian system (Figures 8a and 8b). Well-
designed daylight that penetrates the space without 
glare should always be considered in the healthcare 
environment to help dayshift workers’ exposure to 
morning light. 
Guidelines for lighting for dayshift 
(and nightshift) workers’ visual systems
Studies conducted by the Lighting Research Center 
showed that the recommended light levels of 500 lux 
on the work plane can be reduced by 20% without 
being noticed by users. Therefore, overall ambient 
light levels can be reduced and task lights should be 
used to increase light levels in critical areas, such as 
reading and writing areas, examination rooms, and 
emergency rooms. 
Light sources used in the healthcare environ-
ment should allow for good color perception. Color 
perception is the result of the neural characteristics of the observer’s visual system, the SPD of the

solution for healthcare applications.
light source, and, if the light source serves as an illuminant, the spectral reﬂectance of the object. in 
order to guarantee good color perception, Rea et 
al. (2004) and Figueiro et al. (2006b) propose that 
light sources have a minimum color rendering index 
(CRI) value of 80, a minimum full spectrum color 
index (FSCI) value of 55, and a gamut area index 
(GAI) value between 65 and 100. While it is not 
within the scope of this article to present a comprehensive discussion of color perception, for more 
information see Rea et al. (2004). In brief, CRI is 
the conventional measure of light source color rendering, but has been shown in a number of studies 
to be inadequate as the sole measure of adequacy of 
a light source for providing color information. To 
complement CRI, FSCI and GAI were developed to 
help ensure good color rendering by a light source. 
FSCI uses an imaginary equal energy spectrum with 
the same radiant power across the entire visible spec-
trum as a reference source and scales all other light 
sources in terms of their ability to provide radiant 
power throughout the spectrum. GAI is a measure

for various commercial light sources. 
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 
Table 4 summarizes the lighting principles for 
dayshift workers in healthcare applications. The 
proposed lighting scheme should suffice the needs 
of daytime workers’ visual, circadian, and perceptual systems. The lighting principles for the visual 
and perceptual systems are applicable to nightshift 
workers, but the lighting scheme for the nightshift 
circadian system is still unknown and was not dis-
cussed here.
CONCLUSIONS
As Bill McDonough stated in his book and as exempliﬁed in this article, sustainable lighting should be 
designed with more than illuminance (lumens per 
area) and lumens per watt in mind. Public awareness 
about how lighting can make important contributions to the quality of life of those working and liv-
ing in healthcare facilities needs to be built so that 
architects and speciﬁers can respond. Without that 
demand, architects and speciﬁers will only rely on 
the existing, but outdated and inadequate, lighting 
codes and standards. As exempliﬁed in this article, 
lighting that is designed with the visual, circadian, 
and perceptual systems in mind can help the most 
fragile humans improve their quality of sleep, reduce

unfortunate that these lighting design principles are 
not being widely practiced.
As already noted, well-intentioned energy codes 
are to blame because they are based upon the implicit, but erroneous, notion that sustainability deals 
with only the efﬁciency “E.” Initial attempts to include design issues related to the circadian system 
have been made in documents such as the Green 
Guide for Healthcare, but these concepts have not 
been implemented in the design of healthcare environments. It is time for the public to demand that 
architects and speciﬁers pay more attention to the 
equity “E” by bringing research into practice. In that 
way lighting will meet the needs of all three human 
domains: visual, perceptual, and circadian. It is 
hoped that the concepts and tips presented in this 
article can help transform the basis for our lighted 
environments. Remember, all of us will become older 
and one day we too might be condemned to an unsustainable lighted environment.

Aim. This paper reports a systematic review to determine the effects of physical
environmental stimuli in healthcare settings on the health and well-being of patients.
Background. The concept of healing environments suggests that the physical envi-
ronment of the healthcare setting can encourage the healing process and patients’
feelings of well-being. Understanding the effects of physical environmental stimuli
will allow us to design healthcare environments that generate these potential health
beneﬁts.
Method. A search was conducted using the MedLine, PsychInfo, Embase, CINAHL,
Iconda, ScienceDirect, Compendex and the ISI Citation Indexes databases. Studies
were included if they concerned interventions involving health effects of environ-
mental stimuli in healthcare settings on patients, and were based on controlled
clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Both clinical and psychological
outcome measures were included. The search was completed in 2005.
Findings. Of the over 500 potentially relevant studies identiﬁed, only 30 met all
criteria and were included in this review. Predominantly positive effects were
found for sunlight, windows, odour and seating arrangements. Inconsistent effects
were found for sound, nature, spatial layout, television and multiple stimuli
interventions. In general, both the size and direction of effects seem highly
dependent on characteristics of patient populations and healthcare settings.
Conclusions. Studies that manipulate several environmental stimuli simulta-
neously clearly support the general notion that the physical healthcare environ-
ment affects the well-being of patients. However, when scrutinizing the effects of
speciﬁc environmental stimuli, conclusive evidence is still very limited and difﬁcult
to generalize. The ﬁeld thus appears to be in urgent need of well-conducted,
controlled clinical trials. At present, and on the basis of the available research, it

Introduction
Traditionally, the emphasis on designing healthcare settings
was on the functional delivery of health care (Ulrich 1995).
Gradually, this emphasis shifted towards a perspective of
designing healthcare environments that are ‘psychologically
supportive’ (Ruga 1989), also referred to as healing environ-
ments (see Stichler 2001, Sloan Devlin & Arneill 2003,
Schweitzer et al. 2004). The concept of healing environments
suggests that the physical environment of healthcare settings
‘can make a difference in how quickly the patient recovers

(Stichler 2001, p. 2).
Understanding physical environmental stimuli in health-
care facilities will allow us to create environments that
positively affect the healing process and well-being of
patients. Healing environments are claimed to have beneﬁcial
effects on a variety of health indicators, such as anxiety,
blood pressure, postoperative recovery, the use of analgesic
medication, and the length of stay (Ulrich 1995). Moreover,
if relatively inexpensive alterations such as introducing plants
or colours can indeed shorten the length of stay, then these
environmental changes may also prove to be highly cost-
effective.
Previously conducted reviews on this topic (see Rubin et al.
1998, Ulrich et al. 2004, van den Berg 2005) clearly state that
environmental stimuli in the healthcare environment affect
patient outcomes. These reviews each make their own
contribution to the ﬁeld, whether by including non-clinical
evidence or by taking a broad scope involving both patients
and staff and also including stimuli that provide a direct
physiological hazard. However, a critical overview of meth-
odologically rigorous studies is still lacking. Such an overview
of the available conclusive evidence is needed to enable the
formulation of practice guidelines for evidence-based design
of healing healthcare facilities.
Physical environmental stimuli
Harris et al. (2002) distinguished three relevant dimensions of
the physical environment: architectural features, interior
design features and ambient features. Architectural features
are relatively permanent characteristics, such as the spatial
layout of a hospital, room size and window placement.
Interior design features are deﬁned as less permanent
elements, such as furnishings, colours and artwork. Ambient
features comprise lighting, noise levels, odours and tempera-
ture.
Another classiﬁcation, introduced by Rice et al. (1980),
subdivides physical environmental features into either purely
stimulus objects or interactional objects. This is illustrated by
the following example: plants – as an interior design feature –
may serve as stimulus objects when patients are passively
exposed to them (i.e. visually), whereas they become inter-
actional objects as soon as patients are actively involved in
taking care of them. This example also shows that some
features can be classiﬁed in both categories, depending on
how they are applied. This review is restricted to purely
stimulus objects.
Psychologically mediated effects
In general, there are two ways in which stimulus objects
can impact the health or well-being of patients. First, they
can have a direct physiological inﬂuence, meaning the
effects are mainly unmediated or unmoderated by psycho-
logical processes (Taylor et al. 1997). For example, a
carpeted ﬂoor contains more microorganisms than a vinyl
ﬂoor (Anderson et al. 1982) and may therefore have a
direct physiological inﬂuence on patients’ health by causing
more infections. Second, environmental stimuli may act
through psychological processes as a result of sensory
perceptions. These processes can be of a cognitive or an
emotional nature. For instance, the presence of plants in a
hospital bedroom may give the patient a more homely
feeling resulting in less anxiety, which in turn may promote
recovery.
This review is restricted to this second category of
processes. However, several stimuli inﬂuence health directly
as well as through mediation by psychological processes.
Carpeted ﬂoors, for instance, may not only have the
aforementioned, direct physiological effect, but also an
indirect effect by providing a more homely ambience or by
improving acoustic conditions. In these ambivalent cases,
studies were only included when the outcome measures
were indicative of psychologically mediated effects. Taking
the example of carpeted ﬂoors, we thus included studies
with outcome measures such as arousal or calmness, but
excluded
studies
measuring
the
number
of
respiratory
infections.
Environmental stimuli can also be (part of) a speciﬁc
medical treatment, as in light therapy for patients with
seasonal depression (Golden et al. 2005). Studies in which
environmental stimuli were applied as treatment were exclu-
ded from this review.
In summary, for the purpose of this review, physical
environmental stimuli were deﬁned as follows:
Physical environmental stimuli are part of the (shared) healthcare
environment and can be classiﬁed as ambient, architectural or
interior design features that are purely stimulus objects (i.e. not
interactional) and which inﬂuence patients through mediation by
psychological processes.
Aim
The aim of this review was to achieve a rigorous evidence
base that could serve as a source for both the design of
healthcare environments and for future research.
Search methods
The review was conducted using the Cochrane Collabor-
ation method (Alderson et al. 2003). Electronic searches
were carried out using databases on medicine, psychology
and architecture, namely MedLine, PsychInfo, Embase,
CINAHL, Iconda, ScienceDirect, Compendex and the ISI
Citation Indexes.
Some of the medical subject headings (MeSH) used in the
searches were: interior design and furnishings, hospital
design and construction, environment design and health
facility planning. However, they were neither adequate to
fully identify all relevant studies, nor were they suitable for
all databases used. Therefore, an additional set of search
terms was used for the type of healthcare setting (e.g.
hospital, waiting room), environmental stimuli (e.g. furni-
ture, colour) and outcome measures (e.g. well-being, blood
pressure), even though this meant over-selecting potentially
relevant studies. The following 17 environmental stimuli
were explicitly sought for: furniture, art, colour, nature,
plants, gardens, carpeting, room size, spatial layout, private
rooms, noise, music, odour (i.e. a smell, pleasant or
unpleasant), television/video, light, windows and view from
a window.
There were no limitations on the year in which the study
was published. The only language restriction was an abstract
provided in English, German, Spanish, French or Dutch. The
reference lists of the previously published reviews were also
sought (Rubin et al. 1998, Ulrich et al. 2004, van den Berg
2005) and the ﬁnal electronic search was performed in the
summer of 2005.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Criteria
for
considering
studies
for
this
review
were:
(i) interventions involving the health effects of environmental
stimuli in healthcare settings compared to other environmen-
tal stimuli, or with no environmental stimuli at all; (ii) clinical
trials with at least an adequate control group and published
in peer-reviewed journals; (iii) patients staying in a healthcare
setting for any length of time; and (iv) health-related outcome
measures. Clinical outcomes such as length of stay, medica-
tion intake or pain were included as were psychological
outcomes such as mood, stress or satisfaction with received
care. Environmental stimuli were deﬁned according to our
deﬁnition stated in the Introduction.
Studies that manipulate a single environmental stimulus – as
well as those manipulating multiple stimuli simultaneously –
were included. Studies were excluded if the environmental
intervention(s) were confounded with non-environmental
changes, such as changes in the nursing care policy.
Data extraction
For all the trials included, methodological quality was
assessed. Information about study design, baseline measure-
ments and data sources was extracted, as was information
about the environmental stimuli, participants (age, gender,
type of disease), healthcare setting (type and size) and
measurement tools used.
Results
Search results
The search strategy revealed 4075 papers. After applying the
inclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 533 papers remained
which were retrieved for a full-text screening. This screening
led to the exclusion of 290 non-empirical papers. Another 83
studies were excluded because they adopted study designs
other than controlled trials. Table 1 sets out other reasons
for exclusion. Thirty studies were ﬁnally included in this
review.
Methodological characteristics of the studies
Only controlled clinical trials were included to ensure
methodological quality. Of the 30 studies included, 18 could
be described as controlled clinical trials and two as random-
ized controlled clinical trials. The other 10 studies were
categorized as natural experiments, of which seven were
conducted retrospectively.
Most studies were not truly randomized, but groups
were comparable at baseline. However, baseline differences
were found for four studies but not adjusted in data
analyses. Data retrieved from patient admission forms and
automated
systems
were
assumed
to
be
reliable.
The
majority of the studies used self-reported measures as
outcomes and these were also assumed to be reliable. Data
collected in studies using observational measures were
judged to be reliable when two or more raters scored at
least 90% agreement or a kappa of 0Æ8. This was the case
in two observational studies. Four studies did not present a
kappa value.
Meta-analyses could not be executed due to the unique
characteristics of the interventions (30 studies on 17 different
environmental
stimuli),
healthcare
settings,
outcome
measures and patients, causing clinical heterogeneity.
Effects of physical environmental stimuli
No studies were retrieved that exclusively examined the
manipulation of the following environmental stimuli: colour,
art, plants, gardens, carpeting and room size. Most of these
stimuli, however, were manipulated simultaneously in com-
bination with several others.
In this review, we sought studies manipulating a single
environmental stimulus, as well as studies manipulating
multiple stimuli at the same time. These multiple stimuli
studies may support the general notion that the physical
healthcare environment is capable of affecting the health and

well-being of patients. The results of the multiple stimuli
studies will thus be presented ﬁrst.
Multiple stimuli
An entire renovation or redecoration project allowed for
the examination of the simultaneous effects of multiple
environmental stimuli. The 11 studies were subdivided into
type of setting (entire wards, treatment areas, waiting
rooms) and will be described below. If available, speciﬁcs
on the environmental stimuli modiﬁed can be found in
Table 2.
Entire wards
Outcome measures in the six trials that remodelled an entire
ward can be roughly divided into two types, namely: (1)
health- and behaviour-related measures; and (2) outcome
measures regarding appraisal of the physical environment.
Mainly positive effects were found on these environmental
appraisals. For the health and behaviour-related outcomes,
primarily involving cognitively impaired or older patients,
effects were highly inconsistent.
Holahan and Saegert (1973) found more socializing and
less isolated passive behaviour on a remodelled ward than on
a control ward, but found no differences for non-social active
behaviour. Christenfeld et al. (1989) also reported some
positive effects. They found that patients’ negative self-image
showed greater improvement in the remodelled wards. No
differences were found for depression, irritability and social
isolation.
Tyerman and Spencer (1980), on comparing an institu-
tional with a normalized ward, showed that the normalized
environment improved measures of occupation and activity,
but only slightly affected patterns of interaction and com-
munication. Remarkably, the normalized ward was associ-
ated with poorer self-help skills than the institutional ward.
Harwood and Ebrahim (1992) found even more negative
effects when comparing a new and purpose-built ward with a
refurbished one. The purpose-built ward showed no effects
on disability scores and mortality, whereas Barthel scores
(activities of daily living index) improved considerably for the
refurbished ward.
Stahler et al. (1984) compared a redecorated dayroom with
a control room. Although they found a positive result for
pathological behaviour, several negative effects were also
observed in the redecorated room. Isolated passive behaviour,
hostility and tension increased, whereas sociability and self-
maintenance skills decreased.
Olsen (1984) compared a progressive-care unit (a less
hospital-like environment) with a traditional unit and found
more positive effects on medical-surgical patients. Patients in
the progressive-care unit felt less conﬁned and more positive,
showed more social activity and mobility, and less passive
behaviour. There were no differences in perceived quality of
nursing care, perceived boredom and depression.
Three of these studies also measured subjective appraisals
of the physical healthcare environment. Holahan and Saegert
(1973) found more positive attitudes toward the physical
environment on the remodelled ward. Olsen’s (1984) pro-
gressive care unit was rated more pleasant and cheerful. The
effects found by Christenfeld et al. (1989) were less consis-
tent.
Treatment areas
Three trials focused on the effects of a total redecoration of
treatment areas. Two types of outcome measures were stud-
ied, namely appraisal of the physical environment and pa-
tient’s rating of their physician.
Janssen et al. (2000) compared the differences between
single room maternity care (SRMC) and a traditional delivery
care situation, using a satisfaction survey. The SRMC-group
rated the physical layout higher with respect to spaciousness,
availability of supplies, comfort of the support person and
lighting. Vielhauer Kasmar et al. (1968) found similar results
on comparing two contrasting counselling rooms, labelled as
either ugly or beautiful. The ugly room was rated less
favourably on several aspects. Swan et al. (2003) found that
patients even evaluated both food service and the whole
hospital more positively when staying in the more appealing
rooms. They also had stronger intentions to use the hospital
again. However, it should be noted that patients self-selected
the appealing room by paying $40 per day extra and may
therefore have been positively biased in their evaluations.
Patients in the study by Swan et al. (2003) also rated their
attending physician more favourably and a similar but non-
signiﬁcant tendency was also found for nurses. Similar effects
were found by Janssen et al. (2000). In their study, the
SRMC-group was not only more satisﬁed with the informa-
tion and support received, but also the nursing care was rated
higher. The results of Vielhauer Kasmar et al. (1968) are less
convincing with respect to these positive ﬁndings regarding
patients’ evaluation of the physicians and nurses. They
showed no main effects on patients’ rating of the physician.
Waiting rooms
Two trials studied redecorated waiting rooms. Here, positive
effects were also found for appraisals of the physical envi-
ronment.
Ingham and Spencer (1997) created three waiting room
layouts: a baseline condition, an increased de
´cor condition
and an added comfort condition. They found that dental
patients in the added comfort condition rated the practice as
more considerate than patients in the increased decor
condition, who rated the practice as more considerate than
those in the baseline condition. The quality of the practice
was rated lower by patients in the baseline condition than by
those in the other conditions. Patients in the added comfort
condition were more relaxed, secure and comfortable than
those in the other two conditions.
Leather et al. (2003) compared a redecorated environment
with a more traditional waiting area. They found that both
affective appraisal and satisfaction were higher for the
redecorated waiting area. No effects were found on self-
reported arousal.
The results of these multiple stimuli studies may support
the general notion that the physical healthcare environment
affects the behaviour and well-being of patients, but to
what speciﬁc environmental stimuli can these effects be
attributed? What clinical research is there that presents
conclusive evidence of the effects of speciﬁc environmental
stimuli?
Ambient features
The physical (healthcare) environment was distinguished into
three dimensions: ambient, architectural and interior design
features. With the ﬁrst dimension, the so-called ambiance of
the healthcare environment, included studies focused on
sunlight, sound and odour (see Table 3).
Sunlight
Findings from the four studies investigating the effect of
sunlight showed mainly positive effects on the length of stay,
mortality rate, perceived stress and pain. However, it should
be noted that detrimental effects were found for patients with
a speciﬁc type of depression, indicating that sunlight is not
necessarily beneﬁcial to all patients.
Beauchemin
and
Hays
(1996)
found
that
depressed
patients had a shorter length of stay (16Æ9 days) in sunny
rooms than those in dull rooms (19Æ5 days). Benedetti et al.
(2001) showed that patients with a bipolar depression had a
shorter length of stay (19Æ8 days) in rooms with morning
sunlight (with higher amounts of lux) than in rooms with
evening sunlight (23Æ5 days). Remarkably, for patients with
unipolar depression the difference was marginally signiﬁcant,
favouring evening sunlight rooms (20Æ9 days) to rooms with
morning sunlight (23Æ1 days).
Beauchemin and Hays (1998) found that patients with a
ﬁrst myocardial infarction had a shorter length of stay in
sunny rooms than in dull rooms, but the statistically

In a prospective study of the effects of sunlight, Walch et al.
(2005) showed that patients who had undergone spinal
surgery
and
were
exposed
to
higher-intensity
sunlight
experienced less perceived stress, marginally less pain, took
22% less analgesic medication, and thus accounted for pain
medication costs which were 21% lower.
For the studies by Benedetti et al. (2001) and Beauchemin
and Hays (1998), clinical heterogeneity was found, data from
Beauchemin and Hays (1996) were missing and could not be
retrieved, so meta-analysis was not possible.
Sound
Four trials studied the effects of different aspects of sound on
patient health and well-being. Mainly positive effects were
found if the intervention aimed to prevent negative effects of
noise. Adding sound to the environment as a positive dis-
tractor showed highly ambiguous results.
Hagerman et al. (2005) focused on preventing negative
effects of sounds. They studied the effect of noise-absorbing
ceiling tiles on patients admitted to an intensive coronary care
unit. The rehospitalization rate was statistically signiﬁcantly
higher in the bad acoustics group, as was the need for extra
intravenous beta-blockers. Subgroup analyses showed statis-
tically signiﬁcant effects favouring the noise-absorbing con-
dition for pulse amplitude in patients with acute myocardial
infarction and unstable angina pectoris. In addition to these
clinical outcomes, good acoustics positively affected per-
ceived quality of care.
Sound may also be included in the environment as a
positive distractor. Williamson (1992) studied the effects of
ocean sounds during the night on postoperative coronary
artery bypass graft patients after transfer from an ICU.
Patients hearing ocean sounds scored statistically signiﬁcantly
higher on a scale measuring self-reported sleep, indicating
better sleep.
Two trials were included that studied the effects of a
speciﬁc type of sound, namely music, as part of the ambient
environment. Ferguson et al. (1997) studied the effects of
music during blood donation and showed that playing music
had either detrimental or beneﬁcial effects on environmental
appraisals, depending on patient characteristics. Effects of
music on mood were negligible. Thorgaard et al. (2004)
studied the effects of music on the perceived pleasantness of
the sound in a cardiac laboratory. In the music group, 91% of
patients undergoing coronary procedures described the sound
environment as pleasant/very pleasant, compared with 56%
in the non-music group.
Odour
Only one study was included that studied the effects of
ambient odour. Lehrner et al. (2000) diffused an ambient
odour of orange essential oil in the waiting room of a dental
practice,
and
found
statistically
signiﬁcant
results
for
women only. Women in the odour group reported less
pretreatment state anxiety, improved mood and increased
calmness.
Architectural features
The second dimension of the physical healthcare environment
is the architectural features, i.e. the relatively permanent
aspects of the healthcare environment. Studies focused on
effects of windows and spatial layout (see Table 4).
Windows
Three studies investigated the effects of windows on the
health and well-being of patients. Research focused on the
presence or absence of windows, but also on the content of
the view afforded from them. Both the presence of windows
and a natural view have positive effects on clinical outcomes,
such as delirium, sleep and the length of stay.
Two studies investigated the effects of windows in inten-
sive care units (ICU) versus a situation without windows.
Keep et al. (1980) sent questionnaires to patients with
varying diagnoses after discharge. They found that those
treated in the ICU with windows remembered their admission
and discharge more accurately and had better orientation for
day of the week and time of day. They also experienced less
sleep disturbance and visual disturbance and suffered less
from hallucinations and delusions. Wilson (1972) studied the
effects of windows on surgical patients retrospectively. Data
were extracted from admission charts and demonstrated that
patients in the windowless unit had statistically signiﬁcantly
less delirium reactions following surgery.
One study focused on the content of the view from a
window. Ulrich (1984) retrospectively studied the effects of
a view of nature versus a view of a brick wall. Patients with a
natural view had shorter postoperative hospital stays, had
fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses, took fewer
moderate and strong analgesics doses and had slightly lower
scores for minor postsurgical complications.
Spatial layout
Three studies investigated the effects of changes in spatial
layout on patient health and well-being. Most effects of
spatial layout appear to be inconsistent, but some positive
effects were found concerning perceptions of privacy.
First, Pattison and Robertson (1996) compared a bay ward
(bays of four or more beds parallel with the corridor and the
external wall) with a Nightingale ward (long, single, open-
plan room) where female patients were nursed after surgical
procedures involving similar degrees of postoperative dis-
comfort. Patients scored higher on disturbance due to noise
on the Nightingale ward than on the bay ward, but no

differences were found in sleep scores. Marginally statistically
signiﬁcant differences for level of anxiety were found, with
higher levels of anxiety on the Nightingale than the bay ward.
The mean levels of depression were higher on the Nightingale
ward, but this effect was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Second, as a consequence of a different spatial layout, the
level of privacy may be affected. Barlas et al. (2001)
compared the effects on privacy of curtained areas in an
emergency department with rooms with solid walls. They
found that patients in the curtained areas believed more often
that they could overhear others and that others could hear
them, view them, hear personal information and view
personal parts of their bodies. In short, they perceived a
lower sense of privacy.
Dolce et al. (1985) assessed the use of narcotic analgesics in
orthopaedic inpatients with pain-related back disorders,
comparing private with semi-private rooms. They found no
differences in observed narcotic use between room types for
oral time-contingent, intramuscular time-contingent or oral
request-contingent medications. Intramuscular request-con-
tingent medication use was higher in private rooms than in
semi-private rooms. However, after controlling for other
variables in a multiple regression analysis, this effect of room
type appeared non-signiﬁcant.
Interior design features
The third dimension of the physical healthcare environment
comprises the interior design features, i.e. the less permanent
aspects of the healthcare environment. Here, research focused
on the effects of natural elements through images or video, on
the presence or absence of a television and on seating
arrangements (see Table 5).

Two trials involved the introduction of natural elements either through images or video. Some positive effects were
found on both pain control and pulse rate. However, most
effects resulting from these manipulations were either non-
signiﬁcant or only small.
Diette et al. (2003) compared the effects of natural murals
and nature sounds on patients undergoing ﬂexible bronchos-
copy with a control group without either. Pain control during
the procedure was better in the intervention group. No
differences in patient-reported anxiety were found. Ulrich
et al. (2003) studied the effects on blood donors by
comparing a videotape of a nature setting, a tape of an
urban environment, daytime television and a no-television
condition. Pulse rate was lower during Nature than Urban,

Television
Ulrich et al. (2003) used television to introduce natural elements in a healthcare setting. Pruyn and Smidts (1998), on

the waiting room had any effect on the waiting experience of
patients. Watching intensity appeared highly dependent on

does not serve as a distractor in a waiting room in terms of
changes in the waiting experience when compared to a
waiting room without a TV.
Seating arrangements
Holahan (1972) studied the effect of different seating
arrangements on hospitalized male psychiatric patients. He
observed that in sociopetal (i.e. encouragement of interactions) and mixed arrangements statistically signiﬁcantly more
social and personal interactions occurred than in sociofugal
(i.e.

and

arrangements.
Discussion
Limitations
The purpose of this review was to achieve a rigorous evidence
base of the effects of physical environmental stimuli on the
health and well-being of patients. The systematic search and
selection process revealed only 30 studies in which these
effects were rigorously investigated.
This number of included studies is surprisingly low when
compared with the number of studies retrieved in previously
conducted reviews on this subject (Rubin et al. 1998, Ulrich
et al. 2004, van den Berg 2005). This difference is mainly
caused by the fact that we only included controlled clinical
trials, whereas the previous reviews included almost all types
of study designs.
It could be argued that this limitation regarding study
design was too stringent. Clearly, by excluding all other study
designs in this review, a large body of potentially supportive
evidence is discarded. However, this supportive body of
evidence had already been incorporated in the earlier reviews.
Moreover, the explicit purpose of this review was to collect
the available conclusive evidence, allowing the formulation of
practice guidelines for evidence-based design. This necessarily
implies a critical selection on the basis of methodological
rigour. As randomized and controlled clinical trials are
generally accepted as the most reliable methodology for
assessing effects of healthcare interventions (Schulz et al.
1995), the inclusion criteria used in this review seem justiﬁed.
By using the Cochrane review methodology, the research in
the ﬁeld of healing environments was subjected to the same
rigour as is generally accepted in clinical research and
practice.
Results of the review
Three relevant dimensions of environmental stimuli were
distinguished, namely ambient, architectural and interior
design features. Of the 30 included trials, 11 appeared to
study a simultaneous manipulation of multiple environmental
stimuli. Stimuli such as colour, art, plants, gardens, carpeting
and room size were not studied in isolation from other
environmental stimuli, but most of these stimuli were
manipulated simultaneously in combination with several
others.
The multiple stimuli studies concerned redesigning waiting
rooms, treatment areas and entire wards. For several of these
studies, positive effects were found for patients’ environmental appraisal, but with regard to patients’ evaluations of
physicians and nurses, the results were less convincing.
Conﬂicting results were also demonstrated for social behaviour and no effects were found on clinical outcomes. It could
be concluded that renovating or redesigning healthcare
environments in general is appreciated by patients, but
evidence of clinical effects is still lacking. Moreover, the
conﬂicting results for social behaviour also show that
renovation may have negative consequences for speciﬁc types
of patients and should therefore be planned carefully.
Nine included trials studied ambient features. Positive
effects were found for several ambient features, with the
most convincing results for exposure to sunlight. However,
speciﬁc effects appeared to be highly dependent on the
characteristics of the patient population. Designers should
thus
be prudent
when using
these ﬁndings to
design
healthcare environments.
The six trials that studied architectural features showed
inconsistent effects: positive effects on both clinical and
psychological
outcomes
and
statistically
non-signiﬁcant
outcomes on several measures. Methodological ﬂaws in
most of these trials, moreover, impede drawing causal
inferences. For example, the reported effects of windows
may
have
been
confounded
by
varying
amounts
of
daylight or by the content of the view, which were not
considered.
Isolated interior design features were researched in only
four trials. Adding natural elements only caused slightly
positive effects. Seating arrangements have effects on social
interactions, but a television set does not improve the waiting
experience. In general, for interior design features the
available evidence is very limited. Although interior design
features were involved in several of the multiple stimuli trials,
it is difﬁcult to attribute positive effects from these trials to
speciﬁc features.
Remarkably, the previously conducted reviews that included all types of evidence tended to draw considerably more
favourable conclusions with respect to the power of healing
environments than this review. This suggests that studies with
less rigorous methodology tend to show more positive results
than more rigorously controlled trials – an inference also
drawn by Rubin et al. (1998).
Conclusions
The ﬁeld appears to be in urgent need of well-conducted,
controlled clinical trials. We sought 17 different environ-
What is already known about this topic
• The focus in designing healthcare facilities is shifting
from an emphasis on the functional delivery of care
towards healing environments which are also psycho-
logically supportive.
• The physical healthcare environment is believed to
affect the health and well-being of patients.
What this paper adds
• Only 30 well-conducted controlled clinical trials were
found on the effects of environmental stimuli on the
health and well-being of patients.
• The general notion that the physical healthcare environment affects the well-being of patients is supported,
but conclusive evidence is still limited or lacking with
regard to speciﬁc environmental stimuli.

windows and odour, but the effects of sound, nature,
spatial layout, television and multiple stimuli interventions were inconsistent.
• At this stage, formulating guidelines for evidence-based

mental stimuli as possible interventions to affect the health
and well-being of patients. We found only 30 trials that met
the criteria for both relevance and methodology.
Studies manipulating several environmental stimuli simul-
taneously support the general notion that the physical
healthcare environment affects patient well-being. However,
when looking at the effects of speciﬁc environmental stimuli,
conclusive evidence is still very limited and difﬁcult to
generalize.
Single environmental stimuli thus need to be explored
further. Several environmental stimuli, such as colour, have
still not been studied rigorously, whereas the evidence for
other environmental stimuli is still inconclusive. Effects of
many stimuli appeared to be highly dependent on the
characteristics of the patient population. Most stimuli have
thus far been studied in only one or two trials, leaving no
scope for analysing the effects for different patient populations or pool results in meta-analyses.
Also, possible interactions between different environmental
stimuli need further exploration. It is likely that the effects of
different environmental stimuli will reinforce or weaken one
another. In none of the 11 multiple stimuli trials were such
interactions studied.
Furthermore, a clear understanding of the cognitive and
emotional processes through which the effects can be
mediated or moderated, is imperative. Insight into these
processes may provide us with the necessary information to
develop truly evidence-based healthcare environments.
At present, and on the basis of the available research, the
formulation
of
evidence-based
guidelines
for
designing
healthcare environments would be premature. Nevertheless,
the available evidence indicates that the concept of healing
environments remains a promising ﬁeld for future clinical
research.

10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282f1be6e,The architecture of safety: Hospital design,2007,,"Introduction
A growing body of research has shown that hospital
design may directly impact safety in hospitals. It may
also indirectly impact safety by triggering adverse events
that cause harm to patients and staff. In addition, hospital
design may also impact safety in hospitals by working as a
barrier to harmful events. This is an emerging ﬁeld of
research, and the effects of hospital design on safety are
not always well understood. There is no single database
in the ﬁeld. High quality research articles are also rare,
because many confounding variables are present. As a
result, this review includes evidence that was not always
generated in critical care settings. Nevertheless, all
evidence presented here should also be relevant to
critical care.
The role of hospital design in patient safety
Hospital design refers to the physical environment that
includes the indoor environment (e.g. noise, air quality
and lighting), the interior design (e.g. furniture, ﬁxtures
and materials) and the conﬁguration (e.g. relative
locations and adjacencies of spaces) of a hospital. Accord-
ing to the model of system accidents proposed by Reason
[1], hospital design may impact patient safety, directly or
indirectly, as a latent failure and a barrier.
Reason [1] argued that adverse events in hospitals are
related to both active and latent failures. Active failures
are unsafe acts (slips, lapses, fumbles, mistakes and
procedural violations) committed by the individuals in
direct contact with the patient. In contrast, latent failures
create local conditions that in speciﬁc situations may lead
to active failures. Latent failures may become embedded
within systems as a result of wrong decisions made by
designers, builders, procedure writers and top level
management [2]. As a latent failure, hospital design
can directly impact safety outcomes or it can impact staff
outcomes negatively (e.g. staff stress, fatigue, annoyance,
lack of control, lack of motivation, and lack of communication) leading to accidents and errors.
Reason [1] also argued that design barriers may be critical
to preventing harmful accidents in hospitals. Whereas a
poorly designed and maintained hospital provides the
conditions that precipitate accidents, a well-designed
hospital can have inbuilt safeguards/barriers that may
make it difﬁcult for these accidents to occur or that
may help stop the chain of events before they result
in accidents.
Purpose of review
This paper reviews recent research literature reporting the
effects of hospital design on patient safety.
Recent ﬁndings
Features of hospital design that are linked to patient safety
in the literature include noise, air quality, lighting conditions,
patient room design, unit layout, and several other interior
design features. Some of these features act as latent
conditions for adverse events, and impact safety outcomes
directly and indirectly by impacting staff working conditions.
Others act as barriers to adverse events by providing
hospital staff with opportunities for preventing accidents
before they occur.
Summary
Although the evidence linking hospital design to patient
safety is growing, much is left to be done in this area of
research. Nevertheless, the evidence reported in the
literature may already be sufﬁcient to have a positive impact
on hospital design.

Hospital design cannot, however, be considered in iso-
lation with regard to patient and staff safety. In almost all
safety situations, hospital design interacts with a host of
other factors, such as the culture of the organization, tasks
and processes in place, and tools and technology. This
paper primarily focuses on the role of hospital design
while recognizing the contributing role played by other
critical factors.
Direct impacts on patient safety
Aspects of hospital design such as air quality, lighting,
patient room design and other interior design elements
can directly impact safety outcomes such as nosocomial
infections, patient falls and medical errors.
Air quality and nosocomial infections
Airborne infections are spread when dust and pathogens
are released during hospital construction [3–5,6] and are
caused by contamination and malfunction of hospital
ventilation systems [7–10]. Studies in hospitals show
that fungal load in the air may be linked to humidity,
temperature and construction activity [6]. High-efﬁciency particulate air (HEPA) ﬁlters can be highly effective in preventing airborne infections in hospitals [11]. Air
contamination is least in laminar airﬂow rooms with
HEPA ﬁlters, and this approach is recommended for such
areas as operating-room suites and ultraclean rooms for
immunocompromised patients [11,12,13]. Yavuz et al.
[13] found lower rates of sternal surgical site infections in
the newer operating rooms with laminar ﬂoor ventilation
systems
and
automatically
closing
doors
compared
with the older operating rooms with standard plenum
ventilation and doors that did not close properly.
Single bedrooms and nosocomial infections
Ulrich et al. [14] identiﬁed 16 studies linking the number
of patients in a room to nosocomial infection rates. The
European Prevalence of Infection Control in Intensive
Care study reported an odds ratio for infection of 1.3 in
intensive care units (ICUs) with more than 11 beds
compared with those with fewer than ﬁve beds. That
study, however, did not report any ﬁndings related to
open versus closed rooms [15]. Mullin et al. [16] reported
a decrease in Acinetobacter baumanii in mechanically
ventilated patients, from 28.1 to 5%, after moving from
a unit with both enclosed and open patient care areas to
one with all private rooms.
In general, the reported evidence shows that single-bed
patient rooms with high-quality HEPA ﬁlters and with
negative or positive pressure ventilation are more effective
in preventing air-borne pathogens. The evidence also
shows that multibed rooms are more difﬁcult to decontaminate and have more surfaces that act as a reservoir for
pathogens. On the basis of the study ﬁndings, the 2006
American Institute of Architects Guidelines for Design
and Construction of Healthcare Facilities has adopted the
single bed room as the standard for all new construction
in the United States [17]. In addition, several other
professional and scientiﬁc bodies in the United Kingdom,
the United States, and Europe have published ICU design
guidelines that include similar design measures to control
nosocomial infections [18].
Lighting conditions and patient outcomes
A large body of literature reports different psychological
and physiological effects of lighting in hospitals, some of
which may be directly related to patient safety. For
example, ‘ICU psychosis’ in adult patients can be partly
attributed to bright or constant lighting conditions in ICUs
that lack night/day cues. A similar phenomenon has been
described among children in pediatric ICUs [19,20]. In
addition, the mortality rate may be higher in dull patient
rooms, with sex having differential effects [21,22].
Furthermore, poor lighting conditions may negatively
impact physiological developments among infants [23].
Those studies suggest that lighting conditions should be
considered more carefully in the design of patient care
areas of a hospital.
Lighting conditions and medical errors
Performance on visual tasks gets better as light levels
increase [24]. Buchanan et al. [25] found that errors in
dispensing medications in a high volume outpatient
pharmacy were signiﬁcantly lower at an illumination level
of 146 foot-candles (2.6%) as opposed to the baseline
level of 45 foot candles (3.8%). In Alaska, Roseman and
Booker [26] found that 58% of all medication errors
among hospital workers occurred during the ﬁrst quarter
of the year when daylight hours were less. Studies in
ofﬁces have indicated the importance of appropriate
lighting levels for complex tasks requiring excellent
vision [27], but no such study has been reported in
hospitals.
Noise in hospitals and patient outcomes
Noise levels in most hospitals are higher than World
Health Organization recommendations [28]. The level
of noise in the ICU ranges from 50 to 75 dB, with peaks of
up to 85 dB [29]. Parthasarathy and Tobin [30] reported
that 20% of all arousals and awakenings among ICU
patients are related to noise. They argued that sleep
disruption
can
induce
sympathetic
activation
and
elevation of blood pressure, which may contribute to
patient morbidity. ‘ICU psychosis’ in adult ICUs and
in pediatric ICUs has also been partly attributed to a high
level of noise in these areas [19,20]. Common sources of
noise in hospitals may include telephones, alarms, trolleys,
ice machines, paging systems, nurse shift change, staff
caring for other patients, doors closing, staff conversations,
and patients crying out or coughing [31]. Cropp et al. [32]
counted 33 different audio signals in a respiratory critical
care unit. Ten were critical alarms requiring immediate
nursing action, whereas the others did not require immedi-
ate action or were unnecessary.It is clear that patient safety
as it relates to hospital noise can easily be improved if
proper design and management measures are in place.
Hospital design and patient falls
A report by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations cited the physical environment
as a root cause in 50% of patient falls [33], but studies
have shown contradictory evidence on the topic. A recent
review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
did not ﬁnd any evidence for the independent effective-
ness of environmental modiﬁcation programmes on
patient falls [34]. Some studies, however, have shown
that most patient falls occurred in the patient room and
that bedrails were the only design element linked
strongly with falls [35]. Other studies have shown that
comprehensive multi-intervention strategies that include
environmental modiﬁcations could be effective in reducing falls [35,36–38].
Among speciﬁc interior design elements, ﬂooring can
contribute to the incidence of falls and the severity of
injuries upon impact [39]. Donald et al. [40] reported
fewer falls of geriatric patients on vinyl ﬂoors compared
with carpeted ﬂoors in a rehabilitation ward. That study
lacked sufﬁcient power, however. Healey [41], on the
other hand, reported that patients suffer more injuries
when they fall on vinyl ﬂoors compared with carpeted
ﬂoors. Simpson et al. [42] reported that subﬂoors may
impact the injury from falls, with the risk of fracture being
lower for wooden subﬂoors compared with concrete
subﬂoors.
Impact of the environment on staff working
conditions
A poorly designed physical environment creates latent
conditions such as staff stress, fatigue, annoyance, burnout
and lack of handwashing compliance that may potentially
lead to adverse events in hospitals.
Noise in hospitals and staff outcomes
Studies have shown that noise is strongly related to stress
and annoyance among nurses, and that noise-induced
stress is related to emotional exhaustion and burnout
among critical care nurses [43,44]. Healthcare staff have
reported that the excessively high noise levels at work
interfere with their work and impact patient comfort and
recovery [45]. Blomkvist and colleagues [46] examined
the effects of changing the acoustic conditions (using
sound-absorbing versus sound-reﬂecting ceiling tiles) on
the same group of nurses in a coronary ICU. During the
periods of improved acoustic conditions, many positive
outcomes
were
observed
among
staff,
including
improved speech intelligibility, reduced perceived work
demands and perceived pressure and strain [46]. There is
convincing evidence that noise is a latent condition for
errors in hospitals and strategies must be adopted to
reduce noise.
Variable acuity patient rooms and transfers
Patients are transferred from one room to another as often
as three to six times during their short stay in hospital in
order to receive the care that matches their level of acuity
[47,48]. Delays, communication discontinuities, loss of
information and changes in computers and systems
during patient transfer may contribute to increased
medical errors, loss of staff time and productivity [48,49].
Hendrich and colleagues [47,48] developed an innovative
demonstration project called the Cardiac Comprehensive
Critical Care at Clarian Methodist Hospital in Indiana-
polis to address patient transfer and associated errors.
The project provided different levels of care in a single
patient room to minimize patient transfer as acuity levels
changed. For this, each patient room was equipped with
an acuity adaptable headwall, and all nurses on the unit
were trained to respond to patients with varying acuity
levels. The impact of this 56-bed variable acuity unit on
different outcomes was measured by comparing 2 years of
baseline data (before the move) and 3 years of data after
the move. The authors reported signiﬁcant postmove
improvements in many key areas: patient transfers
decreased by 90%, medication errors by 70%, and there
was also a drastic reduction in the number of falls. This
path-breaking project demonstrated the potential impact
of acuity-adaptable care in dealing with patient ﬂow and
safety issues while improving the model of care. Since
this project, many hospitals across the United States
have adopted some variations of the concept, although
the impacts of these changes on outcomes remain to be
studied.
Unit layout and staff effectiveness
Nurses spend a lot of time walking, which includes the
time to locate and gather supplies and equipment and to
ﬁnd other staff members [50]. One study found that
28.9% of nursing staff time was spent walking [51]. This
came second only to patient-care activities, which
accounted for 56.9% of staff time. Unnecessary walking
leads to a waste of precious staff time and adds to fatigue
and stress among staff.
Studies seem to suggest that bringing staff and supplies
physically and visually closer to the patient may help
reduce walking [52,53]. To take advantage of the idea,
many hospitals incorporate decentralized nurses’ stations
and supplies’ servers next to patient rooms (as opposed to
locating everything at a single central location). Hendrich
and colleagues [48] argued that such a layout may help
reduce walking and supply trips. As a result, nursing time
may increase signiﬁcantly allowing for a reduction in
budgeted stafﬁng care hours while increasing the time
spent in direct patient care activities. An in-depth dis-
cussion on how various aspects of unit design, patient
room design and staff areas may contribute to staff
effectiveness is provided in the review of best practice
examples of adult ICUs designed between 1993 and 2003
by Rashid [54].
Accessibility to handwashing stations and handwashing
compliance
Surface transmission of pathogens accounts for a majority
of nosocomial infections, and low handwashing frequency
among healthcare staff (generally below 50%) is a
key factor contributing to this problem [55]. Design
factors that discourage handwashing include: difﬁculty
of access, poor visibility, poor height placement, lack of
redundancy, and wide spatial separation of resources that
are used sequentially while washing hands [55–58].
Studies report conﬂicting evidence on the effects of
physicaldesignonhandwashing compliance.Some studies
found that handwashing compliance was greater in units
with higher sink to bed ratios [59,60]. One study found no
signiﬁcantimprovementinhandwashingafteramovefrom
an open ward design to a layout with single patient rooms
and higher sink to bed ratios [61]. Trick and colleagues
[62] found that hand hygiene improved during the study
period in three intervention hospitals (where interventions
included the increased availability of alcohol-based hand
rubs, an interactive education programme and a poster
campaign) but not at the control hospital (where the only
intervention was the increased availability of alcohol hand
rubs). Those and other studies seem to suggest that a
multistrategy intervention that includes staff education as
well as easy visual and physical access to sinks, standard
locations of sinks in all patient rooms, comfortable sink
heights and alcohol-based dispensers may be more effec-
tive in increasing handwashing compliance [55,58].
Environmental barriers/defenses to
healthcare accidents
The environment potentially acts as a defense to adverse
events by providing opportunities for staff and families to
prevent accidents before they occur.
Visibility to patients
One important way to avert adverse events related to
patients is for the staff to have the ability to observe
patients continuously and provide assistance as needed.
Multiple decentralized nurse work areas and charting
alcoves next to patient rooms may help facilitate this
activity. Such designs enable the staff to attend patients’
needs without delays. In at least one prospective study,
Hendrich [63] showed that falls were cut by two-thirds,
from six per 1000 patients to two per 1000, after a move
from an old unit with a centralized nursing station to a
new unit with decentralized observation units. Additional
research is needed to determine the effects of decentralization on patient safety.
Visibility to patients also seems to be related to perceived
safety. In a staff survey by France et al. [64] at a new
neonatal ICU and pediatric critical care unit at a children’s
hospital (designed with single patient rooms, curtains for
privacy for families, larger unit size, but with poor
sightlines between staff and patients), a majority of the
respondents believed that the facility design made team
communication and patient monitoring difﬁcult ,and that it
limited social interaction among staff. Therefore, while
making major facility changes it is critical to take into
consideration patient needs for privacy as well as staff
needs for monitoring and communication.
Presence of family
Another effective way to avert adverse events is to allow
the patient’s family to be a part of the patient care process.
In order to understand how teamwork and communication
involving the patient’s family may contribute to patient
safety, Uhlig and colleagues conducted multidisciplinary
collaborative rounds at the patient bedside in 1999 in a
cardiac surgery programme in Concord, New Hampshire
[65]. These rounds also involved the patient’s family. The
team participated in 10-min brieﬁngs at the patient’s
bedside at the start of the day, and reviewed the patient’s
care plan, discussed medication and addressed anything
that went wrong in an open, blame-free environment
[53,64]. After these changes, patient mortality rates
declined signiﬁcantly [66].
In order to include families as active participants in the
care process it is important to provide spaces for families
in the patient room and on the unit where they can spend
extended periods of time. Single rooms have clear
advantage over multibed rooms in this regard as a result
of increased privacy [14,67]. A survey of nurses in four
hospitals found that nurses gave high ratings to single
rooms for accommodating family members but accorded
double rooms low scores [67]. In addition to these
factors, organizational policies such as those that limit
family visitation hours may inﬂuence family involvement
and satisfaction with care.
Conclusion
Hospital design may help improve patient safety directly
by reducing nosocomial infections, patient falls, medi-
cation errors and, sometimes, even by reducing patient
morbidity and mortality. Hospital design may also help
improve patient safety indirectly by reducing staff stress,
staff walking and patient transfer, and by improving
handwashing compliance. In contrast, very little has been
reported recently on the role of hospital design as a barrier
to adverse events in hospitals. Although research on the
links between hospital design and safety has increased
over the past few years, there is still a need for more
focused studies. Some reported contradictions on these
links also need to be resolved. Meanwhile, the growing
body of evidence in the ﬁeld may already have an impact
on how hospitals should be designed in the coming years.

reduced noise and anxiety. This pilot study focused on nurses’ perception of the advantages and
disadvantages of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy patient rooms in medical–surgical units in
four hospitals in the northwest. A majority of respondents in the four hospitals favored single rooms
over double-occupancy rooms for the majority of the 15 categories, including the following:
appropriateness for patient examination, interaction with or accommodation of family members, and
lower probability of dietary mix-ups. Future studies need to carefully examine the objective measures
of patient care variables (e.g., incidents of medication errors, opportunities for surveillance), patient
outcomes (e.g., recovery rate, falls), and implications of room occupancy on operating costs.

1. Background
Demographic changes in the United States, such as the
aging of the baby-boom generation, increasing life expec-
tancy, and continued immigration, could result in a 46%
increase in bed demand in hospitals by 2027 (Solucient,
2003). An increasing number of patients attend hospitals
with a higher level of acuity, requiring complex care. In
addition, the continuous upgrading in medical technology
has generated the need for built-in flexibility in the design of
hospital facilities. A recent extensive review of the literature
evidence-based design in acute care settings has demonstrated that patient-centered and psychologically supportive
acute care environments facilitate positive patient outcomes,
such as increased patient privacy, increased patient control
over personal information, and increased opportunity to rest
and to discuss needs with family members and friends. The
challenge for today’s hospital designers and administrators
is to design patient rooms that promote therapeutic goals,
foster positive patient outcomes, and function as intensive
care rooms.
Single-patient rooms have become the industry standard
in the construction of new acute care facilities in the United
States. Health care design professionals, planners, and
administrators argue that private patient rooms reduce the
possibility for infection, reduce patient stress levels,
facilitate nurses’ and health care workers’ ability to do their
jobs efficiently, provide adequate space for family members
to participate in the healing process of the patients, and
provide more privacy for the delivery of bedside treatments
and for sensitive discussions with health care personnel
(e.g., Bacon, 1920; Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Gallant &
Lanning, 2001; Hill-Rom, 2002; Ulrich, 2003; Ulrich et al.,
2004). However, are these claims supported by empirical
evidence? How does this need to address increased acuity,
as well as the need to promote therapeutic outcomes, affect
patient density issues in patient room design?
A systematic review of the literature by the authors
demonstrated that single-occupancy rooms compared to
multioccupancy rooms are more suitable for infection control
and patient care issues (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Muto
et al., 2003; Ulrich et al., 2004). However, no study on the
nursing staff members’ perception of single-occupancy and
multioccupancy patient rooms in acute care settings as it
relates to patient care issues was found. The objective of this
research was to conduct an exploratory pilot study to explore
nursing staff members’ perception of the advantages and
disadvantages of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy
patient rooms in medical–surgical units.
The research questions guiding this study were as
follows:
1. What are the differences in operating costs, efficiency
of management, care delivery, and disease control in
single-occupancy and double-occupancy patient
rooms in acute care settings?
2. What are the therapeutic impacts (socio-behavioral
issues of patient privacy, social interaction, and daily
functioning) of single-occupancy versus double-occu-
pancy hospital rooms?
A summary of the literature on single-occupancy and
multioccupancy patient rooms is presented below to provide
background information for this study (a detailed summary of
this review is provided in Chaudhury, Mahmood, & Valente,
in press). This review was conducted through a keyword

fied by a systematic review of issues of relevant journals/
magazines in the area of health care design, management, and
infection control.1 Finally, the reference lists for included
articles that dealt directly with room occupancy issues were
inspected, followed by a systematic review of issues of
relevant journals/magazines in the area of health care
design, management, and infection control.
2. Key findings from the literature
The major issues of the literature were synthesized in
three categories, and articles in each category were
subdivided into empirical and nonempirical articles.2 The
three categories are as follows:
1. Cost issues of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy rooms
2. Infection control
3. Health care facility management/patient care and
therapeutic impacts.
In terms of cost and management issues, the articles were
mainly nonempirical and prescriptive in nature. The focus of
the limited number of empirical studies identified by the
researchers was mainly infection control issues (e.g., the
need for isolation to limit the spread of nosocomial
infection), with a few studies examining the therapeutic
benefits of single-occupancy rooms (e.g., Burden, 1998;
Kulik, Moore, & Mahler, 1993).
2.2. Cost issues of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy
rooms
Most of the articles reviewed on cost issues were
descriptive articles in the form of opinions or guidelines.3
The opinions expressed in these articles emphasized that
operating costs are reduced in single-patient rooms com-
pared with multioccupancy rooms due to reduction in
transfer cost, higher bed occupancy rates, and reduction in
labor cost. However, the authors often cautioned that this
cost reduction could be better achieved when conversion to
single room is paired with other healing environment design
principles. Some authors (Hill-Rom, 2002; Ulrich, 2003)
have argued that cost savings due to reduction in transfers
are particularly applicable with acuity-adaptable rooms.
2 Articles providing primary data were included in the discussion of
empirical studies, and articles that were descriptive in nature or provided a
review of the literature were included in the discussion of nonempirical
studies.
3 A few empirical articles were identified in Section 2.1, and they dealt
with overall cost issues in the hospital and did not focus on patient room
types and associated costs. Articles that dealt with infection control and cost
were grouped in Section 2.2.
According to some authors (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas,
2000), even with higher first or unit costs of construction,
furniture, maintenance, housekeeping, energy (e.g., heating
and ventilation), and nursing, single occupancy can match the
per-diem cost of multibed rooms because of higher occupancy rates. Additionally, others have argued that medication
errors are reduced in single-occupancy rooms in comparison
to multioccupancy rooms, resulting in reduced costs (e.g.,
Hill-Rom, 2002; Morrissey, 2003).
2.3. Infection control in single-occupancy versus
multioccupancy rooms
Most empirical articles on patient room issues were in the
area of infection control.4 The nonempirical articles were
either guidelines or reviews of the literature on existing
studies on infections (e.g., Muto et al., 2003; Sehulster &
Chinn, 2003). Both empirical and nonempirical articles
highlight that infected patients or patients who are highly
susceptible to infections need to be isolated in private rooms
with proper ventilation systems and barrier protections to
stop infection from spreading or to reduce the possibility of
the development of a new infection. Ongoing research
demonstrates that nosocomial infection rates are low in
private rooms with proper design and ventilation systems;
however, the data from these studies have not yet been
published (The Center for Health Design, 2003).
In areas with specific types of infections, Kappstein and
Daschner (1991) argued the need for private rooms for
patients with staphylococcal pneumonia, skin lesions, or
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The Society of
Healthcare and Epidemiology of America guidelines rec-
ommend isolation for patients with vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus. In studies of transmission of hospital-
acquired diarrhea, researchers have discovered that the
transfer of different types of diarrhea occurred between
patients sharing rooms and toilets (Korpela, Karpanoja,
Taipalinen, & Siitonen, 1995). Clostridium difficile-associ-
ated diarrhea (CDAD) is endemic in many hospitals; results
in high average hospital stay, high average cost per case, and
significant morbidity in patients; affects nurses’ workloads;
and adds to the cost of cleaning and laundry. Research has
demonstrated that physical proximity to a patient with
CDAD and the number of antibiotics taken were significant
risk factors for the acquisition of nosocomial CDAD (Chang
& Nelson, 2000). Additionally, research has demonstrated
that the isolation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients in
hematology wards prevented patient-to-patient nosocomial
HCV transmission (Allander et al., 1995; Silini et al., 2002).
Caution must be used when interpreting results from
infection control literature because findings and recommendations are often based on retrospective investigations of
infection outbreaks in particular hospitals and associated
contextual variables. They may or may not be applicable to
other acute care environments.
4 The articles cited in this section are empirical, unless noted otherwise.
2.4. Therapeutic benefits of single-occupancy versus
multioccupancy rooms
Empirical (e.g., Burden, 1998) and nonempirical litera-
ture (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Shumaker & Reizem-
stein, 1982) point out that single-occupancy rooms increase
patients’ privacy; provide patients with control over
personal information, an opportunity to rest, and an
opportunity to discuss their needs with family members
and friends; and reduces noise and crowding. A few
scholars (e.g., Gallant & Lanning, 2001; Ulrich, 2003) and
hospital designers have argued that specially designed
private rooms (such as universal rooms or acuity-adaptable
rooms), compared with traditional private rooms, may better
serve the therapeutic goals of hospitals.5
Empirical studies have demonstrated that excess noise
can lead to increased anxiety and pain perception, loss of
sleep, and prolonged convalescence (Baker, Garvin, Ken-
nedy, & Polivka, 1993; Hilton, 1985). The influence of
room occupancy on the type of pain medication usage is
mixed. Some researchers discovered that patients in private
rooms were more likely to use narcotics than were similar
patients in semiprivate rooms, which may be due to
decreased environmental stimuli in private rooms, whereas
others have demonstrated that pain medication intake is less
in single-occupancy rooms (Dolce, Doleys, Raczynsk, &
Crocker, 1985). Mixed results were also obtained in studies
and surveys of patients’ preferences for room design. This
might be partly attributable to variations in subjective
thresholds for pain tolerance in patients, quality of
emotional support provided by staff and family, and
variations of environmental quality within private rooms
5 Universal rooms or acuity-adaptable rooms are a current trend in
design, especially in hospitals that are promoting patient-centered care and
family participation in a patient’s healing program. These rooms are all
private rooms. Results from a limited number of studies have indicated that
medication errors, patient falls, and procedural problems may be reduced in
acuity-adaptable rooms (Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Gallant & Lanning,
2001; Hill-Rom, 2002; Spear, 1997). However, these results may be
specific to the particular institutions studied. A more detailed study with
examples from multiple hospitals is required before drawing specific
conclusions.

across different studies. The majority of patients prefer
single rooms because of greater privacy, reduced noise,
reduced embarrassment, improved quality of sleep, opportunity for family members to stay, and avoidance of
upsetting other patients (Pease & Finlay, 2002). In addition,
both empirical (e.g., Hilton, 1985) and nonempirical articles
(e.g., Ulrich, 2003; Ulrich et al., 2004) have stated that
multiple-occupancy rooms are associated with lack of
privacy, higher noise level, and sleep disturbance.
As mentioned earlier, private rooms are the trend in
hospital planning and design. Both empirical and nonempirical literature demonstrate the advantages of single-occupancy rooms as improvements in patient care, a reduction in the
risk of cross-infection, and greater flexibility in operation.
However, the literature also highlights that it is important to
view and interpret the benefits of single-occupancy rooms
within the context of patient care issues, other environmental
changes, and management policy changes to bring about
desired and sustainable outcomes.
3. Method
Based on the abovementioned literature, a survey
instrument was designed to collect data on patient care,
management, and infection control issues from nursing staff.
The research methodology was reviewed and approved by
the authors’ university Institutional Review Board and also
by senior administrators at the hospital sites. This instrument was pilot tested with nursing staff members in four
hospitals in the Pacific Northwest6 to gain insights into their
perception of single-occupancy and multioccupancy rooms
as it relates to patient care issues. Cross-sectional data were
collected from nursing staff members (e.g., nurse managers,
charge nurses, etc.) through structured surveys.
Various scales were used to gather data on respondents’
perception of each type of patient room in terms of their
physical environmental features and beneficial attributes as
they relate to patient care issues. Respondents were asked 15
questions. Using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1=very low;
5=very high), they rated single-occupancy and double-
6 Researchers focused on hospitals in the Pacific Northwest for pilot
study due to geographic proximity. Multiple hospitals in the Seattle and
Portland areas were contacted, and four hospitals consenting to participate
in the study were included. This article is based on a study that is part of a
larger project that included a literature review and first cost analysis of
hospital medical–surgical units. Thus, this study required access to the
architectural plans of these hospitals. The four hospitals that consented to
share the plans of specific medical–surgical units and to participate in the
survey were selected for the study.

occupancy rooms in their hospitals as they relate to patient
care issues. These items included family members’ participation in care, probability of medication error, and quality
of patient monitoring (Table 2 lists all 15 items addressed
through this set of questions). To investigate physical
environmental characteristics in single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms, 19 questions were asked using a
4-point scale (1=helpful; 4=problematic). Items included
the layout of the room, storage space, and heating and
cooling (Table 3 lists all these items).
3.1. Participants
Participants in this study included both administrative and
nursing staff from three hospitals in the state of Washington,
and one hospital in Oregon. In total, 77 nursing staff
members participated in the study. The hospitals in Wash-
ington were Evergreen Hospital (15 nursing staff), Swedish
hospital, (26 nursing), and University of Washington
Hospital (17 nursing). Providence Hospital participated from
Oregon (19 nursing staff). Table 1 provides demographic
information on the respondents of the study.
3.2. Procedures
Administrators at the four hospitals were contacted for
participation in this study. All four hospitals gave their
consent to participate. One charge nurse of a medical–
surgical nursing unit at each of the four hospitals was
contacted to schedule two sessions at a time when the
maximum number of nursing staff members would be
available for 1-hour periods. One time slot was allotted for
dayshift nurses, and one was allotted for nightshift nurses.
Nurses from both shifts completed their surveys during
these time slots. For the three Seattle area hospitals,
researchers met with three groups of nursing staff at the
three hospitals and were present while the participants filled
out the structured questionnaires. Respondents were told
about the purpose of the study, and the surveys were
completed by the staff members within 30–45 minutes.
Surveys were mailed out to the staff members at the hospital
in Oregon. Upon completion, these surveys were returned to
the researchers by the administrator of that hospital. All
respondents were remunerated with a US$10 Starbucks
gift card.
4. Results
4.1. Comparison of single-occupancy versus double-
occupancy rooms
In comparing single-occupancy versus double-occupancy
rooms, it is evident that nurses clearly favor single-
occupancy rooms, as demonstrated by data in Table 2.7
For instance, 84% of the respondents rated room flexibility
as high or very high in single-occupancy rooms, whereas
only 40% of nurses felt that double-occupancy rooms were
moderately flexible. In terms of flexibility in private rooms,
one respondent stated that, blots of room, private conversa-
tions in person and on phone, stay in room.Q Interaction with
family members and flexibility in accommodating family
members both got high scores (high or very high) in private
rooms, whereas in double-occupancy rooms, interaction
with family members was considered low (33%) or
moderate (47%), and flexibility in accommodating family
members was considered low (48%).
Single-occupancy rooms were chosen as most appropriate
for patient examination (85%) and collection of patient
history (82%). However, fewer than half of the respondents
rated double-occupancy rooms as low in their suitability for
patient examination and collection of patient history. Accord-
ing to one respondent, single rooms are more helpful as there
is bmore privacy, room for ambulation within the room.Q
According to another respondent, bmy opinion is that I am
totally focused on one patient without interruptions [when
noting patient history].Q One respondent stated, bcan’t assure
confidentiality if there’s another patient in the same room.Q
Other factors, such as the quality of patient monitoring,
patient’s comfort level, patient’s recovery rate, and scope for
patient surveillance, were all rated more highly in private
rooms compared to double-occupancy rooms. One respon-
dent stated that b[patient’s recovery rate] could be impacted
by loss of sleep due to noisy/sick roommate.Q On the issue of
surveillance, one respondent stated, b100% focus on one
patient is better than one eye on one patient, another eye on
other patient.Q The study respondents perceived that the
probability of occurrence of medication errors was blowQ in
single-occupancy rooms (43%) and bmoderateQ in double-
occupancy rooms (40%). The respondents stated that the
probability of dietary mix-ups occurring in double-occupan-
cy rooms was bhighQ (34%) to bmoderateQ (36%), whereas in
single-occupancy rooms, it was blowQ (55%) to bvery lowQ
7 Responses do not always total 100%. However, even with the missing
responses, the findings demonstrate that the nursing staff members in all
four hospitals preferred private rooms over multioccupancy rooms.
(25%). Thus, the findings demonstrate that the study par-
ticipants perceived that the probability of medication error
was low in both types of rooms; however, double-occupancy
rooms had a slightly higher probability of dietary mix-ups.
Fifty-seven percent of the respondents stated that the rate
of acquiring a nosocomial infection is either low or very low
in single-occupancy rooms (vs. 10% respondents in case of
double rooms) compared to 11% of respondents stating that
the rate is high or very high in single rooms (vs. 46% stating
the same for double rooms). The incidence of patient falls
was considered moderate in both types of rooms (48%).
Similarly, the rate of taking pain-reducing or sleep-inducing
medicine was considered moderate in both types of room
(37% in single-occupancy rooms and 33% in double-
occupancy rooms).
4.2. Environmental characteristics in single-occupancy and
double-occupancy rooms
The respondents were asked to rate the environmental
characteristics of single-occupancy and double-occupancy
rooms based on their experiences at their present work
setting (see Table 3). The respondents rated many of the
environmental characteristics of single-patient rooms as
helpful. These included the layout of the room (47%), the
availability of space in the room (49%), the arrangement of
furniture (47%), privacy (89%), and space for family
members (51%). Double-occupancy rooms were thought
to be somewhat helpful in terms of being of walking
distance from the nursing station (41%) and the visibility of
patients for monitoring purposes (40%).
The surveillance of patients was considered somewhat
problematic in both single-occupancy (40%) and double-
occupancy rooms (34%). Storage for clean and dirty
supplies was considered somewhat helpful in single-
occupancy rooms (33%), but in double-occupancy rooms,
storage was considered somewhat problematic (59% for
clean supplies and 54% for dirty supplies).
The location of the sink, bathroom, door, and window in
single-occupancy rooms was rated as helpful by a large
majority of respondents (63%, 66%, 67%, and 73%,
respectively). Similarly, in double-occupancy rooms, the
location of the sink, door, and window was considered
somewhat helpful (34%, 41%, and 40%, respectively). The
bathroom location, on the other hand, was thought to be
somewhat problematic (38%).
Data in Table 3 demonstrate that lighting, temperature
control, and noise levels were considered helpful in single-
occupancy rooms, but these features were felt to be somewhat
problematic or to be problematic in double-occupancy rooms.
The data on environmental features in single-occupancy
and double-occupancy rooms demonstrate that single rooms
have more helpful features than multioccupancy rooms.
However, one must keep in mind that the environmental
features of particular patient rooms are tied to room layout,
size, design, and nursing unit layout. Thus, the helpful or
problematic aspects of environmental features may vary
from hospital to hospital. However, these findings indicate
the helpful or problematic aspects of design features in
relation to single-occupancy versus double-occupancy
rooms within a given hospital.
5. Conclusion
This project was a pilot study on nursing staff members’
comparative assessment of patient care issues between
single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms. The find-
ings need to be viewed within the context of the limited
sample size of this pilot study (nursing staff, N = 77). In
comparing single-occupancy versus double-occupancy
rooms, it is evident that the nursing staff clearly favored
single-occupancy rooms. Most of the participants responded
more favorably for single rooms than for double rooms in
the majority of the 15 categories in the comparison
questions. The most noticeable categories of positive
assessment for single rooms include the following: flexibil-
ity in accommodating family, suitability for examination of
patients by health care personnel, patient’s comfort level,
patient’s recovery rate, less probability of medication errors,
and less probability of diet mix-ups.
The respondents rated many environmental character-
istics of single-patient rooms as helpful. These included the
layout of the room (47%), the availability of space in the
room (49%), the arrangement of furniture (47%), privacy
(89%), and space for family members (51%). Double-
occupancy rooms were thought to be somewhat helpful in
terms of being of walking distance from the nursing station
(41%) and the visibility of patients for monitoring purposes
(40%). Surveillance of patients was considered somewhat
problematic in both single-occupancy (40%) and double-
occupancy (34%) rooms.
The primary objectives of this pilot study were to gather an
experience-based assessment from hospital staff members in
regard to single-occupancy versus double-occupancy rooms
and to examine the relevance of the two survey question-
naires. The results generally support the positive aspects of
single rooms from a patient care perspective, as suggested by
the literature. Findings need to be interpreted with the limited
sample size in mind. Future studies need to examine carefully
the implications for operating cost as it relates to associated
patient care issues and room density. An in-depth case study
approach using multiple methods (e.g., systematic observa-
tions, information from data logs, and qualitative interviews)
can provide more useful data in regard to complex relation-
ships among patient care issues, operating cost variables,
patient outcomes, and staff efficiency, as well as subjective
evaluations by patients and family members.
However, the above discussion of hospital costs, infection
control, falls reduction, and therapeutic impacts as they relate
to room occupancy demonstrates that a simple consideration
of room occupancy does not provide a complete picture of
patient care, cost, or infection reduction issues. Room
occupancy issues need to be considered along with other
patient care issues, other environmental changes, or changes
in management policy to bring about desired outcomes.

10.1136/qshc.2006.019422,Safe design of healthcare facilities,2006,,"The physical environment has a significant impact on
health and safety; however, hospitals have not been
designed with the explicit goal of enhancing patient safety
through facility design. In April 2002, St Joseph’s
Community Hospital of West Bend, a member of
SynergyHealth, brought together leaders in healthcare and
systems engineering to develop a set of safety-driven
facility design recommendations and principles that would
guide the design of a new hospital facility focused on
patient safety. By introducing safety-driven innovations into
the facility design process, environmental designers and
healthcare leaders will be able to make significant
contributions to patient safety.
‘‘We shape our buildings and afterwards our
buildings shape us.’’ Winston Churchill,
1941.1
The design of a facility, including its technology
and equipment, creates a physical environment
in which caregivers provide services. Can this
physical environment be designed to improve
patient safety?
Humans err. The reason for the sentinel 1999
Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To err is
human: building a safer health system was just that:
to stress the fact that physicians, caregivers—in
fact the entire human race—all err.2 James
Reason and Lucian Leape’s model of error
contends there are conditions, which cause
interruptions to human neurological systems,
and these lead to human error.3 4 If these
conditions causing human error are minimized
or eliminated in a context such as hospitals, the
result should be less human error, leading to
fewer adverse events and preventable medical
deaths,

patient
outcomes,
and
improved safety.
What are these conditions of human error and
Similarly, in his book The challenge of interior
design, Kleeman states, ‘‘There are those who
assert that essentially the design of an interior
space and its location not only can communicate
with those who enter it but also controls their
behavior.’’6 In The psychology of everyday things,
Norman reports that humans do not always
behave clumsily and do not always err, but are
much more likely to when things they use are
badly conceived and designed.7 And finally,
Moray sums it up well by saying that ‘‘people
of good intention, skilled and experienced, may
none the less be forced to commit errors by the
way in which the design of their environment
calls forth their behavior.’’8
In sum, experts from various fields agree that
the physical environment does have a significant
impact on safety and human performance. The
research done by Reason and Leape testifies to the
value of practices based on principles designed to
compensate for human cognitive failings. When
applied to the healthcare field, these include, for
example, standardization, simplification, and use
of protocols and checklists.4

St
Joseph’s identified the need to develop a set of safety-driven
design principles that could be used by all healthcare
organizations—whether they are building a new facility,
remodeling, or expanding an existing facility.
Internal discussion at St Joseph’s focused on how design of
a new facility could affect patient safety. St Joseph’s
contacted leaders in patient safety, quality improvement,
and human factors to seek their advice. The belief was that
there was an opportunity to learn collectively about how a
facility could be designed to improve patient safety.
In April 2002, leaders in systems engineering, healthcare
administration, health services research, human behavior research, hospital quality improvement and accreditation, hospital architecture, medical education, pharmacy, nursing, and medicine participated in a conference entitled Charting the Course for Patient Safety—A Learning Lab, sponsored in part by a grant from the University of Minnesota, Carlson School Program in Health Administration. These leaders represented organisations such as:
American Hospital Association (AHA)
N American Medical Association (AMA)
N American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA)
N American Society for Quality (ASQ)
N Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)
N Institute for Safe Medication Practice (ISMP)

Derived from the learning lab was the collective belief that safe hospitals could be designed using a process that supports the anticipation, identification, and avoidance of failure; by designing against the latent conditions and active failures which compromise physical and organizational defenses; and, by creating an organizational culture of safety.
Participants in the learning lab were instructed to consider human error, why it occurs, and which factors undermine human performance. A great deal of information has been published on dealing with human error from a systems approach.8 12 13 In a systems approach, error reduction is achieved by strategically building defenses, barriers, and safeguards into the facility, equipment, and processes that make up the system. In order to achieve this, an under- standing of the types of errors present is necessary. Reason classifies errors found in complex systems such as healthcare as either active failures or latent conditions.8 14
In medicine, active failures are errors made by those who provide direct care to the patient such as physicians, nurses, and technicians. Latent conditions are those conditions that are present in the system, the facility, equipment, and processes that contribute to or combine with active failures to produce error. Latent conditions typically arise from decisions made by management, architects, and equipment

designers. Examples of latent conditions present in a
healthcare facility include lack of standardization of equip-
ment and procedures, poor visibility, high noise levels, and
excessive movement of patients. Unlike active failures that
are difficult to predict, latent conditions can be identified and
remedied with safety barriers before they can contribute to an
adverse effect. Safety barriers act to prevent a healthcare
provider from committing an active failure or by mitigating
the effect of an active failure.15
Participants,

recommendations for facility design, safety culture, and
process. The recommendations and principles have been
categorized as either process recommendations (box 1),
safety design principles (box 2), or safety culture (box 3),
and are aimed at minimizing latent conditions, reducing
active failures, and creating a facility design process and
culture focused on patient safety. The safety design principles
specifically address latent conditions and active failures,
while the process recommendations identify critical compo-
nents of the facility design process. The learning lab
participants modified the traditional facility process driven
by the commitment to patient safety (box 4).

TOOLS AND METHODOLOGY TO FOCUS ON
PATIENT SAFETY
Matrix development
The matrix development process was actually developed after
the learning lab, and it was used to brainstorm ideas and
design features to meet the learning lab’s safety design
principles. It was also used to prioritize the potential design
features, technology, and equipment to maximize safety
while maintaining the budgets and capital available. St
Joseph’s modeled the matrix using the quality functional
deployment technique. The quality functional deployment
matrix (house of quality) matches the voice of the customers
to technical requirements.16 In our applications the ‘‘voice of
the customers’’ were the National Learning Lab requirements
for active failures reduction and latent conditions manage-
ment. Other ‘‘voices’’ were meeting the design principles
adopted by the board, and capital cost requirements.
Failure modes and effects analysis at each stage of
design
Few issues about patient safety are raised in the traditional
healthcare facility design process. St Joseph’s has redefined
this process to include the application of failure modes and
effects analysis (FMEA) at each stage.
Faced with no experience in the application of FMEA to
healthcare facility design, we looked to other industries for
expertise and guidance. The American Society of Quality
(ASQ) and an expert in the auto industry provided support
and training to design and architect/construction team
representatives.
The
design
teams
determined
the
traditional
FMEA
approach was too complex for healthcare facility design and
developed a modified approach. They began by simplifying
the FMEA spreadsheet to use a revised severity/occurrence
scoring system. Instead of traditional numerical scoring,
teams were asked to score failure occurrence and effects as
low, medium, or high. This modified process identified
potential failures of design and their relative priority, which
was an important element in making design decisions.
Patients/families involved in the design process
Involving patients and family members is an important
component in the facility design process. At St Joseph’s,
focus groups were held and surveys were conducted at
several points in the design process. Focus group suggestions
on the patient room design led to an important relocation of
the patient chair to allow an unrestricted path to the
bathroom.
Equipment planning beginning on day 1
Most hospitals begin equipment planning late in the design
process. Equipment planning on day 1 ensures that the
equipment technology and facility interfaces are maximized
to meet the safety objectives. At St Joseph’s, technology
options were developed to determine which systems could be
implemented immediately or at the completion of the new
facility, and those that could be acquired in the future.
Priorities included automated systems where possible to
eliminate human error, and decision support and patient
information available at the point of care. Initial technology
plans included centralized scheduling, a nurse call system,
pneumatic
tube
transport,
and
automated
systems
for
pharmacy, rapid admissions, and management of materials.
Mock-up planning beginning on day 1
Many different types of mock-ups exist from two-dimen-
sional to computer generated to physical construction. At St
Joseph’s, two mock-up rooms were physically constructed,
one on the Medical/Surgical floor and the other in the New
Life Center. The rooms went through multiple revisions
including such important features as door sizes, locations of
patient chairs, and lighting sources and locations.
Mock-up rooms can serve two functions in addition to
designing a safer environment: simulation on systems, and
future education and orientations. With a mock-up, simula-
tions can be conducted on redesigned or current processes
such as routine functions, medication delivery to a patient
room, or emergency codes and other complex circumstances.
Design for vulnerable patients
There is a time during each patient’s treatment when they are
at their most vulnerable point. This can occur when they first
come in for treatment and are very sick, or immediately after
treatment such as surgery. During these critical times,
particular attention must be given to identify and minimize
the risks to the patient.
Designing hospital spaces around the common needs of
patient groups may require that rooms look and function
differently but share similar processes and technology. When
making design decisions, the solutions should maximize
safety for the most vulnerable patient. Particular attention
should be paid to movement of patients, transfers, visibility,
and patient room design.
Vulnerable patients should typically have limited move-
ment and exposure to the public. This is a consideration
when making decisions regarding the adjacencies of depart-
ments, location of patient elevators, and ‘‘patient only’’
corridors. In addition, standardized procedures should be
used during movement of patients and transfers to ensure
that complete and accurate patient information accompanies
the patient at all times.



Patient rooms should be designed with maximum visibi-
lity. As described earlier, this can be achieved with cameras,
windows into rooms from charting alcoves (this will allow
visibility without disturbing the patient), and designing
rooms in a mirrored image layout where a nurse can view
four patients from one location in the hallway. Rooms and
bathrooms can be designed larger than a traditional patient
room for ease in movement between bed and bathroom. A
larger room can also include a comfortable space for family
members, which will encourage family involvement and
provide additional patient monitoring.
Additional considerations to minimize risk to vulnerable
patients include standardization of equipment, and the use of
common monitoring systems and intravenous pumps.
Articulate a set of principles for measurement
In order to maintain focus on patient safety, it is important to
have a set of safety-driven design principles to guide the
design process, and to articulate these principles to all
participants involved in the design. In a large building or
remodeling project there are often many participants from
various backgrounds including architects, contractors, hospi-
tal administration and staff, community members, and
industry consultants. Many participants may not understand
the concepts of latent conditions or active failures, nor
appreciate the opportunity to minimize them through facility
design. By having a clearly articulated set of safety-driven
design principles, all participants will share a common focus
and commitment to the design process.
Establish a checklist for current/future design
Developing a checklist of the safety-driven design principles
is an important tool in maintaining focus on patient safety
during the design process. At St Joseph’s, design team
members were responsible for completing a checklist of the
safety design principles, indicating how they addressed each
principle in their proposed design.
UNDERSTANDING AND MINIMIZING LATENT
CONDITIONS AND ACTIVE FAILURES
Noise reduction
A report by the World Health Organization indicates that
noise interferes with communication, creates distractions,
effects cognitive performance and concentration, causes
annoyance, and contributes to stress and fatigue. Mental
activities involving a demand on working memory are
particularly sensitive to noise and can result in degradation
of performance. In a study by Murthy et al, anaesthesia
residents exhibited reduced mental efficiency and poorer
short term memory under the noisy conditions of an
operating room averaging 77 dB.17
In addition to safety considerations, noise affects the
quality of the healing environment for patients. It may
elevate blood pressure, increase pain, alter quality of sleep,
and reduce overall perceived patient satisfaction. Studies in
paediatric intensive care units have shown that noise
routinely disrupts sleep that is necessary for patient comfort
or recovery.18
The nature of sound and its reverberation rate (how long
the sound remains) has a direct effect on the noise level.
When
the
reverberation
rate
is
long
there
is
greater
opportunity for sounds to blend together, increasing the
noise level. With speech communication, a longer reverbera-
tion time combined with background noise makes speech
perception increasingly difficult.
St Joseph’s has many design features to minimize noise.
rooms with insulation between the rooms, more absorbent
ceiling tile, and ‘‘quiet’’ equipment and technology.
Scalability, adaptability, flexibility
Scalability is the ability to expand or remodel easily so that
latent errors are not designed into the building expansion.
Adaptability is the ability to adapt space for different or
evolving services so that latent errors are not built in.
Many design and construction concepts can be applied to
achieve a scalable or adaptable healthcare facility—every-
thing from open spaces with modular systems, to infra-
structure requirements, and expansion zones that support
scalable and adaptable buildings. Specific examples that St
Joseph’s has incorporated into the facility design include:
ceiling heights (floor to floor) to allow for expansion or
changes, and wiring or wireless technology that will allow
future technology to be easily implemented. Key services
located on outside walls allow for expansion sizing of patient
rooms and provide greater adaptability.
Visibility of patients to staff
Visibility of patients to staff is an important issue regarding
patient safety and quality in the healthcare setting. There is
little debate that healthcare organizations trail their peers in
service innovation. In the 19th century, it was said that form
follows function. In the 21st century, it is becoming clear that
form shapes function. A well chosen form helps providers
deliver
services
more
efficiently
and
cheaply.19
A
pod
structure allowing close proximity to their patients allows
nurses to deliver improved quality, while enabling them to be
more efficient and effective.
Unit designs must allow caregivers to be visual in
proximity to the patients under their care as well as
accommodate the more traditional orientations of broader
based patient responsibility. This can be accomplished by
designing multiple mini-nursing stations throughout the
unit, offering alcoves for charting and dictation and allowing
for wall desks, whether in corridors or patient rooms. In
addition, visibility can be enhanced through patient rooms
designed in a mirrored image layout, with adjoining charting
alcoves, cameras in rooms, windows in the charting alcoves,
and convenient locations of supplies.
Patients involved with care
According to the IOM report, Crossing the quality chasm, many
patients have expressed frustration with their inability to
participate in decision making, to obtain information they
need, to be heard, and to participate in systems of care that
are responsive to their needs.20
Gerteis et al have identified several dimensions of patient-
centered care: (1) respect for patients’ values, preferences,
and expressed needs; (2) coordination and integration of
care; (3) information, communication, and education; (4)
physical comfort; (5) emotional support—relieving fear and
anxiety; and (6) involvement of family and friends.20 Many of
these dimensions have facility implications, including those
of equipment and technology.
In addition, during a hospital stay, keeping patients and
family members informed can also potentially reduce errors
or potential errors. For example, patients or their family
members should receive a daily schedule of prescribed
medication and treatments. They should be encouraged to
verify this information with the caregivers administering the
medication or treatment. In addition, providing a comfor-
table space for family members to stay in the patient’s room
also facilitates their involvement with care.
Examples are: no overhead paging, quiet floor coverings
(carpet, rubber), ‘‘quiet’’ HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning) systems, private rooms, private standardized
Standardization
Care standardization could substantially impact the basic
consequences of organizational factors, enough to reduce
medical errors and improve quality. Errors, like human
failures in any other sphere, are not just isolated causes; they
are themselves the consequences of upstream organizational
factors or latent conditions.3
Facility
impact
on
behavior
is
a
documented
and
researched relationship in several areas, including commercial aviation and information and communications technology; however very little is known about facility impact on
standardization and how it affects the medical error rates and
quality of care.
Much of the work in human factors focuses on improving
the human/system interface by designing better systems and
processes. This includes standardization of patient rooms,
treatment areas, equipment, and procedures. The standardization of the facility and room design, from the location of
the outlets, to the bed controls, to which cupboard the latex
gloves are stored, the charting process, even switches on light
fixtures—down to the most minute detail—all have an
impact on behavior.
In The psychology of everyday things, Norman talks about
design novelty, stating, ‘‘Users don’t want each new design to
use a different method for a task. Users need standardization.’’7 Specific examples to consider in facility standardization are:
N Truly standardized patient rooms
N Ambulatory care rooms
N Gases and equipment
N ‘‘Migrating’’ toward standardized IVs, beds, and monitors
N Medication systems and other care processes.
Automate where possible
In Crossing the quality chasm: a new health system for the 21st
century,20 the IOM identifies information technology (IT)
solutions as a necessary component to improving patient
safety.
The
IOM
challenges
the
government
and
the
healthcare industry to make a commitment to develop an
information infrastructure to support healthcare delivery that
would lead to the elimination of most handwritten data by
the end of the decade.
When designing a new healthcare facility, technology
planning should begin early in the design process. If possible,
ongoing assessment of the type and frequency of errors
within the existing institution will assist in determining
specific technological needs and setting priorities. To facilitate the decision process, it is beneficial to create a list of
those IT systems needed and/or desired and to characterize
those systems according to their relationship to one another,
impact on patient safety, financial investment, implementation time, and their impact on facility design and operation.
The financial investment should reflect the total cost of
ownership, including costs for purchase, implementation,
maintenance, and staff support.
Minimize fatigue
Research has identified fatigue as a possible contributing
factor of human error.15 Although research has not proven
the effects of fatigue on patient safety, studies have shown
that fatigue has a negative impact on alertness, mood, and
psychomotor and cognitive performance; all of which can
have an impact on patient safety.21–23 Studies of surgical
residents suggest that manual dexterity and fine motor skills
may be compromised as a result of sleep deprivation.24
Shift work and, in certain circumstances, long hours and
increased workloads are inevitable in patient care. As a result,
minimizing fatigue is a complex issue in hospitals that
requires a comprehensive approach. In facility design, this
could mean minimizing the distances staff must travel
between patient rooms, nurses’ stations, and treatment
areas. This could affect not only the number of patient
rooms per floor but also vertical and horizontal adjacencies of
departments.
The
use
of
technology
can
increase
the
efficiency of workload and reduce the reliance on short term
memory
and
thought
processes.
One
example
is
the
computerized tube transport system that can either eliminate
or significantly reduce the need for staff to hand deliver
laboratory specimens, blood products, or medical supplies,
thus increasing efficiency of workloads.25 Noise reduction, as
previously recommended, is another method of minimizing
fatigue in both hospital staff and patients. Additional
recommended strategies from the literature include limiting
work hours and on-call periods, using forward rotation of
shift work (morning to evening to night shifts), developing
workstation environments that minimize distractions from
patient care, alertness strategies such as napping and
caffeine, and education of physicians and staff about the
negative effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue and the
importance of good sleep habits.22–24
Immediate accessibility of information at the point of
service
In order to provide patients with the most accurate diagnosis
and treatment possible, physicians need to have complete,
‘‘real-time’’ information about the patient, suspected illness,
and treatment options. Research has shown that lack of
knowledge
and
information
can
lead
to errors.14
Two
significant causes of adverse drug events (ADEs) and
potential ADEs are lack of drug knowledge and inadequate
availability of patient information.26
Technologies have been developed that can assist physicians and other caregivers with complex cognitive tasks such
diagnosis and treatment by providing ‘‘real-time’’ medical
information.27 Examples of these technologies include the
internet, computer-based patient records, and clinical deci-
sion support systems.
In addition to technological solutions, other methods for
improving the visibility of patient information can be used.
Charting alcoves directly adjacent to patient rooms can
provide easy access to patient charts without disrupting the
patient. In surgery, operating rooms can be equipped with
large boards or monitors displaying patient information and
scheduled procedures that can be verified against physician
instructions and the patient’s chart and medical records.
Minimizing patient transfers/handoffs
Participants at the National Learning Lab discussed this issue
from a variety of perspectives. Transferring patients puts both
patient and staff in a vulnerable position in which patients or
staff could be harmed, and causes disruption for ill patients.
Usually a transfer from a patient room involves multiple
transfers. A patient is transferred to surgery or to radiology,
transferred to a table in those locations, and usually returns
to be transferred to the patient bed again.
Often, these transfers involve handoffs: nurse to transporter to radiology tech to transporter to nurse, creating the
potential for error or harm. Many other handoffs occur in a
facility involving many caregivers, such as physician to nurse
to nurse to radiology tech to lab techs, and so on, in high risk
circumstances. These conditions are ripe for error.
Minimizing patient transfers/handoffs, or minimizing the
risk of harm when transferring patients, have many facility
design implications. It is safer to design services to come to
the patient, not the reverse. This design needs to be adaptable
so services in the future can come to the patient. Potential
errors due to transfers and handoffs can be minimized by
having lifts in every care area in the hospital, barcoding for
patient identification, and electronic medical records, so that
‘‘non-traditional’’ areas where medication may be dis-
pensed or delivered; technology applications such as
pharmacy decision support, barcoding, computerized
physician order entry (CPOE), or electronic medical
records (EMR) should be integrated with ‘‘appliances’’
such as IV pumps.

N Patient falls. Develop bed exit technology to notify

N MRI hazards. Create a three-zone MRI suite; use a
duplicated checklist; use hand-held metal detectors at
point of entry; colour code any MRI compatible equip-
ment; consider computer chip technology.
Using the recommended tools and methodology focusing
on patient safety, St Joseph’s patient room demonstrates
minimising latent conditions and active failures through
application of the safety design principles and designing
around precarious events. The design of the patient room,
coupled with technology and equipment recommendations,
will institute changes in nursing and physician processes and
workflow to increase patient safety. The ‘‘truly’’ standardized
patient room reflects the following safety design features
aimed at creating a safe, high quality, patient-centered
environment:
Charting alcove with window to increase patient visibility
complete and accurate information is available for caregivers
at the point of service where handoffs occur.
Designing around precarious events
The precarious events (active failures) should be based on a
healthcare institution’s own database of sentinel events,
adverse events, medical errors and near misses; and then on
national databases such as those from the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) and the
Veterans Administration National Patient Safety Center.
According to JCAHO, a sentinel event is an unexpected
occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof.28 Such events are called
‘‘sentinel’’ because they signal the need for immediate
investigation and response. According to the IOM, an adverse
event is defined as an injury caused by medical management
rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the
patient. A medical error is defined as the failure of a planned
action to be completed as intended (error of execution) or the
use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (error of planning).2 A
near miss is defined as an error that does not result in harm to
the patient.

CONCLUSION
The 2002 National Learning Lab has had a powerful effect on
St Joseph’s and is influencing other hospital facility devel-
opment, both nationally and internationally. St Joseph’s fully
implemented the recommendations of the National Learning
Lab, modifying the traditional design process, designing
around latent conditions and active failures, and enhancing
the facility.

St Joseph’s has also received an AHRQ Grant to assist in
the implementation of our major technology platform, Epic,
and to assess the impact of the new institution on safety and
quality. Studies have been completed on the original St
Joseph’s and those same studies will be conducted in 2007 to
assess the differences the new facility with its technology and
equipment has on latent conditions, active failures, length of
stay,
patient
satisfaction,
safety
culture,
and

discharge.
The new hospital opened in August of 2005. The planning
of the move under the direction of the VP of Patient Care
Services, Mike Murphy, evolved over a year’s time, using the
tools we used in designing the hospital; FMEA, time outs,
standard processes, etc. The outcome was a smooth, incident-
free move. Staff simulated caring for patients for about two
months before opening, and oriented themselves to the new
facility. A SWAT team was formed for the first few weeks to
assist staff in addressing concerns after the opening. This
group of employees representing technology services, materi-
als services, clinic services, etc, were available 24 hours a day
to support the needs of transitioning employees.
The facility opened on time and under budget. In fact, St
Joseph’s was able to add significant programs and enhance
its safety features as a result of being under budget. The
timing of the project allowed us to receive competitive bids
with the high level of standardization. For example, cost
concerns were expressed about fully standardized patient
rooms compared to back-to-back patient rooms. The con-
tractors actually felt fully standardized was at least the same,
if not less, cost than back-to-back patient rooms.
Opening a new hospital is a dramatic transaction for an
organization. New technologies coupled with persuasive
process modifications create significant change behavior. As
much as we tested the technologies and processes, we still
discovered issues around both. The simulations and orienta-
tions were very helpful but additional orientation and
technology testing would have been useful.
We have had an opportunity to conduct tours for many
organizations around the opening of the new hospital and
after the opening. The effects of the design around latent
conditions (box 2) is apparent. Quiet environment, improved
air flow, standardization, etc, all exhibit the commitment St
Joseph’s had to safety by design. Staff from all areas have
expressed their pride for influencing the design so they can
provide safe care. It was truly a transforming experience to
have been able to participate in the design of St Joseph’s.
Architects, mechanical engineers, mechanical architects,
general contractors, nurses, administration, board members,
physicians all expressed their personal transformation at a
recent National Learning Lab celebration. We changed our
building and afterwards, our building changed us.
