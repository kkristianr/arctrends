# Text-based Trend Analysis Tool

This tool helps domain experts analyze temporal shifts in healthcare architectural design priorities using text-based trend analysis. It uses vector space models to uncover trends across decades. Key features include **CADE alignment** for comparable vector spaces [^1][^2], **interactive visualizations** (cosine similarity and PPMI graphs), and **flexible preprocessing options** for tailored analysis. The tool combines quantitative methods with qualitative insights for a comprehensive understanding of trends.
