      "There is widespread concern about the increase in intrapartum intervention rates, e.g. caesarean sections, and recent research and discussions have focused on the need for the appropriate use of medically indicated interventions (Miller et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2016).

In this article, the authors define intrapartum interventions as all interventions occurring from the onset of labor up to and including the expulsion of the placenta and membranes. Intrapartum interventions include, but are not limited to, the induction of labor, the use of intravenous oxytocin, artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes, epidural anesthesia, electronic fetal health rate monitoring, episiotomy, caesarean section.

      "There are well-recognized benefits for both mother and baby when the woman receives sup\u0002port from a chosen birth companion as reflected in Cochrane reviews (Bohren et al., 2017; Hod\u0002nett et al., 2013) and by the World Health Orga\u0002nization (WHO, 2020), yet we claim a dichotomy in current birth environment design exists which does not reflect this knowledge. While in most resource-rich nations, a continuous supporter is expected to accompany the woman throughout her labor and birth experience, the supporter is usually not well accommodated in the birth space (Johansson et al., 2015, Minnie et al., 2018) and subsequently may be unable to function effec\u0002tively in their support role. In their role, supporters often feel over\u0002whelmed, anxious, or uncertain (Gawlik et al., 2015). Although recent design guidelines show an awareness of supporters’ importance, it appears supporters have been overlooked when it comes to birth environment design (Harte et al., 2016). Although recent design guidelines show an awareness of supporters’ importance, it appears supporters have been overlooked when it comes to birth environment design (Harte et al., 2016). Hospital culture, sociocultural and material/ technological context are interwoven influences (Maffi, 2016) affecting this claim. Healthcare settings are inherently complex spaces that provide endless challenges for designers to accommodate all necessary delivery of care components (van Hoof et al., 2015). Within architectural and design practice, the demand for efficient execution of each commission allows few opportunities for user-based research (Andrade et al., 2012); therefore, it is important that rigorous research findings are regularly incorporated into design practice. Design assessment tools, akin to guidelines, are both embraced and resisted by practitioners who dislike the prescriptive “checklist” approach while also needing to incorporate the latest best-practice evidence-based design knowledge into their project within the budgeted time frame (Brambilla et al., 2019; Moore et al., 2015). This tension of bringing evidence into practice is an ongoing effort and opportunity for improvement on the part of environment design behavior researchers, as well as for many other design and architectural fields (Forsythe, 2018). We join others to claim evidence-based design is a key design process for childbirth environment design, especially for patient comfort and reduc\u0002ing stress (Brambilla et al., 2019; O’Callaghan et al., 2019). Aim The aim of this comparative case study is two\u0002fold: (1) to present research-informed design prin\u0002ciples developed from the video-ethnographic Childbirth Supporter Study (CSS; Harte et al., 2016) and based on the comparison of these results (2) to discuss and suggest refinements to the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET version October 2, 2010), the leading assessment tool for physical birth environments to better reflect the needs of childbirth supporters in hospi\u0002tal contexts. The Study Case Setting and Context The research presented here is a comparative case study, which will be explained further in the Method section. The two cases compared are the CSS (Harte et al., 2016) and the BUDSET (version October 2, 2010; Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al., 2011). The CSS is an empirical study conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation (Harte, 2015), while the BUDSET is both a conceptual and empirical pilot research Harte et al. 149 study (Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al., 2011). Both CSS and BUDSET occurred in Aus\u0002tralia between 2011 and 2016, while the com\u0002parative case study research presented here, which is both empirical and theoretical, occurred between 2015 and 2022. We draw on research into the experiences of childbirth supporters from the CSS (Harte et al., 2016) to initiate discussion around the inclusion of supporter needs in birth environment design. We use the BUDSET as a second case to compare the CSS results to, as a technique for improving the BUDSET, with the goal of facilitating improved experiences for childbirth supporters. We refer to Version 2.0 developed in 2010 throughout this article. For an abbreviated BUD\u0002SET, see Table S1 in the Online Supplements. To lay the groundwork for the comparative case study, we first provide a brief background of childbirth supporters in the designed birth space, the theoretical framework and the methods used for the CSS, and an overview of the BUD\u0002SET before turning our attention to the compara\u0002tive case study. Supporters in the Designed Birth Environment Supporters, for this research, are defined as untrained companions from the woman’s per\u0002sonal network (Harte, 2015). Professional sup\u0002porters may also benefit from the results presented here, however; they are not the focus. Birth supporter’s roles include many activities, including physical comfort and touch (for instance, massage, wiping the woman’s forehead, holding her hand, providing ice chips/water; Johansson et al., 2012). Psychological and affec\u0002tive support (both overt and covert) are equally important, including verbal encouragement, eye contact, and active listening and positive response to expressions of pain or fear the woman may convey (Johansson et al., 2012). The softer aspects of care can be facilitated with reimagined birth spaces harmoniously rich with sensory, color, and light/dark patterns that foster a supportive atmosphere (Balabanoff, 2017). A range of accommodation types enable the supporter to regulate their participation type and level, with confidence in assisting at the birth, as shown in the scoping review of eight crucial building spaces in maternity care (Setola et al., 2019). Theoretical Frameworks As this comparative case study is centered on the CSS as a central axis, or case, the following briefly describes the CSS theoretical framework and analysis technique. The theoretical underpin\u0002nings, methods and research design for CSS are described in detail in related publications (Harte et al., 2017; Harte et al., 2014). The CSS com\u0002prises ethnography (as both a research collection technique and as a theory), “birth territory” the\u0002ory (Fahy et al., 2008; Fahy & Parratt, 2006), and the “safe, satisfying birth” hypothesis (Foureur, Davis, et al., 2010) to support the data collection method, while symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1986; Prus, 1996) and a thematic coding approach informed by both Saldan˜a (2013) and the activities, environment, interactions, objects and users (AEIOU) framework originally devel\u0002oped by Wasson (2000) guided the data interpretation. The above-described theoretical framework grounds the CSS and supports the process for the comparative case study, while the comparative case study adopts the additional theoretical framework of critical theory. Broadening the view of each case to include the phenomena in question—how better to support childbirth sup\u0002porters in the design environment—the compara\u0002tive case study attends to power and inequality, informed by Marxist, feminist, and critical race theory (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017). Questioning the evidence with a “meaning-making,” theoretical stance is a hallmark for the comparative case study approach, as it facilitates both an unbounded frame and active iteration to progress the complex field of birth environment design. Case 1: The Childbirth Supporter Study This and the following section describe the cases compared. The first case is the CSS and the second case is the BUDSET. The CSS is a 150 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1) video-ethnographic case study of one family’s experience. This included eight participants (one woman, her partner and three family supporters, plus three midwives), 1-hr of video footage from 15 hr of labor, observational field notes, and five postnatal video-cued interviews. CSS is a sub\u0002study of the larger birth unit design (BUD) study conducted in hospital birth units in Australia between 2011 and 2015. Both studies received ethical approval (HREC/10/HAWKE/135 and SSA/10/SG/190). The CSS study was a focused, short-term eth\u0002nographic study that used thick description to provide sufficient evidence and context for the “reader to evaluate the extent and truth of the phenomenon under investigation and how it may resonate with other environments, circumstances, and people (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)” (Harte et al., 2016). Video-ethnography is an ethnographic tech\u0002nique that uses video of the participants engaged in the experience in question to observe complex lived experiences (“the data”), which then enables deeper reflection on the part of the parti\u0002cipants and the researchers. In the CSS study, the video-reflexive ethnographic data collection con\u0002sisted of unobtrusive labor recording, followed by postpartum interviews conducted while viewing the footage, to explore the participants’ experi\u0002ences and the meanings they attribute to their experiences in the designed space. The partici\u0002pants were invited to view the video, being aware of the researcher’s intention to activate a reflex\u0002ive process. In the CSS study, reflexivity was practiced in two shared but different ways by the researcher and by the participants. Reflexivity is a process of stepping back from the data to view it with a personal recognition as to one’s place in the experience to enable the data to be interpreted in a systematic and layered way (Darawsheh, 2014; Palaganas et al., 2017). The researcher practiced a reflexive stance with an aim to gain honest and open assessment of multiple aspects, for instance, their personal station and values, while the participants were also invited to prac\u0002tice a reflexive stance in the act of watching the video—to interpret their actions based on multiple aspects, for instance, their memories and feelings as well as novel observations. All CSS study participant names are pseudo\u0002nyms. Felicity, the woman in labor, aimed for a natural, unmedicated labor. Felicity’s mother, Frances, acted as her main supporter for most of the labor. Although Frances acted as Felicity’s main supporter, Felicity’s partner, Martin, was available as needed to provide support. Felicity’s two sisters also occupied the birth environment and provided support in varying (lesser) degrees. Three midwives present at various points of the labor provided contextual evidence to facilitate ethnographic understanding. Three themes were identified in the CSS analysis: an “unbelonging paradox,” “role navigation,” and “supporting the supporter” (Harte et al., 2016). Eight subthemes characterize these three themes as seen in Harte et al. (2016). Design characteristics to facilitate optimal BUD have previously been proposed in the BUDSET (Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010; Foureur et al., 2011; Sheehy et al., 2011). We will now provide further contextual background for BUDSET. Case 2: BUDSET An important research component that supported the development of the CSS was the presence of a physical birth spatial design audit tool, the BUD\u0002SET. The original BUDSET tool serves as the second case for this comparative case study report. Upon completion by birth unit caregivers, staff, designers, or related people, the BUDSET enables a valid and reliable audit of physical childbirth environments in terms of the quality of the built spaces, including the objects within them, specifically from the perspective of a target group of women’s experiences. It may clarify the relationship between BUD\u0002SET and the CSS findings to picture the entire birthing journey as both a series of physical movements through physical space, as well as a psychological journey outside of space (and time) for the woman and her supporter(s). Optimally, the woman and her chosen supporter synergize as a cooperative dyad. The BUDSET has four domains, which serve to assess design factors contributing to the “fear Harte et al. 151 cascade” cycle (Stenglin & Foureur, 2013), including the attributes of “facility,” “aesthetics” of the space, and “support” for family and friends (Foureur, Leap, et al., 2010). These domains are comprised of 18 characteristics—the design principles. Results of a pilot test indicate that the BUD\u0002SET is a viable tool for “assess[ing] the optimal\u0002ity of birth units... [and to] determine which domain areas may need improvement” (Foureur et al., 2011, p. 36). Other studies confirm content validity for the original target group of women, while proposing the opportunity for refinements to better reflect the experiences of diverse groups, midwives, and supporters (Menke et al., 2018; Sheehy et al., 2011). Comparative Case Study Methods The research presented here uses the comparative case study approach (Bartlett & Vavrus, 2017), an empirical approach to making extended meaning of two or more cases. We present, framed with theory, the relationship of the CSS findings as compared with the BUDSET design recommen\u0002dations. Similarly, the BUDSET is compared to the CSS to demonstrate the relevance, applicabil\u0002ity, and validity of the CSS study. The strength of the comparative case study method is the ability for the researcher to attend to simultaneous and overlapping axes, as described by Bartlett and Vavrus (2017). Specif\u0002ically, the “horizontal, which compares how simi\u0002lar ... phenomena unfold in locations that are connected and socially produced; vertical, which traces phenomena across scales; and transversal, which traces phenomena and cases across time” (p. 15). It is important to understand the need for context to not be solely defined “as place or loca\u0002tion, but ...should rather be conceptualized as something spatial and relational” (p. 15). Additionally, the comparative case study method “eschew(s) a static, bounded notion of culture in favor of a view of culture as an on-going, contested production” (Bartlett and Vavrus, 2017, p. 15). This method supports the extension of an existing spatial evaluation tool via comparative superimposition of ethnographic results. The comparative case study method as promoted by Bartlett and Vavrus works in an iterative way to trace relevant and contingent actors, both human and nonhuman, to achieve “a sense of shared place, purpose, or identity with regard to the central phenomenon” (p. 10), which in our case is the support of childbirth supporters in the designed environment. Analysis Process As there are important design practice sugges\u0002tions (also called design imperatives) revealed by the CSS, so too design imperatives are also included as the spine of the BUDSET. The com\u0002parative case study approach was conducted using a line-by-line comparison of all CSS find\u0002ings, as reported in Harte et al. (2016), overlayed directly to each BUDSET characteristics. The aim was to authenticate fit, utility, validity, relia\u0002bility, rigor, and trustworthiness for both cases (Miles et al., 2018), as meaningful to design scho\u0002lars, childbirth design evidence-creation, and design practitioners. Because BUDSET was developed prior to the CSS study, there is a gap we argue should be addressed, to strengthen BUDSET by more com\u0002pletely including the needs of childbirth support\u0002er(s). The BUDSET characteristics are evident in the CSS findings, as the CSS findings also demonstrate the relevance of the BUDSET char\u0002acteristics. Each component of each data set (BUDSET and CSS) was taken in turn and com\u0002pared to each of the other set of components by the first author and later verified as accurate by the coauthors. Narrative examples of this process follow in the Findings section. The complete comparative case study is pre\u0002sented in Table S2 as a online supplementary file, as a technique to demonstrate the iterative sug\u0002gestions to better include supporters within the existing BUDSET, Version 2.0. All 18 BUDSET domains are stated, followed by CSS findings to highlight supporters’ needs within the design as related to the BUDSET characteristic. The degree to which the BUDSET characteristics are reflected within the CSS study are indicated as either strong, mixed, or limited to the degree in which the listed items were relevant and matched to the CSS participants’ experience, either as 152 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1) example or as counter example. For instance, if the ability to adjust lights is a BUDSET charac\u0002teristic, and this ability was absent but desired by the CSS participants, it is listed as mixed. The analysis highlights BUDSET aspects that account for supporters, and areas where the CSS suggests a need for development of supporters’ design-related needs. First, we provide contextual information about BUDSET, followed by two examples of how design elements participated in the childbirth supporters’ experiences. BUDSET Domains Related to Supporters One further proviso, before describing examples, is that a person’s perception of their experiences is true for them, while—in the case of support\u0002er’s—this self-perception may not transfer into the most optimal behavior to facilitate labor. This article aims to provide context for suggested future and more nuanced research. A further research question that could be posed is, do design features play a mediating role, or do they have a moderating role in clarifying supporters’ self-perceptions of their activities—while also improving the actual supporter role? As reported in the CSS (Harte et al., 2016), supporters have two parallel sets of needs: (1) to provide support for the woman and (2) (to have assistance in) managing the physical and emotional demands of their role. Implicated within these two roles, which we call “engaged” and “waiting,” although neither term is exclusive, are both sets of supporter’s needs: to support the woman and to be supported in attending to their own well-being. As reported in the CSS (Harte et al., 2016), supporters have two parallel sets of needs: (1) to provide support for the woman and (2) (to have assistance in) managing the physical and emotional demands of their role. With a finer grained comparative case lens, we now examine BUDSET as reflected in the CSS findings while the CSS findings are simultane\u0002ously assessed as reflected in the BUDSET char\u0002acteristics. A few examples are identified to demonstrate this relationship, with design imperatives identified     The number of People with Dementia (PwD) is rising worldwide. World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1). Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2). This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,   learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD. It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented       as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5). In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6). The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,    and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7). Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns. There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,        Figure 1. The comparison of the bed numbers of LTC between 2010 and 2020 (Eurostat).       that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14). Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related. In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).  1.1\tResearch gap  In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research. There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have. The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of    fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).  2.\tMaterials and methods  This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research. The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users. A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy. The survey consists of:  1.\tidentification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development) 2.\tchoice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition) 3.\tprocessing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)  The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare       facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.  2.1\tAssessment framework development from the case study analysis  The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing - thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).  2.2\tWeb-based survey definition  The survey was divided into 4 parts:  1.\tThe first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only. 2.\tThe second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.    3.\tThe third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question. Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD. The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development: -\tlocation, -\tshared spaces, -\tpaths, -\tliving areas, -\texternal spaces, -\ttechnologies, -\tbedrooms. 4.\tIn the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.  2.3. Data collection and analysis  The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible. The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...). It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer. The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.  3.\tResults  The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.       Figure 2. Analysis table for case studies.       The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid. The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined. This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces. Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.    3.1.\tSection 1 – Statistical data  The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).  Figure 3. The age of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.   Figure 4. The gender distribution of the people who were involved in the questionnaire        Figure 5. The position of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.     Figure 6. The questionnaire results about the location of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.      3.2.\tLocation  The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).   3.3.\tGeneral aspects  As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about 10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development. However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.        Figure 7. The questionnaire results about the general idea about the structure of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     3.4.\tDistribution  56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8). It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.   3.5.\tLiving area  The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9). Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,        Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.    Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.  3.6.\tOutdoor space  The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,   such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.  3.7.\tFuture trends  Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a        Figure 11. The opinion about the future of healthcare facilities.    Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.    prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11). This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.   3.8.\tPersonalization  The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners. In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a       viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.  3.9.\tOther considerations  The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire. These can be divided into three main themes:  A)\tIssues related to the content: -\tI believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff; -\tIn general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process; -\tSingle room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside; -\tI believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”; -\tA facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration; -\tFundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important    to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife; - I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community; B)\tIssues related to the form and process of the survey: -\tEnhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions; -\tSuggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities; C)\tIssues related to staff training and education: -\tAll staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself ); -\tTrained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces; -\tIt is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and       chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.  3.10.\tComparison of the results  The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses. Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,    favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).  4.\tDiscussion and conclusion  The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with          Figure 13. The comparison between the results from the Case studies and Questionnaire.       the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed. The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.  5.\tResearch limitations and future developments  The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage    and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents. However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

With a focus on sustainable development, the goals and desired beneficial outcomes of asset rehabilitation are examined as a challenging process. Instead of building new cities, sustainable development aims to reclaim abandoned land. Buildings and the entire infrastructure are being renovated as a result of his growth, making the area more desirable as a location for investment or habitation [1, 2]. An urban heritage city core can be found at the heart of many cities all over the world. In addition to offering their communities significant social, cultural, and economic benefits, they provide them with an exceptional sense of place and identity. Urban sprawl, population growth, and other issues that could lead to the neglect or even destruction of historic sites and buildings, unfortunately, frequently cause serious issues in these areas. In order to ensure sustainable development for future generations while preserving our common cultural heritage, urban heritage city centre must be revitalized. A thorough strategy that involving numerous stakeholders is necessary to accomplish this. Many cities struggle to       finance significant projects due to limited resources and finances. Due to competing interests among various stakeholders, such initiatives frequently face a lack of political will or public support. Figure 1 show, that the greatest appreciation of heritage values improves all three dimensions of this interdisciplinary approach, enhancing quality of life in accordance with current requirements (synchronic). The conservation of growth plans for standard of living (syn-diachronic) and the realization of these historical values by future gene- rations (diachronic). In all three directions, this is accurate. Multimodal analysis may have a negative impact on the cultural of protected old urban sections or Heritage sites, leading to an overabundance of tourist attractions, employment losses, and a reduction in picture quality. Less intergenerational responsibility and little community participation will result from this. Unsustainable heritage management has an impact on the historic modal, which will eventually be destroyed in a proactive manner. It will also be negatively im- pacted by the loss of scientific knowledge, the sense of an unfriendly environment, environmental contami- nation, and the ineffective utilization of land and structures. Furthermore, restoring historical structures can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Despite these challenges, revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city cores is critical for achieving sustainable    Figure 1. Integrated approach of sustainable development of heritage sites [10].   development in communities. This not only helps to preserve the shared cultural heritage, but it also has economic benefits: by investing in historic building restoration, we create jobs and attract new businesses, which can increase tax revenues for local govern- ments. Additionally, preserving historic sites gives locals special places to explore and enjoy while fostering a sense of community pride. Urban redevelopment is initially defined by Roberts [3] as a complete and integrated vision that solves urban issues and aims to enhance the economic, social, and environmental circumstances of a place that has undergone trans- formation. The components of sustainable development could be classified to environmental, economic, and social; they contend that in reality, each component of sustainability is handled by a number of redevelop- ment objectives [4]. Furthermore, sustainability evaluations should make allowance for interdependencies, economic, environmental, and social challenges, along with the long-term effects of current actions [5]. However, because of a number of issues and the participation of several parties, redevelopment is highly complicated. It is a complex task, thus it is essential that dangers and difficulties are recognized right away. When an old structure reaches the end of its useful life, it needs to be renovated. Over time there is appreciation in land and depreciation in building structure while providing an example of determining the best moment for renovation [6]. Once the value of the land exceeds the worth of the structure, it is much more acceptable to redevelop the building. This view is supported by the fact that the majority of the structures in Hilla’s historic district actually exist. Older buildings in Hilla’s city center have a lifespan of 40 to 150 years (Figure 2), but land value with existing development limitation laws is significantly more than the present worth of those buildings and their use. Numerous buildings in the city’s historic district undergo renovations regardless of their age or longevity. Sustainable urban redeve      lopment, which also acts as a policy agenda to improve social, environmental, and economic conditions, reduces the adverse effects of urban expansion [5]. The historic district of Hilla is expanding quickly. By increasing the value of the land, urban redevelopment activities, infrastructural growth, and rising land and construc- tion demand all support the gentrification tendency. Hilla’s heritage city centre is unique due to the fact that it is not very old and experiencing fast transformation. Hilla’s considerable past as well as its quick transition helps to establish its perception as a dynamic, energetic city with deeply embedded heritage values. Rapid progress does, however, entail consequences. One the one hand, Hilla centre is valued for its historical relevance and heritage values by businesspeople, visitors, and urban planners. On the other hand, it is apparent that despite the city’s fast expansion and the requirement for urban renewal, Hilla historical assets and distinguishing traits must be preserved. This paper purposes to demonstrate how, Hilla urban growth and constructed heritage pre- servation may coexist and cooperate to assist one another. Also, it will demonstrate how historical values’ economic potential might aid urban development. Heri- tage values might be fabricated or even built from  Figure 2. Heritage and old part of City of Hilla.   scratch in order to promote urban growth. Despite the fact that Iraq possesses several historical cities with worldwide historical significance, the Hilla is in the frontline of conservation. This kind of strategy may promote participation and awareness among stake- holders, communities, and decision-makers. Through sustainable urban redevelopment, which also helps developers and planners solve significant environmen- tal concerns, the idea of sustainability is being spread among architects, planners, and developers [4]. Sustai- nable development has been cited as requiring the preservation of cultural heritage. The utilizing the city’s history necessitates that the entire city and surrounding area be maintained in top condition, and not just each individual structure [7]. In order to achieve a balance between the past and present of significant urban areas, adjustments should be made to a city’s tangible and intangible aspects as part of the larger goal of historical conservation. As a case study, urban and building rehabilitation plans have not yet been significantly influenced by sustainability. Recent research has been done to improve the connection between sustainability and building or urban rehabilitation in worldwide practices. The rationale for conducting this study, As we have seen from the literature review, there is a real need to develop a new methodology. This methodology is essential for the formulation and selection of indicators to assess sustainability, with a composite framework approach [8]. The contribution of the study to the existing literature is the proposed approach offers a considerable advance in how heritage is appraised in connection to the overall objectives of urban sustainability. The finding of common indicators between urban development and heritage conservation may assist in anticipating issues, identifying priorities, and giving baseline knowledge to support more and better sustainable practices in urban redevelopment [9]. The conflict of forces to transform the city centre and its historical assets needs new strategies empha      sizing the necessity of sustainable development in the old city centre. In other words, it must evaluate the current city centre, its historical relevance and values, as well as its application for the redevelopment purposes.  Research Question The research question was developed to explore how to apply the redevelopment model inside urban historic sites as a step toward sustainability. The primary idea is that revitalizing and protecting urban heritage city center is critical for achieving sustainable development. This study aims to shed more light on the importance of preserving urban history and how to remove impediments to the advancement of the sustai- nability paradigm. There is a lack of studies and frameworks that can be successfully used in cities at the local level, prompting the research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating local sustainability indicators and encouraging the recons- truction of heritage urban districts?”   Review of Sustainable Development Models Sustainable development is an evolving concept, and heritage is now recognized to have great potential in contributing to social, economic and environmental sustainability goals. Heritage conservation has improved quality of life and reduced carbon emissions [11]. The new urban agenda recognizes heritage as an important factor for urban sustainable development, but there is no general consensus on how to best approach and deal with it. Examining the current redevelopment models is one way to identify the key components of a strong model for assessing sustainability and comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of each model. For the strategic and operational evaluation of sustainable urban redevelopment, a number of methods and tools have   recently been developed, reporting through indicators [12]. These tools are well-liked because they can evaluate urban management performance and competitiveness in the context of sustainability goals [13]. Sustaina- bility analyses provide metrics for activity outcomes and a way to track them over time [14]. They also serve as investment recommendations. They make it possible to set the objectives and support the decision- making procedures. Since they frequently serve multiple functions, they are crucial in operational calculations for the planners, the administrators, the legislators, and the decision-makers. A 2016 study found that the most effective method for assessing the objectivity of sustainable project and policy scopes is rating systems. There are few indicators of heritage status and little scholarly literature devoted to heritage [9]. A set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the potential contribution that heritage can make to sustainable development must be developed because of these factors [15]. Indicators of sustai- nability may be evaluated using a variety of techniques for creating sustainable redevelopment models [16]. Due to its inherent complexity and ambiguity, sustai- nable development is challenging to evaluate and quantify. To assist organize such complexity for the sake of information exchange and decision making, it is necessary to have a complete grasp of the linkages between diverse environmental, economic, and social variables [17-21]. The definition of sustainable development by [22], which strives to provide a systematic framework for developing indicators and information systems, is a key classic text in this area. The primary model types that may be used to create sustainable redevelopment models are combination models [23]. The problem with these approaches is that there is no connection between sustainability goals and sustainability indicators. Three fundamental conceptual frameworks are listed by [24] as being used by indicator initiatives in all throughout the world, which are 1) A framework       for measuring regional sustainability that centers on a long-term outlook for the area; 2) Short-term goal models that don’t attempt to satisfy the requirement to show relationships between indicator regions; 3) Models that emphasize performance assessment. These models’ flaws include their emphasis on Bottom level (Local community) without top level (Expertise). Model is unique in that it incorporates ideas like domains, system orientators, and capitals [25]. Five categories of models are described by [26]: domain, goal, sectoral, issue, and causal frameworks. These models’ flaw is that there is no link between Top and Bottom. Al-Alwani [8] created a methodology to help with local Middle Eastern municipal assessments of sustainability. The disadvantage in this model is focusing on the Top level more than Bottom level. Each of these models and methodologies in above has weaknesses.  Methodology In order to investigate a unique and information rich case that was selected for the in-depth study, this work used a mixed qualitative approach.  Method This paper employs an analytical and descriptive methodology. With the help of this study, a fresh framework for assessing redevelopment projects’ susta Figure 3. Research Method.   inability performance will be created. For the investi- gation of a single case study, this model has been chosen. One instance may satisfy every need for eva- luating the theory, whether to confirm, refute, or expand it. The theory proposition can then be evaluated against the single case (Hilla) to see if it is true or whether another possibility is more pertinent. Data from single or numerous studies are often applied to theories rather than to populations, hence they might be used to support theories but not populations [27]. This research is qualitative and quantitative; weighting factors had been used to analyze the data obtained and focuses on the factors that have direct relevance to the approach to urban redevelopment. These significant determinants were developed based on the theoretical background that established the three major factors which are environmental, social and economic factors. Urban redevelopment is an integrated action that is emerging with the purposes to catch long-term answers to the problems of issues such as physical, social, economic and environmental by participation and coo- peration [28]. In this research a model composed of five key stages (Figure 3) was utilized to assess the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of the redevelopment project. One of the main advantages of this method is that it can be used as a tool for ranking indicators to confirm covered and ignored issues [29]. It raises the ability of indicators to be easier to recognize and to help transfer valuable infor- mation to decision makers [30]. However, the disad- vantage is that it is quite modest and does not collect some of the complex interrelationships between a diversity of the dimensions of sustainability [30].  Data Collection Accurate data collection is essential for maintaining the integrity of research. By selecting the right data collection tools (Figure 4) and outlining how to use          Figure 4. Data collection tools.  them correctly, the likelihood of errors is reduced. A formal process for data collection is necessary to ensure that the data is precise and well-defined. This provides a basis for comparison and offers a suggestion of areas for improvement. In this research five techniques for gathering data were used and highlighted in the following subsections as follow:  Wide ranging review of literature As a conceptual step, data was gathered from many sources, such as prior studies, official reports, and government papers, followed by a study of urban sus- tainability and a comparison of worldwide evaluation methodologies. This research started with a look at the literature on urban redevelopment as a concept, as well as a sustainability evaluation for urban regeneration initiatives. Various materials, including published gover- nment reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research reports, and items appearing on websites and in the media, were studied as part of the literature study. Furthermore, official and academic documents as well as statistical information regarding the case study regeneration have been analysed. Reviewing the available case study literature makes it clear that there is a lack of an all-encompassing policy of urban development that would direct laws in accordance with the demands of the contemporary socio-economic reality. Additionally, some of these rules and regulations can be at odds with the fresh redevelopment ideas. The literature review findings from the first stage were   synthesized to reveal the relevant indicator or criteria. It explains the concepts represented in the analysis and to formulate the requirements for developing the model. These criteria were further refined in the second and third stages conducted with number of experts from various backgrounds of the case study.  Field observation Following the literature review, to gather infor- mation for the case-study analysis, a field investigation was carried out on-site. It’s crucial together data from various sources when performing a case-study analysis. Field observation is one of the best ways to achieve this. Field observation can offer important insights into how people interact with and experience the subject matter in real life after completing a literature review, which gives an overview of the available research on the subject. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct interviews and to make the surveys. During the site visits, researchers made observations in relation to sustainability. During the field research, researchers visited the case study area several times to conduct the interviews, to make the surveys, and to make their own observations in the area in relation to sustainability. The primary sources of data gathering for the study included interviews, questionnaires, and the researchers’ personal observations. The indicators to assess the case study were carried out using the data and information gathered during the field investigation. Taking pictures of buildings and observing the surroundings of the site, which may have an impact on building condition, are also included in this phase. Understanding the cons- truction of historical structures and the history of urban development is also necessary for the case study process.  Semi-structured interview Using open-ended questions, a large number of       interviews were done to look at how locals and stake- holders saw the difficulties associated with urban redevelopment in a case study. In this case study, the local residents and the stakeholders which have know- ledge of urban redevelopment projects in their commu- nity participated in semi-structured interviews. Through these discussions, researchers were able to identify recurring themes regarding the difficulties encoun- tered when implementing such projects, including: a lack of resources; poor communication between the various parties involved; difficulty obtaining necessary permits; and resistance from existing residents due to concern over displacement or lifestyle changes brought on by new development plans. The public’s goals for tackling local urban concerns were elicited through the interview process. One of the most effective methods for acquiring information to comprehend certain app- roaches to urban change has shown to be conducting interviews. As a result, this article is based on a theoretical research, a geographical analysis, and anal- ytical talks with provincial councils, local authorities, architects, planners, decision makers (government officials), religious academics, local inhabitants, and regular visitors to the city. In a case study, twenty interviews were done.  Focus group Discussions and consultation with a panel of experts resulted in the development of a list of local evaluation components. It takes expert advice to sort the criteria found during the literature review and stakeholder interview so that you can understand their local impor- tance. A panel of experts has been established from significant stakeholder groups, including academia, government, and industry. Together, this group evaluates potential paths for social, environmental, and economic growth while speculating on possible future occurrences and scenarios to depict them throughout the visioning stage. This study aims to offer a number of sustai  nability measures. It was found through this focus group that the development technique was sufficient and the signals were reliable. The focus group method is used in this study in order to focus on problems and wishes connected to local sustainability as well as gathering qualitative information and perspectives from a group of people [31].  Questionnaire survey On the basis of iterative questionnaire consultation with expert panels, Delphi is utilized to develop the proper weightings indicators. Panelists were (six experts from the city of Hilla four experts with academic qualifications and two with relevant experience) selected based on their record of publications in the fields of sustainability, urban regeneration, planning, and deve- lopment, as well as their standing in research and reputation on both the national and international levels. Those in the public sector such as planners, economic development and urban regeneration consultants as well as policymakers legislators, real estate developers, regeneration consultants, and others are all represented. After a sufficient level of consensus was attained by using a Delphi technique, the expert responses were gathered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from unimportant to highly important. Experts were given a thorough list of the indicators of redevelopment along with a questionnaire that ranked each indicator’s relative value on an important scale.  Case study The researchers conducted case studies with the aim of completing a thorough investigation of the area to find and describe the phenomena and the essential elements [32]. Additionally, a thorough examination of a case study’s duration frequently forms part of the research design or, at the very least, requires the use of data. Additionally, by reproducing the correlated patterns, the consideration of multiple case studies contributes       to a more reliable result, enhancing the validity and robustness of the theory. Additionally, a three stage procedure is included. The new model was evaluated in a case study to guarantee its dependability. Vali- dating and testing the models before implementing them is a crucial step in ensuring the success of urban redevelopment initiatives. Teams can be sure that their models will function as expected once deployed in cities all over the world by utilizing these techniques during the development phase, such as running simula- tions based on real-world scenarios. Now that it is aware of this, it is able to anticipate even greater advancements made possible by novel solutions, like those offered by our recently tested framework. Veri- fication and testing are necessary for any urban redeve- lopment project to be successful. Teams can make sure that their plans will work in practical situations and produce the best results for citizens by taking the time to evaluate frameworks prior to implementation. The  Figure 5.

Context This study concentrated on Hilla, the provincial capital of Iraq’s Babel province, has a rich history and culture. Hilla, located on the banks of the Euphrates River, has long been an important trading and com- mercial center. Because of its archaeological sites and monuments, it has grown in popularity as a tourist destination in recent years. It is situated at 32.46 latitude and 44.42 longitude (Figure 5). The city of Hilla extends along the eastern and western banks of the Euphrates River. The city has an area of about (5243) hectares and a total population density of (63.71 people/ha). The part that is to be redeveloped in this paper consists of 2 residential neighborhoods. This city was chosen because it possesses traits common to many other Middle Eastern nations and contains a significant number of distinctive cultural heritages that have not yet been certified as cultural heritage struc- tures (Figure 6). Due to its close vicinity to the ancient city of Babylon, which has given the city a great relevance in terms of development potential, Hilla has a unique chance. Additionally, it is one of the major Iraqi cities, and its central business district is home to a large number of viable old buildings. The city has made a concerted effort to appreciate the value of and renovate this old building stock. The case study was also, chosen because it was thought that it may serve as a suitable illustration for the examination of local urban redevelopment strategies and serve as an example of the lessons that can be gained from local redeve- lopment initiatives.  Case Study application The research started with literature reviews on urban       redevelopment concept and sustainability assessment for urban redevelopment projects. Numerous materials, including officially released reports, census data, books, articles, formal studies, research papers, articles from websites and media, have been examined. To gather data and information for the case study analysis, a field study had been carried out locally after the literature review. During the field research, several interviews were made with many stakeholders and local people living in the city. The interviews and survey are consisted of ques- tions such as: What are problems and challenges in  Table 1. some problems that investigated at the case study  Inadequate water supply infrastructure for large areas of the population    Inadequate sanitation systems  Hazards of disease spread brought on by amassed garbage  Dangers associated with the release of harmful substances and pollutants into the atmosphere, soil, and groundwater    Contamination of the air, water, and soil Scarcity of water resources Desertification Absence of waste recycling Raw polluted areas Ineffective infrastructure Acute housing shortage Absence of the effective public services such as hospitals and educations in urban areas    Reduction of drinkable water Growing traffic congestions Ineffective electricity grid Absence and inefficient paving streets  Absence of satisfactory housing for deprived families Absence of educational buildings   Unemployment  Population exceeds the number of homes  Absence of investment in sustainable development Lack of car parks Lack of yards, open areas and gardens Narrowness of dimensions of the streets   your city? What are your wishes for redevelopment your city? How can your city be improved in your view? The focus group had been conducted and consists of expertise to build -up a list of indicators and the final form of the assessment model was achieved through Questionnaire survey (Delphi technique).  Problems Identification This research study is focused on building a model for redevelopment assessment of old building with emphasis on sustainable redevelopment in old part in Hilla. The primary sources of data for the study were surveys, interviews, fieldwork, and the researchers’ personal observations in addition to analysis of the literature to determine the key difficulties or concerns of local sustainability in the city of Hilla, Iraq, as the chosen case study. The indicator-based evaluation of the case study was conducted using the data and information (Table 1) gathered during the field inves- tigation.  Build-up sustainable redevelopment Indicators For efficient group discussions, it is advised that the size be between six and twelve [34]. Ten people were in the focus group for this case study. Each indication had been constructed using a logic process that was devised in cooperation with the experts from various  Figure 7. Proposed redevelopment indicators that inte- grated in each sustainability dimension.           disciplines present at this focus group, and all concerns expressed were organized into their associated dimen- sions as shown in Figure 7.  Delphi technique The Delphi approach was used to generate group agreement based on expert opinions when the intended redevelopment indicators were met [35]. Experts with comprehensive knowledge of linked topics and skilled specialists participated. The use of the multi-stage   tionnaire with an itemized rating system was used to rank indications on a priority basis, with forty experts participating in practice. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insig- nificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model  Table 2.

Two crucial rounds of the Delphi approach were used in this study: idea generation to help restrict the field or insight. Delphi searches for as much more information as it can simultaneously in order to educate and foster consensus by fusing a wide variety of expert viewpoints [37].

Following the first round of Delphi questionnaires, expert opinion showed that there was no extension of the original list of indicators and no modifications in the indicators found in the previous phase (focus group). They were then moved into the quantitative stage to determine their relative relevance. A ques       \twater bodies\t Figure 8.

Discussion of Results The research establishes to address the main research question: “How can we create a methodology for evaluating sustainability indicators and encouraging the reconstruction of historic urban districts? In order to address this main research question, the research in this paper built a new methodology to develop suitable local sustainability indicators to facilitate assessment of local sustainability and verified the new methodology for its applicability in heritage part for city of Hilla as a case study. The replies were tallied on a Likert-type scale with five possible outcomes: insignificant (1), of little relevance (2), slightly important (3), important (4), and highly important (5). This led to the creation of the ultimate list of suggested model urban redeve- lopment indicators, which is shown in Figure 7   includes three main dimensions and 25 urban indi- cators that are prioritized. The indicator with the greatest priority is “Improved Infrastructure networks,” which is followed by “Reduce unemployment” indicator, “Encourage Employability” indicator, “Energy Distri- bution Network” indicator, “Energy efficiency” indicator, and “Modern Sanitation Facilities and Water Networks” indicator. The respondents ranked the conservation of water bodies as being more essential than reducing noise pollution, which had the lowest mean score and greatest sustainability. These results demonstrate that the model is founded on an awareness of the main problems and obstacles associated with local urban regeneration. According to Figure 7, these results may appear unexpected at first sight, but they are really common and expected, particularly in a nation like Iraq where several conflicts have contributed to poverty and instability. Participants also gave priority to these issues since Hilla struggles much in them and because they speak to the needs of the neighborhood. Analysis reveals that participation in heritage is the key element that has the greatest potential to lead to long-term sustainable development. Neighborhood residents were unable to take part in the consultation process due to the lack of formal structures, and many were unclear about the heritage policy. To effectively communicate protection, there needs to be a point of contact between the general public and the local government. By comparing the results obtained in the fieldwork with the theory in literature review, we can confirm that. The new methodology in this paper successfully collected related social, economic, environmental and institutional problems in the heritage part of the city of Hilla over the use of source document analysis, inter- views and focus groups     The development of unsuitable health buildings results from an inappropriate briefing between architects and builders, and even where the facilities are constructed correctly, they are not properly used (Silva Santos, 2006). Furthermore, new health centers are often achieved by adapting existing buildings that do not reflect the regulations. Consequently, the primary health care facility’s physical space is inadequate to carry out the required healthcare activity. Improving the physical environment in health facilities is now considered a necessity. A consolidated and generalized procedure is needed to ensure proper planning to help designers to build appropriate and integrated facilities in various developing contexts, especially in remote areas where healthcare problems are increasing due to the lack of medical assistance, water, transport and electricity, to identify the possibilities in the area and above all the problems to solve them rationally. Planning a social health center requires a multidisciplinary approach to organize the building over time effectively. The health facility should respond to the rapid changes and the Improving physical space of health facilities 575 The author would like to thank the Sustainable Research Lab (SA Lab) and Prince Sultan University for their financial support.

Thus, the requirements of flexibility, modularity, aggregation and reversibility become a key component to respond to the health structure’s subsequent transformations. This paper on primary care centers addresses a gap in the healthcare field by exploring the physical features of health units associated with favorable user outcomes (Gulwadi et al., 2009). A study was carried out on the architectural configuration of some health centers in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador (RMS), Bahia state in Brazil, according to a mixed method to improve basic health facilities’ physical environment. The research aims to verify the state and the work carried out now on health centers and define design strategies to improve the architectural space. 2. Theoretical framework Previously, several studies have been done to investigate the current state of quality in healthcare architecture. For example, usability is one of the evaluations that assess quality-inuse. It is measured by three parameters: the effectiveness and efficiency of the design or facilities offered and the user’s satisfaction (Harun et al., 2011). Ariadne Labs has created guidelines for designers and facilities under construction to design in the healthcare sector focused on childbirth, explaining, for example, how the quality of the environment and especially three factors such as capacity, workload and motivation affect the decision to perform a cesarean delivery (Ariadne Labs, 2017). Another study shows factors influencing spatial layouts in healthcare buildings, such as safety and well-being, user satisfaction, organizational and technological adaptability to future changes, spatial configuration, energy, and environment (Zhao et al., 2009). The same authors Zhao and Mourshed explored in a newer article the patients’ perspectives on the design of hospital outpatient areas. Their research evaluated outpatients’ perspectives of the space of the waiting area by investigating their opinion on a range of hospital design indicators and reflecting on the building design process (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Additionally, the results of another study, functional efficiency, user satisfaction, environmental issues, patient safety and flexibility were considered the main problems in the physical environment of healthcare facilities. Issues such as user satisfaction, patient safety and accountability in incidents have often been investigated in terms of management strategies, quality of medical and nursing services, and medical equipment facilities; instead, the role of architecture in improving the mentioned factors has gone unnoticed (Ebrahimi et al., 2013). For this reason, starting from the literature review, the design elements that influence the quality-in-use of the architectural space have been analyzed under three main aspects: (1) Capacity of the structure and adaptability to changes; (2) Functional efficiency and (3) Accessibility and circulation of external and internal spaces. These three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate testable hypotheses verified by users’ perspectives based on an extensive review of the literature and through direct observation on-site visits. 3. Background The Alma-Ata Declaration (1978) remains a pivotal document in global health history, setting a standard of public commitment to make community-led quality healthcare accessible to all, physically and financially. This was the forerunner of the Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000, pursued by WHO and its partners for the rest of the twentieth century, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: “Ensuring lives healthy and promote well-being for all at all ages” by 2030. ARCH 16,3 576 Health-related SDGs can only be achieved sustainably with a greater emphasis on primary health care. Therefore, renewing primary health care and placing it at the center of efforts to improve health and well-being is essential to respond to a complex and rapidly changing world (World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2018). Consequently, it is necessary to rethink the design and construction of new primary health care facilities and the adaptation of existing ones, particularly the decisionmaking process during the initial stages. Decisions regarding physical characteristics such as layout design and shape are made early and are difficult to change or reverse later without significant financial commitments (Zhao et al., 2009). Because walls are expensive to erect, floor plans of healthcare facilities do not usually change much in the short term. However, as healthcare systems evolve, clinical environments have changing needs, and spaces within the building can frequently change every two to three years. Nevertheless, even when changes are expected, contingency planning and health projects are rarely informed by empirical evidence of what works and what does not. Consequences of limited testing include the propagation of low architectural value projects, costly and potentially harmful to patients (Ariadne Labs, 2017). Few researchers found that the project draws on previously acquired knowledge, insights and beliefs derived from decision-making experience. Most of the design related to healthcare environments is adopted and adapted without knowing if users are satisfied. Despite this lack of knowledge, a healthcare center should meet people’s needs and achieve balance in the outcome. Therefore, there is a relationship between the satisfaction of a facility by the user and a coherent design of the architectural space that brings patients a positive experience and greater liveability of the healthcare facility (Asfour, 2020). Spatial boundaries also influence the user’s use of space by the physical and attractive environment (Harun et al., 2011). In the existing literature relating to the user experience with the healthcare environment, only a small number of participatory studies focus on spatial design aspects. Most of the studies concern the quality of service and user satisfaction of the physical environment and systems, rather than focusing on the user perspectives associated with the design factors of the built environment in healthcare. However, the perceptions and expectations of patients and clients are strongly linked to the use of space in the design of healthcare buildings. Nevertheless, the design factors of healthcare facilities should be better integrated into the design phase, which has remained largely neglected (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). Therefore, it is also necessary to consider the architectural environment and focus the attention on spatial design to relate users with space. Previous studies have shown that good space design reflects health, emotion, reduction of stress and frustration for the visitor, functional efficiency, visitor accessibility, safety, patient empowerment and cognitive abilities in spatial understanding (Harun et al., 2011). One of the factors that influence the end users is designing the space’s layout, which is considered as one of the main activities in the architectural project, both in new construction and building adaptation. The layout design involves locating activity spaces or objects in a container space to maximize or minimize design goals while meeting the required spatial relationships between component spaces or objects (Ezzeldin et al., 2021). Designing primary health care buildings’ spaces requires special attention due to the close and complicated relationships between space and function (Zhao et al., 2009). However, little research has been done on the space layout of primary health buildings. The research reported here investigates the factors that influence the design of space layouts in healthcare buildings taking into account the perspective of users. 3.1 Primary health care system in Brazil Since the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, whose purpose was to achieve “Health for All,” Brazil has implemented the Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Sa  ude [SUS]) and organized  Improving physical space of health facilities 577 health services. It also defined primary health care as a gateway and the main strategy to accomplish the goal and promote health, prevention through universality, integrity and equity. However, primary health care in Brazil is characterized by problems of the facilities’ physical environment (Facchini et al., 2006). The Ministry of Health in 1994 implements primary health care with the Family Health Strategy to reorganize basic care in the SUS. The Family Health Team implements this strategy, a multi-professional team that assists the families within the Basic Health Unit, responsible for a specific number of families in a defined geographical area (Marqui et al., 2010). There can be a maximum of five Family Health Teams in each health center to have greater population coverage. It is recommended that each team be responsible for between 600 and 1,000 families (2,400 to 4,500 inhabitants), with an average of 3,000 people (Escorel et al., 2007). The Ministerial Decree No. 2,226/2009 establishes the National Plan for the Implementation of Basic Health Units for Family Health Teams to guide professionals and municipal health managers in designing, planning projects for the construction and extension of primary health units. The tool has 15 activities (Figure 1): reception, waiting area, medical record room, meeting room, health agent room, medical office, procedure room, vaccination room, collection room, nebulization room, curative room, dental office, brushing room, compressor and pump area and sterilization room. The area of these spaces and the activities can also be extended according to the local needs and the activities planned, such as administration or management room, warehouse and pharmacy (Ministerio da Saude, 2009  ). Although Brazil has not achieved the “Health for All by the Year 2000” target, it has made significant progress, even though the Brazilian National Health System does not work at full capacity. Previous studies conducted in some Bahia municipalities, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso have shown deficiencies in the physical structure. “Multicenter survey conducted in seven Brazilian states showed the architectural deficits of these health units, for 59.8% of the units were classified as inadequate, as for their infrastructure” (Gomes et al., 2015). Figure 1. Suggested activities for primary health care center in Brazil ARCH 16,3 578 Given the Family Health Team’s interdisciplinary nature, the use of physical spaces must be thought of in a new way, allowing their use in a shared way between different professionals and activities at different times. Functional requirements change. The change can take place in different time cycles (short, medium and long term) and at various levels: from the replacement of the equipment to the renewal and expansion of the medical offices, to the complete change in the use of the spaces, to the expansion of the structure. The change can occur either because some parts become obsolete or because of a change in medical practices or the organizational patterns of activities. The key to a health center being able to manage change is to use flexible buildings effectively (Kendall, 2012). “The next generation of health care buildings for the primary sector will be flexible long-life buildings, based on a comprehensive briefing document where design quality plays a major part in establishing the design philosophy” (Purves, 2002, p. 23). 4. Methodology This study applies a mixed-method approach that combines and integrates observational research and the descriptive analysis of six different primary health care facilities (USFs) design. The research was conducted on-site between May and October 2016 in the north-east of Brazil, in the state of Bahia, and precisely in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador characterized by a high index of urbanization and population density compared to the rest of the state and brings together large urban centers with diversified and specialized functions. It includes 13 municipalities, such as Salvador and the neighboring Lauro de Freitas, which are the subjects of this research. According to a territorial analysis (detailed in the following paragraph), the researcher selected several primary health units to maximize the diversity of facilities. The design elements measured in this study have been identified based on the literature review carried out so far. These elements have been further refined and adapted to the reference context. Therefore, from the literature review focusing on the impact of design on healthcare environments, the design elements that could affect the architectural space were analyzed under three aspects: facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility (Table 1). The three criteria were used to interpret the explanatory results and generate verifiable hypotheses. The health outcomes of each of these three criteria were analyzed through a Table 1. Criteria for analyzing the primary health care facilities Improving physical space of health facilities 579 cross-sectional analysis through the experience and perception of users derived from the existing literature review and the direct observation during site visits. This allowed to strengthen the subjective experience of the user and not to focus the results obtained on the functionality of the building in terms of administration and healthcare delivery as a service. User satisfaction connects the perception and experience of spaces with the architectural design of the health facilities. The purpose and the use of the spaces were confirmed by on-site visits with sketches and photographs, users’ observations and facility managers’ interviews. The researcher requested the floor plans for the selected facilities. Floor plans were redesigned as needed using design software to identify and count rooms by type and measure key distances and spaces. Further reasoning was made to interpret these results to generate specific hypotheses on how the design can influence physical space design through the user’s experience. The project posed no risk to users, and site visits were authorized by the clinical director of each facility visited. 4.1 Facility selection The selection of six primary health units has enabled the acquisition of a wide range of facilities in different districts. To identify candidate facilities, a study of Salvador and Lauro de Freitas’s territory was carried out considering their division into health districts rather than administrative ones. Of all the RMS cities, Salvador is the most important, as it is the capital of the State of Bahia, with about 2,886,698 inhabitants (IBGE, 2020) and occupies a territorial extension of 693,453 km2 (2019). Its political and administrative organization includes 18 administrative regions and 12 health districts. Instead, Lauro de Freitas has an estimated population of 201,635 (IBGE, 2020) with a land area of 58,143 km2 (2019) and is divided into 19 administrative districts and 7 health districts. The six units’ selection criteria were based on a territorial study based on the distribution of five types of development in the analyzed territory: low, medium-low, medium, mediumhigh and high (Figure 2). The health centers (USF) were then superimposed on the development zones map (Carvalho and Silva, 2009). Figure 2. Criteria for the health facilities selected for inclusion in the study ARCH 16,3 580 The analysis shows that the primary health care facilities partially uncover part of the eastern coast along the Atlantic Ocean. This area is mainly composed of high-income populations that mainly benefit from private services, without recourse to the aid with low efficiency characterized by long waiting time. On the other hand, the disadvantaged areas are found in the central area and on the internal coast of Bay of All Saints (Baıa de Todos os Santos), where a greater concentration of primary health care units emerges to help deprived people. To have a different range of health facilities, three units in the less developed health district (Suburbio Ferrovi  ario) and a health unit in a developed area (Itapu~a) located along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean were selected for the municipality of Salvador. While in Lauro de Freitas, two health units have been selected, one in the northern marginal district (Areia Branca) and the other in a developed area along the coast (Ipitanga). In the peripheral area of the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador, the health facilities of Unidade de Saude da Fam  ılia (USF) Alto de Coutos, USF Alto de Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha were analyzed, instead in the high development area of the Itapu~a, the USF Mussurunga was selected. In Lauro de Freitas, the USF Parque S~ao Paulo in the marginal district of Areia Branca and the USF Vila Praiana in the developed area of Ipitanga were considered for the study. 5. Design data collection The data collection was structured in three parts: site visits, interviews and facility profile. 5.1 Site visits The researcher conducted site visits at the six selected units (Figure 3) to capture a wide range of facility types in the different development zones. During each visit, the researcher met with Figure 3. Geographic distribution of the six facilities selected for site visits and interviews Improving physical space of health facilities 581 the facility’s representatives, including clinical directors, nursing managers and operations managers. The researcher organized a structured site visit guide to provide a standardized organization at each visit and ensure that all research questions were discussed with each facility team. Each site visit lasted approximately three hours, including an introductory conversation to understand the building and facility’s history, a facility tour following the patient’s pathway through the center. 5.2 Interviews The most important findings identified during the site visits and which had not been captured through floor plans were identified, including descriptive details on how specific design elements influenced care. Based on these results, on-site interviews were carried out, trying to cover as much information as possible in a period of about half an hour. The interviews were conducted with the team present in the building during the visit, involving the facility’s representatives (clinical directors, nursing managers and operations managers). Facility managers were interviewed as they are aware of user feedback and experiences. The facility manager’s task is to improve the environment, people, spatial relationships, functional, environmental and economic aspects (Harun et al., 2011). The interviewer took notes to use in the data analysis. Like site visits, information from interviews increased the data accessed from floor plan analysis and improved understanding of relevant issues and assumptions about how design affects care. Furthermore, during the on-site visits, walking through accessible public spaces, waiting rooms and waiting corridors, it was observed how users use and perceive the health center’s space and activities. This method is used to learn about the intended uses, new uses and misuses of design. 5.3 Facility profiles To collect the data, each health unit was personally visited by the researcher and evaluated through direct observation and the application of structured tables divided into the three criteria mentioned above useful for the analysis. To complete the table about the health center’s general data, especially the year of construction, the number of employees, the Family Health Team, and the patients per day, it was necessary to consult the facility manager. During the tour, the researcher sketched the relevant aspects of the health center for later analysis, such as representing the accessibility of the structure of USF Alto de Coutos II or the waiting area of USF Parque S~ao Paulo (Figure 4). Sketches of the floor plans (Figure 5) define the spaces’ dimensions and the activities’ subdivision, useful for filling the table’s functional efficiency. The researcher photographed key areas (Plate 1) to verify the physical Figure 4. USF Alto de Coutos II/ USF Parque S~ao Paulo: sketches of accessibility and waiting area ARCH 16,3 582 aspects and the quality of the spaces surveyed to compare them with the acquired plans. Subsequently, the researcher was authorized to collect the selected health centers’ digital plans in the prefecture. The acquired plans were updated and implemented following the changes in the activities identified by the researcher during the inspection. The floor plans were traced using an architectural drawing software (Figure 6) to equalize measures for comparison across facilities’ measured areas (square meters), distances (meters) and units (number) using built-in computer-aided design software tools. 6. Results The comparative analysis between the case studies is summarized in the tables corresponding to the three criteria identified. Facility capacity, functional efficiency and space accessibility have been considered the facilities’ main problems in the investigated context. To verify the results obtained by the three criteria, the patients’ perspective was considered to assess their satisfaction in relation to the architecture design. Figure 5.

Facility capacity analysis Figure 6. USF Parque S~ao Paulo, Lauro de Freitas: digital plan updated according to the site visit ARCH 16,3 584 multifunction activities in an area and expandability of spaces in addition to general data such as the year of construction, days and hours of the opening, which only serve to give a general picture of the facilities. (1) Adaptability in design. From the site visit and the data compared in the table, it can be seen how three of the six structures analyzed are not built to be primary health units; USF Vila Praiana and USF Parque S~ao Paulo are examples. Both are residential villas that were later adapted to the health function. It was found that most of the primary health care centers of Salvador and Lauro de Freitas are existing structures born as living spaces unsuitable for the health facility. As a private space, the house is unsuitable to the health function because often the residential spaces do not respect the minimum size provided by the Ministerial Decree. An example is the USF Vila Praiana, with limited waiting spaces and small corridors that do not adequately allow users to circulate. Converting residential spaces with healthcare functions involves an inadequate distribution of activities and a difficult distribution of flows between doctors and patients. In addition to these USFs derived from existing buildings, there are also primary health care units considered as “model” health facilities, such as USF Alto de Coutos II in Salvador. Visiting this health center, it was possible to perceive that this building was built to be a health center respecting a clear functional organization of spaces following regulations and legislation. (2) Expandability of spaces. The buildings, even those built to be health centers, were not planned to be enlarged in the future. However, the on-site surveys noted the possibility of some buildings being expanded by occupying the nearby parking lot or garden. However, this would entail high costs as the structure was not designed in a modular way or was not designed to expand in the future. For example, in the USF Alto da Terezinha, it is evident that inner space is reduced, and the structure needs to be enlarged to accommodate new medical offices. Therefore, it is clear how the structure, despite being newly built, is not very flexible. (3) Facility size. From the observational research on-site and the analysis carried out, activities that do not comply with the minimum dimensions provided for by the Ministerial Decree 2.226/09 are noted. The houses adapted to health centers have dimensions that are not quite adequate to perform the health function. The overall area of a building can be considered an upstream measure that affects many other functional areas, the quality of circulation and staff support spaces’ capacity. The positive thing is that this has allowed us to begin to have internal flexibility of the spaces, such as the meeting room that has both an educational and refreshment function in the USF Alto da Terezinha, or some clinics are shared by different doctors on rotation to carry out the various activities. However, the small size of some rooms also limits their potential usability and space flexibility. To verify the results obtained on the capacity of the building, the perception of users was considered through some main factors listed in Table 3, as there is a strong interest in the patient-centered design of healthcare facilities by integrating the perception of users with the physical environment. Evidence from the literature review indicate that users expect more from the healthcare environment in addition to a high-quality health service, such as appropriate and defined waiting area, suitable space for families to wait, adequate number of seats, seating comfort, entertainment facilities, appropriate and proportionate spaces to be used by staff and users, spaciousness Improving physical space of health facilities 585 and respect for user privacy (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Reiling et al., 2008; Fausto et al., 2017; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). The direct observation of users during on-site visits, such as their experience of inaccessibility of the spaces with reduced dimensions of the healthcare facility environments, confirmed how these factors affect the outcome of the facility’s capacity. Furthermore, the existing literature suggests that the number of visits of the users to the health facility has influenced their perspectives on spatial and seating aspects (Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). The crowded waiting room and corridors make users uncomfortable with the surrounding environment; this factor is one of the most important in the patient’s perspectives, and deserves more attention in the design process. Therefore, the facility design can have a direct impact on users’ satisfaction, a patient’s stress experience and organizational performance metrics (Reiling et al., 2008). 6.2 Functional efficiency According to the on-site analysis and comparing the six healthcare facilities, a key issue of the physical environment considered in the research was the functional efficiency, including nonfunctioning supplies and the distribution of functions present in health facilities (Table 4). (1) Broken furniture. From the comparative analysis described in Table 4, it is observed that some spaces are closed to the public due to faulty or malfunctioning equipment. For example, the main problems related to the closure of some doctors’ offices are listed below.  USF Alto de Coutos II, the curative room’s air conditioning is malfunctioning, so the room has been closed. The door and the window of the sterilization room do not follow the regulations.  USF Alto de Coutos, one of the dental offices, is closed due to a medical equipment’s malfunction.  USF Alto da Terezinha has several problems, including one of the rooms dedicated to dentists is closed due to the medical equipment’s malfunction. The curative room is closed due to the air conditioning’s malfunction, and the sterilization room has broken equipment (autoclave). Therefore, there is a lack of maintenance in various structures to have an efficient functionality of the spaces. (2) Recognizable functional units. The medical offices do not have a specific name from the information collected, but they are also subdivided into nursing and doctor office. Functional units are not always recognizable. Signs indicate that various rooms in the structures are designed to be health facilities but without specifying the exact activity. Also, outside the doors of each clinic room, there is a sign with the words Clinic 01, Clinic 02, Clinic 03, etc. but the internal function is not clear. This does not facilitate the user in identifying spaces within the structure. Table 3. Factors identified by users’ perspective related to facility capacity criteria ARCH 16,3 586 (3) Zoning of health facilities space. From the analysis of the researcher’s drawings, such as the diagrams shown below, we can see the different distribution of the plans and activities between USF Alto De Coutos II and USF Alto da Terezinha (Figure 7). The USF Alto De Coutos II is represented in the first exploded view diagram on the left of Figure 7. It is considered a model health center. The health function activities are distributed on a single floor, on the ground level. Additional space in the basement with the auditorium function is intended for the staff of the health facility. Therefore, the specific activities are distributed along the corridor’s sides, divided according to the four general activities mentioned above (administrative area, clinical area, dental care and logistic support). The second diagram instead highlights the USF Alto da Terezinha consisting of two floors. Healthcare activities are distributed on both floors but present problems in terms of accessibility and usability of the paths due to the lack of an elevator that would facilitate access for disabled people or patients in difficulty reaching the second floor where the activities are distributed for clinical care. The difficulty of using the space is also noted in the USF Mussurunga and the USF Vila Praiana. Key Table 4. Functional efficiency analysis Improving physical space of health facilities 587 According to the users’ perspective in the literature review, some basic problems of the physical environment were considered from the point of view of functional efficiency (Table 5), including the use of space and the building, a thermally comfortable environment, the wide gap between spaces with functional capacity and the scarce use of information technology as a communication tool. The problem of distance, orientation and dislocation of services on several levels will cause the patient tired, especially for the disabled and the elderly. Furthermore, users consider cleanliness, air freshness, noise and thermal comfort as important to their experience in healthcare facilities. Efficiency does not take too long to fix, as it is easily accessible (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). 6.3 Space accessibility The third criterion, space accessibility, has been analyzed in Table 6 under the aspect of urban accessibility, the presence of parking lots, the analysis of the external spaces and internal evaluations of the structure. Figure 7. Diagrams of plan distributions and activities configuration Table 5. Factors identified by users’ perspective related to functional efficiency criteria ARCH 16,3 588 (1) Urban accessibility. One of the problems identified during the site visits, especially in the marginal districts, concerns the accessibility of the facilities. Roads in underdeveloped districts, such as the Suburbio Ferrovi  ario in Salvador and the Areia Branca in Lauro de Freitas, have roads that are not very accessible, such as the USF Parque S~ao Paulo, which has no paved roads. Furthermore, it is not simple to find the health center’s location because it is not indicated precisely on the map. Or the USF Alto de Coutos is difficult to access in case of rain, becoming a torrential road. The two structures located in the districts along the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore in the developed area, have good accessibility. (2) Parking area. Among the public spaces, the parking is undesirable, lacking enough parking lots in the disadvantaged health districts. Therefore, besides being not very accessible, these structures are difficult to access due to the lack of parking spaces or parking lots closed or open only to healthcare staff. (3) Landscaping area and external spaces. The external areas are not present in the analyzed structures, and where present, they are poorly maintained. An example is the USF Parque S~ao Paulo, where the garden is used as a parking lot rather than a social space for users. Or the garden of the USF Vila Praiana, which is dangerous, as being a residential villa adapted to the health function, has an abandoned swimming pool without protection and the risk of falling. A focus on outdoor public spaces should, therefore, be considered. (4) Path circulation and waiting areas in inner spaces. The waiting areas are not always of adequate size for the facility’s capacity, as in the USF Alto de Coutos, where the waiting area is disproportionate to the number of activities. Furthermore, the waiting areas are not always located inside the structure but they are located outside (USF Parque S~ao Paulo and USF Vila Praiana) due to lack of space. There are no waiting Public area Salvador Lauro de Freitas USF Alto de Coutos USF Alto de Coutos II USF Alto da Terezinha USF Mussurunga USF Parque S~ao Paulo USF Vila Praiana Space accessibility (1) Urban accessibility High difficulty High difficulty Medium difficulty Easily accessible Medium difficulty Easily accessible (2) Parking Not present Yes, but not accessible Yes, but closed Yes Not properly Yes The parking is the garden (3) Veranda No No No No Yes Yes Garden/patio No No No Yes Yes Yes Terrace No Yes, but not accessible Yes No Yes Yes (4) Main waiting area Yes, but too small Yes Yes Yes No, outside in the veranda No, outside in the veranda Waiting areas near room entrances In the corridor No In the corridor In the corridor No No Table 6. Space accessibility analysis Improving physical space of health facilities 589 areas near the medical offices and rooms. However, corridors are still used, which sometimes not having adequate dimensions have limited spaces to perform the distribution function, as in existing structures (USF Alto de Coutos, USF Parque S~ao Paulo and USF Praiana) where the corridors have insufficient space to be walked especially by a patient who walks with difficulty. USF Alto da Terezinha was an example to analyze the path circulation within the facility (Figure 8). The plan was redesigned, and the activities were distributed based on the information gathered during the inspection. In the service spaces (corridors), the main paths have been drawn divided between patients/visitors and medical staff (doctors, nurses and public employees). However, what emerges from the analysis is a mixed path of users without differentiation between the two categories. A first suggestion would be to dedicate the entire upper floor to logistic and administrative activities that are restricted access areas and used by doctors, nurses and officials to bring the care activities only to the lower floor to ensure greater accessibility to the patients. Space accessibility means how it is easy for users to reach the health facility or the interior space to get the services they need. Accessing or having a view of the internal and external landscape is one of the key factors of the users’ perception. Another important factor related to the user’s emotional comfort is the absence of openings capable of viewing the outside of the building and the surrounding landscape, especially in the waiting areas where the patient spends time before being allowed to access the medical offices (Table 7). Figure 8. USF Alto da Terezinha, Salvador: path network of medical staff and patients Table 7. Factors identified by users’ perspective related to space accessibility criteria ARCH 16,3 590 The windows in the waiting room would increase the user’s social comfort by integrating the environment with natural light. Furthermore, data from the literature review indicates that exposure to light is a key factor to the health and well-being of users in healthcare environments. However, considering the excessive daylight in the Brazilian context, it can also cause visual discomfort. A large window could let in more daylight while consuming more energy for heating or cooling at the same time. Therefore, artificial light should be adequately balanced with natural light to achieve good thermal and social comfort (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Harun et al., 2011; Zhao and Mourshed, 2017). 7. Conclusion and implications of the study The awareness that primary health care is gaining importance is increasing in different parts of the world, including in Brazil, whose situation is reinforced by numerous studies that address accessibility to primary health care, or strategic plans to improve the Family Health Team, or studies on the accessibility of structures and so on. The search for guidelines oriented toward primary health care architecture, in line with SUS’s principles, is one of the great challenges that the Brazilian healthcare system still faces. The primary health units must satisfy the users and respect the Ministry of Health’s physical and human structure standards. However, in this study, albeit limited to a specific area, the data show that Salvador and Lauro de Freitas’s cities do not offer users a service that reaches the ideal standards in its facility, in most health units inspected. There is a need for better control of the health sector, as the inadequacy of a primary health care unit’s physical structure directly affects the quality of the community’s service. The topic investigated is important for medical and nursing staff since professionals who have greater contact with the population and their actions depend directly on the unit’s infrastructure to improve healthcare and, consequently, obtain better health results. The results of the work are part of the tools to support the concept of primary health care centers; the research outlined in this paper has highlighted the importance of some aspects of designing healthcare facilities, such as the capacity, the functional efficiency and the spatial accessibility of the primary health care facilities. Integrating the results of these three criteria with users’ perspectives to the architectural project was crucial. The research considered the users’ perspective based on data from the literature review and on-site visits to healthcare facilities. The perspectives of the users confirm the expected results of the three criteria analyzed, influencing the health outcomes. A consistent result of this analysis is users’ preference for an environment that offered quality and comfortable space, rather than a place that only addresses the functionality of the building. This result confirms the inadequacy of converting residential buildings to healthcare facilities as they require a space of appropriate size. Furthermore, users have shown interest in a comfortable healthcare environment with good signage and technological information tools and better zoning of the space with adequate distribution of medical offices and greater accessibility and usability of the facility. Another aspect considered fundamental by users is their emotional comfort through openings in the waiting room that allow the relationship between the internal and external landscape, and this is a fundamental aspect that should be integrated into the six health centers analyzed and extended to the other health facilities. The main factors expected by users confirmed the data of the three criteria used to interpret the results and verify hypotheses. Therefore, user satisfaction has a strong impact on the design process of health centers. Particular attention was paid to the spaces created in the healthcare sector, favoring an improvement in the physical space configurations, which must be considered a space of comfort and well-being, sensitive to social needs and ensuring the spaces’ flexibility. Therefore, it is not enough to have sufficient resources to build health facilities if one does not care to guarantee the correct configuration of spaces and maintenance of these physical spaces. Improving physical space of health facilities 591 The present study aims to guide municipal health professionals and managers in the planning, programming and building of basic health units taking into consideration the users’ perspective. The planning strategies, born from theoretical studies and the analysis and evaluations of case studies located in Brazil, are applicable for designing new primary health care centers in similar areas. The suggested spaces should adapt to the local reality that activities will change according to each territory examined and open up so many investigation worlds. Defining the primary health care facilities’ characteristics is not easy due to the higher incidence of prevention and the consequent increase in outpatient areas. Despite the standardization of the design choices and functional grouping, the overall composition of future structures’ design will meet the flexibility requirements both in the design and operational phases. Therefore, it is even more important that healthcare facilities built in the future are designed to flexibly meet changing needs, including those that can be anticipated and those that cannot even be imagined. It is worth recalling that the analysis made up to now highlights the importance and potentiality of the architectural space and its configuration, that is, the order of the spatial relationships the building consists of. These configuration aspects acquire a significant role in the healthcare center when they relate to functional and organizational relationships based on the architectural project. Space analysis allows us to visualize it as potentially occupied by user groups. In architectural composition, the relationship between user and architect is very close and contributes to creating the physical environment. This study has fielded fundamental reflections on strategies related to the design of the first-level health architectural space, considering the perspectives of users on health outcomes. It can be seen as a challenge that should be assimilated into the routine configuration of health structures by professionals and health teams. Only in this way will a new space of action for architects be opened, essential to the healthcare building’s full development in its heal and care mission. Combining evidence-based design with improvements to spatial design processes and the user experience and perception of the building design will provide thoughtful reflection and guidance for clinical architect collaborators who intend to build functional, flexible and quality environments     Canada’s first alongside midwifery unit (AMU) opened in Markham Stouffville Hospital, Ontario, in July 2018. The AMU is a physically separate birthing unit governed and staffed by midwives. The unit is in close proximity to the labor and delivery (L&D) unit, so that in the event of an emergency, patients can be easily moved. For more detail on the setup and function of the AMU, see Cameron et al. (2019). The design of the AMU was informed by existing evidence on the impact of the built environment on birth out\u0002comes (Breedlove & Rathbun, 2019; Hodnett et al., 2009; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013; Newburn & Singh, 2003) and through the use of an evidence-based guide, the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET; Foureur et al., 2010; Jenkinson et al., 2014). The BUDSET is based on a set of birth environment design principles and is used to measure the optimality of birth settings (Foureur et al., 2010). The built environment refers to sur\u0002roundings created for humans, by humans, that provide the setting for human activities and includes everything from landscapes to infrastruc\u0002ture to cities themselves (University of Windsor, 2021). The AMU’s built environment encompasses the physical rooms as well as the architecture, d´ecor, tools, and amenities available, including the labor rooms, bathrooms, and common spaces. Compared to conventional hospital units, the AMU was purposefully designed aesthetically as a “home-like” environment and was equipped to provide comprehensive intrapartum care. While we describe the AMU as “home-like” and much of the literature describes creating domestic birth spaces, we explicitly recognize that the concept of “home” is not universal. It is important to deconstruct this term which is pervasive in the research. In general, “home-like” is used to imply a place of safety, security, autonomy, and domesticity; however, this may not be true for all childbearing people, and for some, home may be an unsafe place (Fannin, 2003; Michie, 1998). The intention underlying the terminology is that the space is less institutional, more personal, and more familiar (Nilsson et al., 2020). Review of the Literature The physical environment significantly influ\u0002ences service user’s feelings of safety, relaxation, sense of comfort, well-being, control, stress lev\u0002els, satisfaction, and outcomes during birth (Newburn & Singh, 2003; Rudman et al., 2007; Setola et al., 2019). Further, these experiences, satisfaction, and outcomes can be improved through the incorporation of domestic features (Foureur et al., 2010; Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014; Mondy et al., 2016; Newburn & Singh, 2003; Nilsson et al., 2020; Rudman et al., 2007). For example, flexible birth rooms that give people the freedom to ambulate and give birth in upright positions can result in fewer epidurals, shorter labors, and fewer caesarean sections and are asso\u0002ciated with fewer babies requiring admission to intensive care (Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013). The tools and furniture in birth rooms that allow free positioning throughout labor and birth contribute to improved outcomes by fostering relaxation and supporting physiologic birth pro\u0002cesses (Hammond et al., 2017; Igarashi et al., 2014; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013; Nilsson et al., 2020). For healthcare providers, improving work\u0002place design in healthcare settings has been shown to reduce stress, enhance safety, produc\u0002tivity, job satisfaction, and quality of care. This includes attention to the layout and configuration of the unit and birth room, the flexibility of the space, light and color, visual and sensory 190 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2) elements, a social room for healthcare providers, and incorporating elements of nature (Setola et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2008). The design of the birth environment has been shown to influence job satisfaction and the way healthcare professionals provide care, which in turn may also impact birth outcomes (Hammond, Foureur, et al., 2014; Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014; Ulrich et al., 2008). Traditional hospital\u0002based birthing units have been identified as some\u0002times being a challenging setting for midwives, as the environment is perceived to be overly medi\u0002calized and not designed to facilitate or support care that optimizes physiologic birth and may even directly hinder it (Foureur et al., 2010; Hammond et al., 2013; Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014). An improved birth unit design, therefore, must support the physical, functional, and psychological needs of midwives to support the provision of quality care and meet the needs of the person giving birth (Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the built environment of the first Cana\u0002dian AMU for midwifery service users, along with the midwives who work there. Our specific objectives were to explore the meanings that individuals attribute to the built environment and to explore how this influences satisfaction with birth space. Method Study Design We conducted an explanatory, sequential mixed methods using a grounded theory methodology. This study was one component of a concurrent, multiphase, mixed-methods evaluation of the AMU, involving both midwives and midwifery service users. Ethics approval was granted by both the Markham Stouffville Hospital (Protocol #78-1808) and Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Boards (Protocol # 5050 and 5056). Sociospatial Conceptual Approach Our study was informed by a sociospatial concep\u0002tual view of the birth environment. From this perspective, the birth environment is defined as not only a physical space but also a place that has meaning and value invested within it by the peo\u0002ple who interact with it. The birth environment is shaped by what is physically in the room, such as the design elements, equipment, and the architecture, but also by broader sociocultural expectations, norms, and influences, which are constructed in part by the thoughts, feelings, and responses of the people who use and interact with the environment (Hammond et al., 2013). We used this approach in developing our research questions and data collection tools. Recruitment and Inclusion Criteria Our study population included midwifery service users and midwives. Everyone admitted to the AMU, including individuals whose care was later transferred to an obstetrician on the L&D unit during the intrapartum period, was eligible to par\u0002ticipate in the study (Figure 1). We recruited these participants during two time periods, September 2018–March 2019 (Phase 1) and September 2018–March 2020 (Phase 2). They completed a consent to contact prior to hospital discharge and a survey link was emailed 2-weeks later. The survey included an invitation to partic\u0002ipate in a follow-up interview conducted by tele\u0002phone. All midwives who attended births at the AMU from January to July 2020 were eligible to participate and were recruited via email. Data Collection Midwifery service users completed an online sur\u0002vey, followed by an individual interview. Mid\u0002wives participated in either an individual interview or a focus group. The survey and inter\u0002view questions for all participants, developed by our research team, explored experiences of the built environment of the AMU, including how they used the space, their satisfaction, and evalua\u0002tion of the equipment available to them. Individ\u0002ual interviews, completed via telephone, and the focus group, conducted in person, were con\u0002ducted by an experienced researcher and audio recorded. We obtained informed consent from all Murray-Davis et al. 191 individuals prior to their participation in all sur\u0002veys, interviews, and focus groups. In keeping with grounded theory approaches, we conducted data analysis concurrently with data collection to facilitate the iterative process of constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Decisions to refine the interview guide were made during peer debriefing meetings and agreed on by the research team. We revised the client Phase 2 survey and interview guide after interim data analysis revealed that the physical environment was an important factor shaping birth experiences. As a result, the Phase 2 survey and the interview guide were modified to include more explicit questions about the impact of the physical environment. We continued recruitment until data saturation was reached and no new data was emerging from the inter\u0002views (Sandelowski, 1995). Data Analysis The data were analyzed sequentially. First, we analyzed the quantitative survey data. Descriptive statistics were used to present the survey data using Microsoft Excel. The Likert scales were Figure 1. Mixed-methods research design. 192 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2) collapsed into a three-point scale (Agree, Neutral, and Disagree) and summarized into percentage proportions. Next, we used grounded theory to analyze our qualitative data. Specifically, data collected from interviews were transcribed verba\u0002tim, read line-by-line, and open coded by three researchers. To ensure reliability between coders, codes were reviewed as a team to ensure agree\u0002ment. We created categories by identifying rela\u0002tionships between related open codes; next, we clustered categories together to form themes (Charmaz, 2003). These themes were used to develop a theoretical model. Triangulation of multiple data sources, methods, and investigators was used to ensure reliability and validity of our findings (Carter et al., 2014). Results Fifty-nine service users completed the survey. Twenty-eight services users and 11 midwives participated in interviews and three midwives participated in one focus group (Figure 1). The majority of midwifery service-user parti\u0002cipants had postsecondary education, earned a total household income above US$100,000 per year, and were similar in age (Table 1). Partici\u0002pants identified as East Asian (8.5%), South Asian (15.3%), White-European (13.6%), and White-North American (47.5%). Due to the small number of midwifery participants, we did not col\u0002lect detailed demographic data to preserve their anonymity; however, most of midwives had worked 3–10 years in healthcare (40.9%) and worked at that hospital between 3 and 10 years (45.5%; Table 2). Quantitative Findings The survey findings indicated that service users were highly satisfied with their experiences in the AMU and with elements of the built environment. Components of their experiences that were rated as highly satisfying included: the check-in/wel\u0002come experience (93.6%), atmosphere (97.9%), physical space (93.4%), the tools and equipment available (83.2%), and the accommodations made for family members (84.0%; Figure 2). In terms of birth equipment, the peanut ball (49.1%), murphy bed (42.4%), and birth chair (37.3%) were used most frequently, while the birth pool (3.4%) and sling (0%) were least frequently used (Figure 3). Qualitative Findings Our interview findings confirmed and expanded on the survey findings and supported the devel\u0002opment of a theoretical model, whereby “making space” for midwifery in the hospital contributed to positive experiences and overall satisfaction with the built environment of the AMU. “Making space” is accomplished through three crucial steps: creating a domestic space in an institutional setting, shifting the technological approach, and sharing ownership of the space (Figure 4). We use “making space” both literally, as the AMU is a separate physical space designed and built in the hospital, and figuratively, as midwives and their service users were given the space, power, and freedom to labor and birth independently accord\u0002ing to midwifery philosophies of care (Figure 5). We review each theme below and participant quotes have been organized by theme in Table 3. Creating a Domestic Space in an Institutional Setting The AMU was designed to look and feel cozy, relaxing, comfortable, and intentionally different from the traditional hospital environment, which participants described as “cold and sterile.” Despite being located within the hospital, the atmosphere, aesthetics, spaciousness, and the ways it supported family members all contributed to the AMU feeling more domestic than institu\u0002tional. The atmosphere was described by mid\u0002wives as being quiet, calm, spa-like, and very welcoming to families. Service users chose similar words to describe the atmosphere and went further to articulate that it felt private and intimate and noted the atmo\u0002sphere was very different from a hospital ward. Multiparous people who had previously given birth on the traditional labor unit noted that the AMU was calmer in comparison. The AMU aes\u0002thetics included soft wall colors, nature murals, artwork, birth affirmations, and soft furniture Murray-Davis et al. 193 (Figure 6). Service users appreciated that the space’s design and aesthetic felt very intentional to support the philosophies of midwifery care. They described how the ambiance, including music and lighting customization, contributed to their comfort and relaxation in the space, feeling strongly that their surroundings impacted their mood and birth experience. Both service users and midwives enjoyed the spaciousness of the AMU and birthing rooms. The AMU was less crowded and busy than the traditional labor unit due to fewer people, fewer visible supplies, and medical equipment, result\u0002ing in more open spaces (Figure 7). The midwives noted that the birthing rooms were free from “clutter”—such as the traditional hospital bed, pumps and preprimed intravenous sets, and most obstetric equipment, making the room feel more spacious. The service users appreciated the sense of space they felt in their room. A major design element of the AMU was to create an environment that felt more like a Table 1.

Service users commonly described the AMU as “the best of both worlds,” meaning the best of homebirth and hospital birth combined. This referred to the abil\u0002ity to have a home-like environment while still being in the hospital, with quick, easy access to obstetrical care if needed, unlike at a planned homebirth. The space also accommodated and supported partners and families through the fam\u0002ily lounge and kitchen, comfortable furniture, and the birthing room being large enough to com\u0002fortably accommodate their presence. Families also expressed feeling welcome in the space by AMU staff, noting that the space was set up to support their involvement in the birthing experience. Overall, the ambiance, aesthetics, and family\u0002orientation created a domestic space that contrib\u0002uted to feelings of comfort and relaxation. Shifting the Technological Approach The design of the AMU moved away from the biomedical and technological focus of childbirth characterized by a reliance on technology. This shift occurred by removing from the birth space much of the technology that was not routinely used. The primary motivation for this was to decrease access to unnecessary equipment and therefore demonstrate respect for judicious rather than routine use of technology. Put simply, if the continuous fetal heart rate monitor is present in the room, it will be used. However, this removal of equipment had two consequences. First, it reduced the amount of unnecessary equipment, Table 2. Demographics of Midwife Participants.

Second, it allowed for the introduction of nontechnology-based labor and birth tools and equipment. For example, since the traditional equipments, such as the fetal heart monitor, obstetric bed, and neonatal warmer. were brought in only when needed, items to sup\u0002port physiologic birth, such as bars, slings, mats, and birth stools, were prioritized and visible. On the traditional labor ward, these tools had previ\u0002ously not been available, not accessible due to space limitations. By comparison, in the purpose-built AMU, these tools and equipment were at the midwife’s fingertips and promoted their use to support physiologic birth (Figure 8). The tools were conveniently located, and they had more of these tools at their disposal than ever before. Service users enjoyed and appreciated the variety of resources available since it gave them more opportunities to find the right tool or posi\u0002tion while coping with contractions. However, some service users felt they needed better educa\u0002tion about the tools, how to use them, how they were beneficial in labor, and at what stages in labor they were helpful. Without this information, clients often refrained from using the equipment at all. For example, some service users reported not knowing about the ability to control the light\u0002ing and music in the room. Overall, both service users and midwives reported that removing and modifying the tech\u0002nology and equipment in the birthing room cre\u0002ated a space that was flexible and usable. Midwives had the ability to remove, move, or add equipment as necessary to accommodate the needs of each individual. The open space facili\u0002tated mobility, freedom of movement, and the ability to use more of the space. A unique design feature of the AMU birth spaces was the replacement of traditional hospital beds with a queen-sized murphy bed that was folded down from the wall only when in use (Figure 9). This shifted the focus away from the bed being the center of the room. The bed was hidden until needed, which provided more space in the room for the client to use, be mobile in, and have family present. The midwives described that ideally the bed would only be used for postpartum recovery, but many service users still expected they would labor and give birth on a bed and desired this experience. Feedback from service users indicated that they appreciated the murphy bed particularly in the postpartum time when they could relax and bond with their baby. They also liked that it was big enough to fit their partner. Not having the bed directly available really rein\u0002forced movement and encouraged service users to try other tools and equipment. However, while there were benefits of this style of bed, it was • Con\u0002nuity of Care Source: (Association of Ontario Midwives (AOM) & Association of Ontario Midwives, 2021)  • • Midwives provide care through pregnancy, labour, birth, and the first six weeks following birth.

It wasn’t too crowded. It allowed me to bring my belongings and allowed me to walk around the room without having to feel like everyone was around me that it was too close, so I liked our actual room, and it was very private and just the perfect size. I am so happy I went through that method, because you really have the comfort and relaxation as if you were in a home setting, but still have the expertise and the team available to you to make everything go smoothly.

So the attempt to mimic a homey type atmosphere, I think, is encouraging to the labour progress itself Shifting the technological approach Service user The birthing rooms were great. The Jacuzzi tubs were great. I laboured in that for a bit. They had bars along the wall to help to squat or whatever and whatnot during contractions. The birthing stool was awesome, the Murphy bed.

It was really accommodating to being in labour I felt. Just having ... the space to really labour in different ways was fantastic. It made it feel not closed in or anything or rushed. It just kind of felt like ... the space was there to use as we needed it, which was great. It felt like our space I think having it being able to kept away gave us that extra space for me to pace and just even allow us labouring in the one spot, just that openness helped Midwife Yeah, it’s a hospital room. Don’t get me wrong. There’s oxygen on the wall, there’s all of that, but there isn’t a lot of clinical equipment. So there isn’t that anxiety that comes right away, I’m in a hospital room with a bed and a warmer and all of those things. It’s all tucked away. It’s all hidden, it’s covered There’s just so many options that the women and the clients, they’re all up to try anything. And it’s almost like the midwives will have a bigger toolbox full of tools that they can use. I mean sterile water, the TENS machine. They can bring the mom and put her in the bathtub or they can do a water birth if they want. There’s so many more tools that we can use It felt like we didn’t really use the entire room before on the other unit, like it was the same space and everything, but I felt like we used half of the room ... whereas now it’s kind of like no, just use the whole thing. Like I find that even, I get them to sit on the chairs that were designated for us and like just anywhere. Live your life anywhere in this room, the whole thing is yours. I see more clients pulling out their personal belongings... pictures and things to make it feel a little bit homier for themselves [O]ne of the outcomes of the physical space, I know has been to encourage more physiological positioning in labour, more upright positioning in births and that is definitely something the way that the physicality of each room is laid out, that it really enables that. Anybody’s who has sort of worked in the birth environment will know that if you bring somebody labouring into a room and there’s a bed there, it’s very easy for that person to just climb into the bed and lay there. But we know that that’s not the best place to labour. So in our rooms, the bed is not immediately visible unless this client is requesting an epidural and we know that that’s in their birth plan and that’s what they’re going to do when they become active in labour. And that’s definitely something that I’ve seen as well. It’s very clear that like clients are more physiological in their labouring rather than sort of gravitating towards a flat surface and lying down For the most part, the Murphy beds are tucked away. They’re there when women need to relax after birth. Or if they need a little rest during labour, they can lie on their side on this Murphy bed that pulls down. But ambulation, upright posture, in a Rebozo sling type device, in the water, all of these approaches to supporting labouring people are well supported by the research literature to help facilitate normal physiologic birth Shared ownership of the space Service user If there’s anything that makes it feel more homey. I brought in a bouquet of flowers, because I love flowers and candles. I had LED candles in there with me just for additional ambient light, because I like low lights and warm lighting, and that always makes me feel more at home (continued) Murray-Davis et al. 199 articulated as not being ideal for perineal suturing due to its low height, which placed ergonomic strain on midwives. Sharing Ownership of the Space We found that all users of the space, service users, midwives, and family described a sense of indi\u0002vidual ownership over the space. For midwives, this stemmed from the space being solely for mid\u0002wifery care and governed and run by midwives. The governance of this space was an important aspect of ownership, as midwives were able to create their own care standards based on evidence-based midwifery approaches to care. Midwives recounted how this facilitated a sense of power and autonomy, knowing that the space was designed specifically to support their Table 3.

And there’s a different feeling when you come onto the floor as opposed to just walking around labour and delivery ... just having a sense of like this is our place and it reflects our philosophy of care [We] have a pantry and the working environment for the midwives, there’s a team room, there’s a kitchen, there’s space for the hospitalists to work. So, to me, that is very reinforcing of validating everyone’s job and everyone’s work there, and making sure that they have space that they call their own Having the ability to change the colour of the lighting and putting on their music, their playlists, their baby playlists, they really like ...they feel safe, they feel comfortable. They’ve made it their own little environment and I think that helps them stay calm, stay relaxed. They can have more interactions with their partners. We let visitors come in and I think that really helps them feel supported as well. And all those things just contribute to progress and for their labour to go well, for them to have a positive experience and a good experience They have no idea what a birth stool is. They’ve probably never heard about it. They don’t know what it’s useful for. They don’t know that it’s going to help them. A lot of them don’t even know about like a birth ball is helpful I find having the couches out of there makes the partner be more involved. And it’s just a chair that’s not super inviting and then having us be in the whole space, it’s like you have to be involved or otherwise you’re just in the corner. Yeah, they’re really engaged and they like all the stuff. They seem to like all the things we have 200 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2) philosophy of care and validated their work. Ser\u0002vice users supported this sentiment, valuing a space that was designed to promote the type of care and birth philosophies they were seeking when choosing midwifery care. Features like the staff room and meeting rooms gave midwives a sense of belonging and camaraderie that had been missing since they had never previously had dedi\u0002cated spaces in the hospital. Those birthing on the unit demonstrated multi\u0002dimensional ownership of the space, by taking control of their physical surroundings and their birth experience. In the birthing room, they had flexibility to modify the space, including the equipment, labor tools, and furniture. They also had the ability to personalize the lighting and music and were encouraged to bring personal items to make the space more comfortable, such as LED candles, pictures, and curated music play\u0002lists. The birthing room was described as a space that became their own, almost an extension of their home. The built environment also facilitated greater ownership over the birth experience. This was achieved by using a variety of birthing tools, hydrotherapy, and movement into various posi\u0002tions for laboring and pushing, and ambulating in the room and in the hallways. Midwifery ser\u0002vice users expressed feeling a sense of control over their experience as a result of having more options. The midwives noted that ownership and customization of the space contributed to relaxa\u0002tion, improved outcomes, and an overall better birth experiences for service users. Finally, family members also shared in this sense of ownership since they were able to be an integral part of the birth experience. All parti\u0002cipants expressed appreciation that families had enough space in the birthing room to settle in and be comfortable, without feeling crowded and that spaces such as the lounge and kitchen accommo\u0002dated families. Additionally, the midwives believed that partners were more involved in labor support on account of the increased space and room for movement. Figure 6.

The findings revealed that the intentional design elements of the unit facilitated positive experiences and contributed to greater satisfaction with the birth experience. We attri\u0002bute these positive experiences to three key ways of “making space” for midwifery-led birth—cre\u0002ating a domestic space in an institutional setting, shifting the technological approach, and sharing ownership of the AMU (Figure 5). These findings contribute to the growing literature advocating for the benefits of evidence-based birth unit design (Berg et al., 2019). Framing these findings within the sociospatial approach, it is clear that the experiences of midwives and service users were not due to the space alone, but how the space was used, which was co-created by every\u0002one who entered the unit, and was underpinned by midwifery philosophies (Figure 5). Our results support previous research, which emphasized the importance of ownership and control in the birthspace (Igarashi et al., 2014; Mondy et al., 2016; Setola et al., 2019). The birth\u0002ing rooms and family lounge contributed to fam\u0002ilies feeling welcomed and involved in the birthing process (Mondy et al., 2016; Nielsen & Overgaard, 2020; Setola et al., 2019). The unit was described as “the best of both worlds,” a similar finding to that of Kuliukas et al. (2016) in a co-located birth center in Australia (Kuliukas et al., 2016). These findings support offering a third option to give birth, as neither home nor traditional hospital may be the optimal fit. The flexibility of the space was a key compo\u0002nent to participants’ satisfaction, making it easier for midwives to fully promote physiological birth and giving birthing people ownership and options (Hammond, Homer, et al., 2014; Setola et al., 2019). It is important that this flexibility was recognized and utilized by both care provider and service users since the birthing environment must meet the needs of everyone in the space (Dana & Wambach, 2003; Setola et al., 2019; Skogstro¨m Figure 9. Double murphy bed. Murray-Davis et al. 203 et al., 2022). In traditional hospital labor wards, midwives often attempted to modify the physical environment to try and make the space more domestic or to facilitate normal birth (Bourgeault et al., 2012; Davis & Homer, 2016; Igarashi et al., 2014) but were constrained by what the space would allow (Mondy et al., 2016). Our findings are in line with those of Hammond et al. (2013), demonstrating that the ways in which midwives use the birth space is impactful, as midwives were more effective at promoting physiologic, low risk birth when working in an environment that supports their professional needs (Hammond et al., 2013). Our findings stress the impact and importance of midwives feeling a sense of ownership and belongingin the birthspace. Previous findings from Bourgeault (2012) found that midwives felt like visitors in labor wards and guests at homebirths and described “borrowing space” that explicitly did not belong to them (Bourgeault et al., 2012). This newfound sense of ownership, belonging and control described by midwives on the unit is an important finding and warrants further research to explore how this impacts practitioner confi\u0002dence, professional identity, and job satisfaction. As now neither a visitor in clients’ homes, nor guest in the labor ward, midwives working on the AMU exist in a liminal space, which Brown et al. (2017) described as phenomena that do not fit into normal categories but fall “betwixt and between.” The unit is neither home, nor hospital, yet has overlapping elements with both. The liminality of the unit is potentially why the space is so effective for clients and midwives, as its flexibility allows the space to be used in whatever ways are needed by clients or their caregivers. The space can become whatever is desired, pro\u0002viding both parties a sufficiently strong internal locus of control to feel a sense of ownership of the space. Its character as neither home nor institu\u0002tion alleviates the risk narrative of home birth, and the flexibility of the space allows for the tenet of choice to be made manifest. Implications for Practice As Canada’s first AMU, this analysis is critical for identifying factors that should be considered when designing future birth spaces to optimize the environment for all. Our model for creating, shifting, and sharing as a way to make space for midwifery approaches can serve as a template for other centers looking at intentional design to pro\u0002mote favorable outcomes and user satisfaction. This model of care and the intentional design of the birth environment may be an important component to midwifery retention, which is an ongoing problem globally. In a recent study in Western Canada, one third of midwives surveyed had seriously considered leaving the profession (Geraghty et al., 2019). The literature thus far has not specifically addressed what impact the phys\u0002ical environment and its association with auton\u0002omy may contribute to midwife job satisfaction and attrition. However, our findings suggest that this type of model may help contribute to better midwifery retention through both cognitive and physical benefits. Decreased stress levels, greater satisfaction at work, and the shift away from hier\u0002archical power structures may address common sources of burnout (Bloxsome et al., 2019; Ger\u0002aghty et al., 2019; Stoll & Gallagher, 2019). There are further implications to using “home\u0002like” as a design goal. From an equity lens, there may be a benefit to the unit having a stereotypical “home-like” aesthetic, as it provides an alterna\u0002tive to homebirth for those who don’t have a home-space that provides the same safety, com\u0002fort, ambiance, and spaciousness as the AMU. Our mixed-methods approach strengthened the study as we were able to confirm our findings through data triangulation. Limitations of the study stem from the fact that we did not collect data from patients with other care providers at the same hospital, nor did we investigate midwifery service user’s experiences in the traditional labor ward prior to the opening of the midwifery unit. Also, our findings may not be generalizable to other communities due to the specific demo\u0002graphics of the midwifery population who participated. Conclusion The built environment of AMU resulted in posi\u0002tive experiences and satisfaction among all parti\u0002cipants. The domestic environment was relaxing 204 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2) and comfortable for those in labor, while still maintaining proximity to emergency care. This purpose-built space designed with equipment and resources to support midwife-led care encouraged flexibility and choice for those giving birth. Finally, the built environment led to a greater sense of ownership for all those giving and receiving care. This went beyond the space and how it is designed, to include how it was used and co-created by midwives, service users, and their families. Implications for Practice \u0002 To optimize the birth environment for all, institutional birth settings should consider incorporating domestic elements and deme\u0002dicalizing the space to promote midwifery approaches to care which support physiolo\u0002gic birth. \u0002 Midwifery ownership and self-governance contribute to how the space is used and co-created with service users. This agency and ownership foster a sense of belonging, which is an important contributor to health\u0002care provider job satisfaction. \u0002 A positive built environment for the birth setting may have a meaningful impact on addressing attrition and retention in the mid\u0002wifery profession through decreased stress and increased job satisfaction. \u0002 Optimizing the birth environment can improve childbirth satisfaction among women and birthing people and their fami\u0002lies. But service users need to be informed about how to optimally interact and make use of the space during the antenatal period.

World Health Organization esti- mates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1). Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2). This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,   learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facili- ties. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health ser- vices, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile cat- egory of users like PwD. It is extremely important to design and build ad- equate structures, properly designed and implemented       as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5). In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inad- equate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residen- tial care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and termi- nally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6). The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,    and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7). Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in so- cial and family patterns. There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the com- ing decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,        Figure 1. The comparison of the bed numbers of LTC between 2010 and 2020 (Eurostat).       that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14). Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many re- searchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related. In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimu- lating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of peo- ple experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).  1.1        Research gap  In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfor- tunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research. There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have. The current model of residential care manage- ment in Italy often appears inadequate to current sce- narios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Non- self-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent sta- tistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of    fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).  2.        Materials and methods  This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research. The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users. A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy. The survey consists of:  1.        identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development) 2.        choice of the most useful way of administer- ing the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition) 3.        processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)  The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare       facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.  2.1        Assessment framework development from the case study analysis  The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the as- pects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were stud- ied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing - thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configura- tion - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were sum- marized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).  2.2        Web-based survey definition  The survey was divided into 4 parts:  1.        The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and in- structions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only. 2.        The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for sta- tistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.    3.        The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question. Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD. The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relation- ship between well-being and PwD, previ- ously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development: -        location, -        shared spaces, -        paths, -        living areas, -        external spaces, -        technologies, -        bedrooms. 4.        In the last part there is an open answer to col- lect other opinions and personal experiences.  2.3. Data collection and analysis  The typology of web-based surveys used fre- quently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible. The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...). It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer. The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then ana- lyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.  3.        Results  The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.       Figure 2. Analysis table for case studies.       The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confi- dence level above 90 percent appears to be statisti- cally valid. The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another el- ement of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solu- tion also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined. This evidence leads back to an important consid- eration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing ser- vice performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces. Another shared aspect is the tendency to pre- fer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in an- other question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most rel- evant. The preference centered on the extensive de- velopment of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.    3.1.        Section 1 – Statistical data  The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondar- ily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) re- lated to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclu- sively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pan- demic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by Socio- Healthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).  Figure 3. The age of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.   Figure 4. The gender distribution of the people who were involved in the questionnaire        Figure 5. The position of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.     Figure 6. The questionnaire results about the location of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.      3.2.        Location  The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hos- pital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital ar- eas. A very small portion believes that the follow- ing is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).   3.3.        General aspects  As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about 10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development. However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.        Figure 7. The questionnaire results about the general idea about the structure of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     3.4.        Distribution  56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8). It is probably less functional or otherwise con- vincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distri- bution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.   3.5.        Living area  The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining com- ponents surveyed is certainly one that leads to a prefer- ence for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9). Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,        Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.    Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.  3.6.        Outdoor space  The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multi- level development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,   such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.  3.7.        Future trends  Green continues to be a need felt by both Manag- ers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a        Figure 11. The opinion about the future of healthcare facilities.    Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.    prominent element in the choice made by interview- ees (Figure 11). This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.   3.8.        Personalization  The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners. In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a       viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compro- mise solution but emphasized the importance of con- sidering how guests can personalize their living spaces.  3.9.        Other considerations  The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback pro- vided by the questionnaire. These can be divided into three main themes:  A)        Issues related to the content: -        I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff; -        In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psy- chology become an increasingly integral part of the design process; -        Single room and private bathroom, free ac- cess to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedi- cated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside; -        I believe that personalizing one’s daily liv- ing spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”; -        A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tui- tion and staff minutes must be taken into consideration; -        Fundamental are aggregation and shar- ing of spaces and activities very important    to understand the background of the el- derly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife; - I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to gener- ate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community; B)        Issues related to the form and process of the survey: -        Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions; -        Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to com- pare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current users- Integration with city/ country communities; C)        Issues related to staff training and education: -        All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the pa- tient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself ); -        Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces; -        It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and       chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.  3.10.        Comparison of the results  The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative com- parison with the data that emerged from the question- naire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical under- standing of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses. Several choices, as previously reported, have re- marked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substan- tial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,    favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various ques- tions. For example, the choice of having shared sociali- zation spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).  4.        Discussion and conclusion  The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This as- pect that emerges from the questionnaire is consist- ent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be to- ward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating out- door spaces on the upper levels in close contact with          Figure 13. The comparison between the results from the Case studies and Questionnaire.       the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the inci- dence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be signifi- cant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed. The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analyt- ical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the con- stants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC en- vironments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.  5.        Research limitations and future developments  The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakehold- ers, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as inter- viewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage    and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many peo- ple and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents. However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.

All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.     ardiac intensive care units (CICUs), in particular, and intensive care units (ICUs), in general,  are considered to be the most complex places in a hospital. CICUs (also called cardiac care  units, acute coronary care units, or critical coronary care units) provide special, systematic,  team-based critical care to patients recovering from cardiac surgeries and patients with severe  cardiovascular diseases (CVDs—serious or life-threatening heart conditions such as heart attacks,  acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure) and complications such as renal failure  and respiratory issues (Loughran et al. 2017). Like CVDs, health conditions treated in ICUs are often  the leading causes of deaths as well as elevated healthcare costs in the United States and other countries  (e.g., Bowry et al. 2015; Dasta et al. 2005).  Intensive care medicine was developed over 60 years ago and has evolved in order to better  manage critical ill patients through temporarily supporting or replacing the functions of major  organ systems (Kelly et al. 2014). However, hospitals face several challenges, including hospitalacquired infections, patient falls, and nurse back pain and injury, in intensive care. These safety  and quality issues may lead to negative patient outcomes, increased mortality, and waste of precious resources. The successful management of these issues constitutes a key component of the successful delivery of intensive care.  ICUs are specialized healthcare settings that require high levels of staffing and intensive use  of technology and other resources. Because of the high acuity levels and complex conditions,  patients in CICUs and ICUs require continuous and close monitoring by clinicians with special  training (Kasaoka 2017). As a result, the staff-to-patient ratio is much higher in these units than  typical medical–surgical care units. Furthermore, many types of specialized technological  equipment (e.g., electrocardiography, intra-aortic balloon pump, mechanical ventilator) are used  in intensive care for patient monitoring and treatment (Kasaoka 2017). In addition, patient  1  Corresponding Author: Ahmad E.

Hooked up to wires and tubes, patients typically spend several days to several weeks in ICUs  with limited awareness of their surroundings (Katz et al. 2010). All the aforementioned unique  features of intensive care should be thoroughly considered in the process of quality improvement  aiming at reducing costs, improving healthcare outcomes, and enhancing patient experience.  Role of the Physical Environment in Healthcare  The physical environment of ICUs may play a significant role in improving healthcare safety and  quality. An increasing number of research studies published in many disciplines (e.g., medicine,  nursing, building design, engineering) have clearly demonstrated the critical effects of the physical environment on key patient and staff outcomes, including healthcare-associated  infections (HAI), patient falls, medical errors, patient anxiety, pain, patient satisfaction, job  satisfaction, work efficiency, and work-related injuries (Ulrich et al. 2004, 2008).  Much healthcare environment design research has been conducted in ICUs; therefore, their  findings may be directly applied to ICU design. For example, single-bed rooms were found to be associated with significant reduction of respiratory, urinary tract, and catheter-related infections as well  as length of stay in a pediatric ICU (Ben-Abraham et al. 2002). Another recent study compared two ICUs and found that patients younger than 65 years were less likely to experience delirium in the unit  with single rooms and windows than in the other unit that featured windowless multibed rooms  (Arenson et al. 2013). In a coronary critical care unit (CCU), researchers found that the installation of sound-absorbing ceiling tiles led to shortened reverberation times and improved speech intelligibility  as well as reduction in staff members’ self-reported work demands and strain (Blomkvist et al. 2005).  Findings from a variety of other healthcare settings may also be adapted to inform ICU design  decision-making or design innovation. For example, a study conducted in outpatient medical offices  indicated a positive correlation between environmental attractiveness and higher levels of perceived  quality, satisfaction, and staff interaction and lower patient anxiety (Becker and Douglass 2008). The installation of ceiling lifts in an extended care facility significantly reduced staff injuries related to patient handling, days lost, workers’ compensation claims, and direct costs associated with patient  handling injuries (Chhokar et al. 2005). Visual artworks were found to help reduce the anxiety and  agitation of psychiatric patientsin a mental health facility (Nanda et al. 2011).  These research efforts have resulted in substantial increases of the amount and quality of evidence that should be continuously tracked and applied in practice to maximize the benefits for  patients, families, staff, and healthcare organizations.  Translating Research Evidence into Design Innovations  Evidence-based design (EBD) is a process of environmental design that utilizes credible research  evidence and methodology to improve outcomes (The Center for Health Design, n.d.). EBD is an example of translational research that facilitates the application of research findings by creating  design resources and tools that meet practical needs. It addresses the disconnect between research  and design often observed in the environmental design field. The disconnect partially originates  from the fact that peer-reviewed research journal articles published in medicine and other  scientific disciplines are difficult for many design professionals to access and understand. To address this problem, many extensive literature reviews have been conducted in recent years on various EBD topics to make the research knowledge readily available to practitioners. Examples  include a comprehensive review conducted by Ulrich et al. (2008) on all environmental elements  that impact healthcare outcomes, a systematic review focusing on long-term residential care  facilities (Joseph, Choi, and Quan 2015), and a systematic review on how maternity room design  may impact maternal and neonate outcomes (Nilsson et al. 2020). However, it remains a challenge  to periodically update the reviews and stay current with the latest developments in research.  62 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH Another potential cause of the gap between research and design is the lack of easy-to-use EBD  resources and tools as well as compelling EBD examples that show how research findings from different sources may be integrated to create design solutions or innovations that significantly  contribute to the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery. One example of design  resources is the “Guidelines for Intensive Care Unit Design” developed by a multidisciplinary team  on the basis of research evidence and expert knowledge (Thompson et al. 2012). Another type of effort is the development of prototypes for healthcare environments that visually demonstrate all  relevant EBD features, which would effectively speed up the translational research. This research  study is one step toward developing such a prototype of evidence-based CICU design.  Aim of the Study  This research study aimed to develop a set of key EBD considerations for a prototype (3Dimensional) CICU that would promote patient health and safety while reducing staff stress and  fatigue. As the first step in developing the prototype, a literature review was conducted to update  previous reviews by examining the most recent research around ICU environments.  Research Question  What are the main environmental design features that promote patients’ health and safety in the CICU?  Methodology  The literature review process involved three main steps: establishment of a conceptual  framework, literature search, and literature analysis and synthesis.  Conceptual Framework  The conceptual framework for EBD developed by Ulrich et al. (2010) was adopted to guide the  literature search and review. In this framework, the built environment design variables are  classified into nine categories:  ▪ Audio environment (e.g., sound-absorbing characteristics of finishes, acoustic walls) ▪ Visual environment (e.g., windows, building orientation) ▪ Safety enhancement (e.g., staff visual access to patients, handwashing sinks) ▪ Wayfinding system (e.g., building entrance, signage) ▪ Sustainability (e.g., building mass, building envelope) ▪ Patient room (e.g., single room, same-handed layout) ▪ Family support spaces (e.g., overnight bed in patient room) ▪ Staff support spaces (e.g., decentralized nurse station, proximity of supplies) ▪ Physician support spaces (e.g., operating room, air quality, lighting) These design variables directly impact healthcare participant outcomes, including patient outcomes  (e.g., hospital-acquired infections, sleep quality, length of stay), family outcomes (e.g., quality of communication, stress, satisfaction), physician and other staff outcomes (e.g., work performance,  perceived fatigue), and organizational outcomes (e.g., cost, revenue). The relationships between design  variables and outcomes are mediated by confounding factors, including demographics and  organizational factors such as culture, occupancy rate, and nurse-to-patient ratio.  Literature Search  A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. The methodology of conducting research  from the literature review involved the thematic approach, in which credible scholarly journal articles  focusing on the physical environment’s impacts on patients and nurses in CICUs were searched and  reviewed. An initial search of the literature was conducted using several databases, including Google  Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. The criteria for inclusion included the following:  63 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN  ▪ Empirical research articles published in peer-reviewed journals ▪ English language ▪ Publication between 2000 and 2019 ▪ Evidence on connections between environment design and healthcare outcomes that potentially can be used to inform ICU design A list of keywords, including design variables (e.g., layout, lighting) and outcomes (e.g., infections,  patient falls), adapted from the conceptual framework was used in the literature search. Additional  articles were extracted from relevant literature reviews that were conducted previously. The  abstracts and full-text articles were examined to eliminate those that did not meet the criteria for  inclusion. The process resulted in a short list of relevant articles for further analysis.  Data Extraction and Synthesis  The shortlisted studies were transferred from the source databases to Excel, and then the  publication information was documented in Excel. The researchers reviewed all the study  findings. Finally, forty-four research articles (various types, including original research, literature  review, methodology, and expert consensus) found to be relevant met the requirements of the  review and the aim of this study. The included articles were reviewed twice by the researchers  for relevance, and their contents were first extracted and then analyzed and synthesized. The  credibility of the research evidence was evaluated according to widely accepted criteria of empirical research (e.g., Pati 2011). Different aspects of design were coded to generate themes,  and related concepts were clustered together under the emerged themes.  Results An ICU typically contains a variety of spaces (e.g., patient rooms, workstations, corridors) for different user groups. This section first summarizes the design considerations applicable to all  spaces and then focuses on recommendations for the spaces used only by a specific group of users— patients, families, or staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, and other staff). See the complete list  in Table 1. The last part includes the recommendations around the design process of considering the  relevant factors and integrating multiple features into the best design solution.

physical environment plays a critical role in enhancing healthcare safety (Joseph, Henriksen,  and Malone 2018; Olmsted 2016). An important design consideration for healthcare environments  such as ICUs that impacts not only safety but also work efficiency is the visual sightline connection  between various spaces (e.g., workstations and patient rooms). In a qualitative study conducted by Pati, Harvey, and Pati (2014), visibility was reported by healthcare professionals as one of the top  issues around emergency department (ED) safety and efficiency. Several key visibility design  recommendations may be applicable to ICU design: locating the unit entrance in the direct sightline  of reception and security, providing visual connection between different clinical work zones, and  designing unit layout (e.g., corridor shape, workstation location) to maximize visibility from workstations to patient rooms (Pati, Harvey, and Pati 2014). Physicians and nurses reported that  greater levels of visibility led to increased productivity and teamwork efficiency, and contributed to higher security (Gharaveis et al. 2018). 66 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH One of the goals of improving visibility for patient monitoring isto reduce patient falls, which  poses a serious challenge in ICUs and may result in injuries, extended hospitalization, and high  costs. However, there is no single “silver bullet” for fall prevention, and a multifaceted solution  that includes education, communication, environment, and medication should be used to minimize the incidence of falls and injuries (Rowe 2013). Among environmental factors, certain  flooring, such as carpets, may help reduce patient’s fear of falling, incidence of falls, and severity  of injuries related to falls (Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). A  retrospective analysis of patient fall reports revealed several environment contributors of patient  falls: uneven floor surfaces, poor nighttime lighting, and limited visibility for surveillance  (Bayramzadeh, Portillo, and Carmel-Gilfilen 2019).  HAIs are infections that people acquire when they are receiving healthcare services. HAIs may  cause high morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay and suffering, rehospitalization, high  costs, and dissatisfaction (Ulrich et al. 2008). The following design features have been found in research as contributors to HAI prevention: physical separation between patients (e.g., single-bed  rooms with private bathrooms), accessible hand hygiene sinks and gel dispensers, high-efficiency air  disinfection and filtration, interior finish materials that are easy to clean and maintain (Nanda, Malone,  and Joseph 2012; Ulrich et al. 2008). A 2006 study found that vinyl flooring was more durable and  easier to maintain as well as produced lower VOC emissions (Lankford et al. 2006). Medication errors are preventable mistakes in the process of medication use (e.g., preparing,  dispensing, and administration) that could potentially cause harms to patients. Research has found that  medication errors could be reduced by providing high-illumination task lighting and reducing  unexpected noises in staff work zones (Ulrich et al. 2008). Dedicated medication rooms should provide  adequate spaces for staff members with minimal disruptions (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011;  Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). Acuity-adaptable rooms were designed to accommodate patients  through different levels of care; therefore, they may help reduce the necessity of intra-hospital  transfers—a source of medical errors (Hendrich, Fay, and Sorrells 2004). Security, or the prevention of violence, is an important subset of healthcare safety. It turns  out that visibility also significantly impacts security. As Gharaveis et al. (2018) found, staff  members recommended visual surveillance over the unit entry as well as open layout and  decentralization that facilitated undisrupted sightlines. Additional design features recommended  for security included traffic management (e.g., one-way traffic) and dedicated areas for special  populations (e.g., mental health patients) (Gharaveis et al. 2018; Pati, Pati, and Harvey 2016).  Visual Environment  Patients in ICUs often experience negative mood states such as anxiety and fear. The ICU visual  and audio environment constitutes an important factor determining patient physical (e.g., sleep  disturbances) and psychological experiences (e.g., anxiety, depression; see Topçu et al. 2017).  Appropriate visual stimuli should be incorporated in the environmental design to speed up recovery  by alleviating the negative moods. The provision of positive distractions and natural daylight has  been found to effectively reduce stress and improve outcomes (e.g., better sleep at night, faster  recovery). High levels of daylight (as measured by the daylight factor—the ratio of the daylight  level inside a building to the daylight level outside) were associated with a shorter length of stay in a U.S. hospital and a Korean hospital (Choi 2004). Nature images with sky and trees generated  higher ratings in perceived pleasantness and activated brain regions associated with general positive  feelings, as shown in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Pati et al. 2014).  Simulated nature scenes presented on ceiling-mounted fixtures may provide frontal exposure of nature to patients in a supine position. Research found that such positive distractions significantly  improved patients’ satisfaction with the room environment and reduced their blood pressure levels  (Pati et al. 2014). Data also showed the potential benefits of this intervention in reducing anxiety,  pain, and medication use (Pati et al. 2016a). Nurses’ exposure to nature views (through windows  67 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN  accessible from work areas) was associated with significant reductions in acute stress and increases  in alertness (Zadeh et al. 2014). In addition, the visual appeal (i.e., attractiveness) of the built  environment was found to impact a healthcare facility’s public image and make it easy to recruit  physicians and other staff members (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016).  Furthermore, research is beginning to shed light on other visual design topics. For example, a  team led by Pati et al. (2016b) examined the effects of curved and pointed sharp-angled features in healthcare building images on fear responses as measured by amygdala activation in fMRI brain  scans and self-reported preferences of healthy adults. Overall, the study participants reported high  preferences for images with curved objects. However, brain scans indicated significantly higher fear  response associated with curve contours in healthcare interiors (Pati et al. 2016b). Audio Environment  In busy environments like an ICU, noise is a serious problem that causes sensory overload, stress,  sleep disruptions, dissatisfaction, interferences with oral communication, and low work efficiency  (Devlin and Arneill 2003). Effective noise reduction measures include the use of sound-absorbing  materials such as carpets in patient rooms and corridors, and the location of potential noise sources,  such as paper towel dispensers and ice machines, away from the patient rooms (Devlin and Arneill  2003; Harris and Detke 2013; Nanda, Malone, and Joseph 2012). One effective example of patient  room design for noise reduction included a “technical corridor” behind the patient head to house  noise-generating medical equipment with a sound-blocking wall between the space and patient  head; the environmental modification significantly reduced ICU room noise level, especially at night (Luetz et al. 2016). In addition to noise reduction, the audio environment can be improved  through the provision of relaxing music and nature sounds (Devlin and Arneill 2003; Ulrich et al.  2008). Patient control of environmental elements, such as television volumes, may enhance the  sense of control—a central component of patient-centered care (Devlin and Arneill 2003). Wayfinding System  The difficulty in finding one’s way without getting lost has been a chronic problem in healthcare  facilities that are typically large and complex. The wayfinding issues may cause stress, frustration,  and fatigue in patients and visitors as well as waste in staff time due to late or missed  appointments. Pati et al. (2015) conducted a qualitative study to identify key physical environment elements that may play a critical role in assisting wayfinding. Ten adults were  instructed to complete simulated wayfinding tasks in hospitals. Data was collected through  questionnaire surveys, verbal protocols that aimed at catching every thought occurring during  navigation, and verbal directions provided by staff members. The study identified a set of wayfinding design elements, including the following (Pati et al. 2015):  ▪ Signs, including the labels of rooms or spaces, directional signs, and any images, logos,  or symbols indicating space functions  ▪ Information cues provided by architectural features, including views of exterior and  multilevel interior views provided by atriums  ▪ Maps illustrating the global structure of the building  ▪ Logical clustering of spaces with related functions (e.g., entrance and admissions)  ▪ Furniture that may suggest the functions of spaces  ▪ Interior elements (artwork, display boards, information counters, wall color, vending  machine, etc.) that could serve as familiarity markers of the anchor points  These recommendations are consistent with those of other relevant research studies (e.g.,  Devlin 2014). 68 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH Patient Room One hot debate topic in healthcare design is whether patients should be cared in single-bed units  or open bays. Research has strongly recommended single-bed patient rooms because of the  associated benefits in communication, infection prevention, noise reduction, sleep quality, and  patient and family experiences (Taylor, Card, and Piatkowski 2018).  Beyond the issue of single-bed versus multibed rooms, research has also looked into other topics  such as the relationships between different components of a patient room. In a simulation study of two  ICU mock-up rooms, Chisholm et al. (2008) identified several design considerations: (1) using ceilingmounted articulating arms (i.e., booms) that provided easy access to outlets and equipment and at the  same time reduced clutter, (2) positioning the patient monitors to improve visibility and usability, (3) maximizing clearance around the bed to increase accessibility of equipment and avoid collisions, and  (4) using easy-to-use intercom systems to facilitate communication between nurse stations and ICU  rooms. Similarly, the size of spaces (e.g., patient room size, doorway width) was perceived by hospital  administrators as an important factor that impacted healthcare safety and work efficiency (Pati, Gaines,  and Valipoor 2016). Adequate spaces should be provided for the use and storage of all equipment that  may be used in intensive care (e.g., physiologic monitoring, ventilator) (Department of Veterans  Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012). In another study, Pati et al. (2009) examined the importance of various patient room layout  design elements as perceived by nine designers and five nondesigners (clinicians, patient, family  member, nursing educator). The top-ranked design considerations included spatial clearance  around bed, access to patient (including patient’s head), staff’s visibility to patient, unobstructed  and quick path for staff to access patient from corridor, and patient access to bathroom. The  fourteen participants were then instructed to rate six room configurations that varied on three key  design variables: same-handedness (i.e., same-handed vs. mirrored layout), the location of bathroom in relation to the exterior wall and corridor (i.e., outboard, inboard, and a combination  of the two), and the location of bathroom in relation to the patient (i.e., footwall vs. headwall).  The results showed that outboard and footwall bathroom locations were rated relatively higher  than other options (Pati et al. 2009).  To examine the environmental factors contributing to falls, Pati et al. (2018) analyzed the  videotapes of 180 trials in which subjects were instructed to act as patients and perform scripted  tasks of unassisted ambulation (e.g., walking from bed to bathroom) in a physical mock-up of patient room. The coding of video data showed that certain actions (e.g., turning, pulling, pushing,  bending forward, grabbing, and sitting) contributed to fall initiation. The following physical  environment elements might impact the likelihood of engaging in the aforementioned high-risk  actions and contribute to falls: (1) bathroom door type and direction of swing, (2) bathroom layout  (e.g., spatial relationships between door, toilet, and sink), (3) hardware design (e.g., door, toilet),  (4) clearance within the clinician zone, and (5) clearance around patient bed (e.g., spatial  relationships between bed, chair, overbed table, and bathroom door) (Pati et al. 2018).  Additionally, the installation of video surveillance systems in patient rooms might be an effective  fall-reduction intervention (Cournan, Fusco-Gessick, and Wright 2018).  The safety and efficiency of intensive care could potentially be improved through  standardization on the basis of lessons learned from other industries. While standardization may  occur at a wide range, from furniture or equipment to the whole unit, same-handed room  represents an example of standardization at the level of patient room design. Pati et al. (2010)  further examined the effects of the same-handed room concept in a simulated study, during which  the activities of twenty registered nurses performing tasks (i.e., taking vitals, suctioning, sitting  up patients) on a patient-actor were videotaped and analyzed. However, data provided little support to the notion that nurses should consistently position on the patient’s right side. It was  suggested that same-handed room configurations might not lead to more standardization in process and workflow than the standard mirrored design of patient rooms (Pati et al. 2010).  69 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTONIC, SPATIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN  Biomechanics data from the same study indicated that 87 percent of the harmful and stressful  actions (e.g., twisting, bending) during nursing care were associated with the use of equipment  (e.g., bed, headwall); only 13 percent were related to room configuration issues (e.g., location of IV pole, approach direction). This finding suggested that room layout standardization alone might  not effectively improve the biomechanics of nursing care, and consequently, may be limited in reducing the risk of staff back and musculoskeletal injuries (Pati et al. 2012). Another recent study  showed several benefits of same-handed room, including lower noise, better sleep, and higher  satisfaction; however, other differences between the same-handed rooms and the mirrored rooms  were not controlled in the study (Watkins et al. 2011).  Family Support Spaces  Patient rooms are where visiting family members spend the most time with patients to provide  physical, emotional, and social support. According to a questionnaire survey conducted by Philips  (2012), the interactions between patients and their families would be enhanced through the  provision of seating and sleeping accommodations, personal storage spaces, shelving to display  personal items (e.g., gifts, flowers), accessible lighting and television, sound-absorbing finish  materials, and appropriate furniture design (e.g., movable chairs) in the patient and family zones  that supported family–patient interactions (Philips 2012). Similarly, interviews with four families  of pediatric patients at CICUs and ICUs revealed several design recommendations to support  families: layout that allowed easy communication between family and patient (e.g., shorter  distance, direct visual contact); movable furniture (e.g., chair, overbed table); dedicated shower  and toilet so families could stay close to patients; noise and light control (e.g., blocking of light  from corridor, removing alarms from rooms); access to electric outlets, wireless connection,  television, and other technology; and a communication board with plenty of information for  families (Evans and Thomas 2011). Additional amenities for families should be provided in the  unit. These amenities could include family lounge near patient rooms, communication  technology, consultation rooms, meditation spaces, sleeping rooms, nourishment, bathrooms, and  family laundry (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012).  Staff Support Spaces  The decentralized nursing model is designed to bring nurses and supplies closer to patients by distributing multiple nurse workstations across one unit. It is believed that decentralization may help  improve visibility for patient monitoring and assistance as well as reduce staff walking distance, and  therefore, increase the proportion of time spent by nurses in direct patient care. However, research  on the decentralized design has reported mixed results. For example, a study found that nurses spent  more time on administrative tasks (e.g., charting) but also engaged in more social interactions and  consulting with other clinicians in units with centralized workstation design (Zborowsky et al.  2010). In a before–after study, nurses spent less time in fetching supplies, and therefore, worked  more efficiently after they moved from nursing units with centralized nurse stations to new units  with decentralized nurse stations, but their walking distance increased and the self-reported  collaboration level decreased (Pati et al. 2015). Other empirical studies showed similar patterns:  decentralized nursing stations tended to improve patient experience but impede nurse teamwork  (Fay, Cai, and Real 2019). Another study reported that the centralized design interfered with  communication between staff and access to patients (Pati, Gaines, and Valipoor 2016). Because of the mixed results associated with decentralized design, researchers explored other design options.  For example, a recent study evaluated the effects of a “multihub” design that combined central  nursing hubs and decentralized charting alcoves (Hua et al. 2012). Although patient satisfaction  appeared to increase after the movement from hospital units with centralized or decentralized  designs to the “multihub” unit, nurse satisfaction and nurse communication with physicians failed  to improve or even declined (Hua et al. 2012).  70 Downloaded by ProQuest Content on Thu Dec 01 2022 at 18:33:35 PM CST ALANSARI AND QUAN: DESIGNING A CICU BY EMPLOYING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN APPROACH According to reports from healthcare managers and frontline staff members, additional  design features that support staff work include adequate spaces for the storage, use, and  movement of equipment; ergonomic design (e.g., ceiling lift) that reduces risk of injury and  improves efficiency; and an in-unit staff break room that is visually appealing (Pati et al. 2014).  Additionally, there should be on-call spaces for staff to take short naps and sleep breaks,  restrooms, and lockers next to the staff break room (Thompson et al. 2012). Adequate spaces  should be provided for housekeeping rooms, clean workrooms, and soiled workrooms  (Department of Veterans Affairs 2011; Thompson et al. 1995, 2012).  Integration of Multiple Design Features and Organizational Factors  Healthcare outcomes represent consequences of the interactions between many factors from various  domains, including environmental design, operations, culture, and finance (Pati 2020; Ulrich et al.  2010). Through semistructured interviews, gaming, and shadowing, Pati et al. (2012) examined the  organizational factors that impacted design decisions around flexibility (e.g., decentralized design,  visibility). These factors included performance benchmarks, information technology, regulations,  staff’s reluctance to adopt new technology, doctors’ expectations, human factors (e.g., perception,  cognition), and financial factors (e.g., capital and personnel costs). A systematic approach that  integrates all these factors (e.g., efficiency benchmarks for pharmacy, materials, and nursing unit) and  design considerations (e.g., locations of nurse supplies) should be used to achieve the best possible  outcomes (Pati et al. 2012). It has been recommended that multivariate models such as moderator and  mediator models (i.e., models that include variables that impact or explain the relationship between a  predictor and an outcome) should be developed and tested to optimize multifaceted solutions (Pati  2020). A series of design tools (e.g., balanced scorecard, process analysis) can be used in the nonlinear  iterative design process to discover the best options (Joseph et al. 2012). The design of an ICU involves careful consideration of all key decision variables and  constraints, such as model of care, service lines, budget, and existing structures. These  considerations form the basis for determining the relatively higher priority goals for a building  project and resolving possible conflicts between different design features. Ritchey and Pati (2008) proposed a structured decision-making approach that aimed at balancing various goals and finding  the “sweet spot” or the best design solution. They recommende     The Hospital Minero (Miner Hospital) in Real del Monte,  in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico), is a building complex  conceived, built, and operationalized at the height  of Mexico’s Industrial Revolution. Utilizing historical  analysis, the hospital reveals contradictions frequently  embodied by the era’s Modernist built environments. On  one hand, the hospital’s design and operation expressed  an optimism wrought by the dissemination of positivist  and utilitarian philosophies and economic growth  spurred by technological innovation; on the other hand,  the design expressed growing wealth inequality and  deteriorating, often brutal, labor conditions. Nearly 120  years later, the hospital once again embodies its global  reality. In contemporary post-industrialist economies,  once these built environments cease being productive,  they are abandoned or demolished; only a few are  transformed and repositioned for other uses. Most  recently, the Miner Hospital, an architectural expression  which fused global and local economic, technological,  and aesthetic sensibilities, was transformed into the  Museum of Labor Medicine (Museo de Medicina  Laboral), an example of didactic heritage. On February 12, 1906, the United States Smelting  Refining and Mining Company (USSRMC) purchased  the Compañia Real del Monte y Pachuca’s (CRMyP), its  mines and claims, marking a convergence of specific  geographic conditions, and hundreds of years of  geopolitical and economic factors. Located in Hidalgo,  CRMyP was the latest acquisition in a global purchasing  spree that included mining interests in Peru, Russia,  Canada, and across the United States. Optimistic  about the company’s financial future because of newly  introduced technology, particularly electrically powered  machinery, the company began operations by replacing  outdated technology and reducing dependency  on human labor. Consequently, mine productivity  dramatically increased; however, so did the number of  miners brutally injured or killed during work shifts.  Immersed in the period’s sociopolitical and economic  tensions, the USSRMC and local miners sought a  reconciliatory approach, partnering to build a then  state-of-the-art hospital, Hospital Minero de Real del  Monte, to serve the miners’ medical needs. Nearly 100  years later, after being abandoned, the hospital became  part of Mexico’s tangible heritage when it was converted  into a didactic museum, the Museo de Medicina Laboral  (Museum of Labor Medicine). Today, visitors to the  museum can not only learn about Mexico’s mining  history, early twentieth-century medical technology,  and the brutal conditions that helped give birth to the  country’s labor rights movement, but also confront the  contradiction between Modernism’s promise of progress  and the realities wrought by scientific innovation and a  market-driven global economy.  1.2. Development Plan First, the essay situates the hospital within a  philosophical, sociopolitical, and economic context  across a regional and global scale. It includes Real del  Monte’s geography, mining legacy and cultural history,  to explain how the hospital was conceived at the height  of the region’s mining productivity. Subsequently, the  essay analyzes the development of the hospital’s design,  construction, and operation to demonstrate how the  hospital revealed, and later the museum’s curated  collection (including the buildings themselves) exhibits,  various Modernist ideas derived from Modernism. Next,  the case study documents within a larger sociopolitical  and economic context, why the hospital, was first  ceded to the public sector, then abandoned, and finally  transformed into a museum. Currently, as part the  region’s built heritage, the museum maintains itself by  commodifying a historical narrative forged by globally  influenced, but site-specific, regional economic realities.  1.3. Theoretical Framework This essay utilizes Perry Anderson’s argument that  Modernism is not defined by a singular philosophy  or aesthetic approach, but rather as a historical  movement that disrupted older sociocultural norms  and possessed a sense of urgency (1984, 112-13). One  strain of Modernism, rooted in French positivism and  British utilitarianism philosophies, promoted rationalist  scientific processes to identify and address a range of  social, economic, and technological challenges. For its  part, Modernist architecture “grappled” with this strain  of Modernism, by engaging in its “discourse” through  spatial expressions (Goldhagen 2005, 145).  As countries embraced, or were subjected to, globalized  trade and industrialization, these philosophies,  generating Modernist built environments across the  world, like the hospital, which embodied the era’s  zeitgeist and its intrinsic aporic contradictions. Because  as Sophie Forgan argues museum “[b]uildings are  artefacts in themselves, created at considerable expense  and reflecting the intellectual and material context of  the society in which they were founded,” it is possible  to examine the museum’s spatial identity through a  material culture lens (2005, 574). Where spatial identity  is a “perceived image” produced by aesthetic and  functional characteristics, which generate recognizable  spatial expressions (Rogers, Castree, and Kitchin 2013).  Today’s museum, seen as an iteration of a continuous  spatial history, memorializes multiple, but convergent,  spatial identities: site specific conditions, i.e., climate,  topography, and geology, informed by local, regional,  and global, technological, sociopolitical, and economic  22 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org forces, to produce a built environment that embodied  its then contradictory realities. Today, the museum is  part of the region’s tangible heritage precisely because  visitors can experience how the hospital embodied, and  now the museum exhibits, Modernism’s aporic zeitgeist. 1.4. Methodology The essay examines the Museo de Medicinal Laboral as  a case study that cross-references quantitative data, i.e.,  mining production and market values, with qualitative  spatial analyses. Methodologies include the use of  primary and secondary sources: Primary research was  undertaken through on-site visits and consultation  of primary ¬¬¬documentation, i.e., cotemporaneous  periodicals, advertisements, corporate prospectuses,  financial reports, trade journals, and other archival  sources associated with the historic period. In addition,  museum patrons and staff, including those who oversee  its day-to-day operations, as well as members of the  Archivo Histórico y Museo de Minería, Asociación Civil  (AHMMAC), were interviewed. Secondary sources  include peer-reviewed journal articles, booklets, books,  blogs, contemporary newspaper articles, and other  published material focused on the museum. 2. CONTEXT 2.1. Geography To fully understand how a mining hospital embodies a  confluence of geographic, economic, social, and political  forces, it is important to examine the local, regional, and  national context in which the hospital was conceived.  The establishment of Real del Monte (hereafter Real)  about 70 km northeast of Mexico City, can be traced  to mining-related activities during the pre-Hispanic  period.1  The town’s approximately 11,150 residents live  nestled in the Sierra Pachuca Range, situated 2,718 m  above sea level, where temperatures occasionally dip  below 0˚C generating light, but infrequent, snowfall  during the winter, in a transitional area between  the western slopes of the mineral-rich Sierra Madre  Oriental and the eastern edge of the Central Mexican  Plateau (PueblosAmerica 2022, para. 1) (Figure 1). Like  the rest of Hidalgo, Real and its surrounding region lacks  significant groundwater sources. Though rainfall can  be acutely heavy, it is highly sporadic and confined to  the summer months. Thus, major hydraulic, food and  power infrastructure was required for a larger longterm population settlement. Real’s biome is typical  of a transitional topography with xeriscapes hosting  depleted forests. Over the last 500 years, surrounding  forests were directly decimated by the mining industry  which used wood for construction materials, i.e., mine  rafters and wall blocking, and for fuel; and indirectly, by  1 Officially renamed Mineral del Monte after Mexico’s  independence in 1821. using wood in the construction of the town’s changing  built environment as it accommodated changes in urban  scale, physiognomy, and morphology.  2.2. Pre-Hispanic and Viceregal Era Real’s region was a well-known mountain pass utilized  by several Mesoamerican cultures, including the  Toltecs, Chichimecs, and Otomí. The Otomí christened  the area Maghotsi, or Paso Alto (High Pass), because it  was routinely used to cross from the Gulf of Mexico’s  coast to the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlan (Gobierno  del Estado de Hidalgo 2010, 10). As early as 1324, the  Chichimecs were mining silver and other minerals  throughout the Sierra Pachuca area (7).  In 1531, ten years after the Spanish conquered the  Mexica Empire, the Spanish Crown officially recognized  the region’s potential mineral wealth and placed the  region and its inhabitants directly under the Crown’s  purview, thereby acquiring the Real (Royal) name. Then  in 1552, Alonso Pérez de Zamora, a former soldier in  Hernán Cortés’ army, began mining operations; and  shortly after, in 1555, Bartolomé de Medina would  perfect the mercury-based “patio” method for silver and  gold extraction, greatly increasing yields (Mendizábal  1941, 255).  2.3. Foreign Investment Like most newly incorporated innovative technologies,  initial applications maximized yields, even for  mines previously considered exhausted; yet, like  all technologically driven cycles, subsequent yields  inevitably dropped as technology reached extraction  capacity limit. Real was a profitable mining region during  the Viceregal period, especially after 1750, when owner  Pedro de Romero and Terreros (1710-81) introduced  Figure 1. Central Mexican Plateau, courtesy Google Earth,  January 7, 2022. 23 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org new water-management techniques that generated a  silver mining bonanza. Significantly, in 1766, the first  labor strike erupted in New Spain when miners led by  Nicolás Zavala (the museum’s cultural center namesake)  protested unfair wages and working conditions. Only  with Viceroy Joaquín de Montserrat’s (in office 176066) direct intervention did miners return to work. By the  last years of the eighteenth century, however, the mines  had been abandoned, as decreasing profits no longer  justified operational costs (Mendizábal 1941, 305).  In 1824, when the Mexican government allowed  for foreign investment, the British Real del Monte  Company, based out of London, purchased the Romero  de Terreros’ mines and claims and established the  Compañía de Aventureros de las Minas de Pachuca y  Real del Monte in Mexico. British investors, engineers,  administrators, and miners, most hailing from Cornwall,  sought to apply cutting-edge steam-powered mining  technology to exploit Real’s mines. From 1824 to  1849, the British invested 16 million dollars to produce  11 million dollars of market-value ore. Arguably, the  venture failed because of a strained relationship with  the Federal government, six crippling labor strikes,  expensive equipment, e.g., Cornish pumps “worth their  weight in silver,” costly infrastructure improvements  including supply and distribution roads, rail lines, and  lower than expected yields (West 1907, 14). A year after  the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the British  company sold their interests to a Mexican venture,  the Sociedad Aviadora de Minas de Real del Monte  y Pachuca (CRMyP’s precursor) and abandoned the  country (Randall 1985, 629).  Despite the British corporation’s withdrawal, H.E.  West in 1907, noted in The Mexican Mining Journal  that the British had introduced the region to “modern  times” (West 1907, 14). The British had, in fact, deeply  influenced local society and its culture: families like  the Rule, Straffon, and Ludlow, stayed and integrated  themselves into local politics, industry, and commerce;  British workers introduced Cornish pasties (meat pies),  known in Mexico as pastes, to local cuisine; soccer began  as a local pastime, but eventually became the national  sport; and Protestantism, the prevalent faith among the  Cornish, gained a toehold in a predominantly Roman  Catholic country. Much of Real’s urban physiognomy  changed because Cornish builders introduced doublepitched cottages roofed with red-painted corrugated  iron metal sheets (Figures 2 & 3). Today, because  of the architectural influence of Cornish vernacular  architecture, Real has been dubbed “little Cornwall”  (Cooper-Richet 2017). 2.4. Confluence of Local, Regional and Global Forces The Miner Hospital represents the culmination of  globalized sociopolitical and economic forces. After  Mexican independence was finally consolidated in  1821, unceasing political instability led to internal  insurrections, coups de etas, and frequent civil wars  that continuously undermined the nascent state. A  politically weak Mexico was constantly engaged in civil  conflict, and an easy target for foreign interventionism,  expansionism and coerced territorial secession. e.g.,  Texas Revolutionary War (1835-36) and the MexicanAmerican War (1846-48). Significantly, conflicts drained  the Mexican treasury, reduced natural resources, and  further frustrated Mexico’s political development. With  each devastating setback, the divide widened between  those seeking a modernized state and those seeking to  conserve the status quo.  In 1857, a liberal constitution was adopted that enabled  social reforms and overhauled the country’s legal  framework, which included ceding mining regulations  to states to provide the legal certainty needed to attract  foreign investment (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 26).  Then, in 1858 Benito Juárez, a liberal, was elected  president. He pledged to enact significant legislation  furthering political reforms codified by the Constitution  of 1857, which sparked yet another civil war, the 185861 Guerra de Reforma (Reform War). Exploiting Mexico’s  weakened state, France successfully invaded Mexico  in 1861 and imposed an Austro-Hungarian Habsburg,  Maximilian I, as its Second Emperor of Mexico (186467). Eventually, President Benito Juárez led a loyal liberal  army and expelled the Europeans. During the relatively  brief French occupation contemporary European  philosophies and technology deeply influenced leading  Mexican intellectual, military, political, and industrialist  Figure 2. “Little Portion” circa late nineteenth century,  Cornwall England, courtesy of Unique Homestays. 24 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org figures, which became convinced that only transforming  Mexico into a strong, sovereign, and modern nation,  could prevent future calamities.  2.5. Modernism and The Porfiriato It is perhaps a historical irony that Porfirio Diaz, a former  general who helped expel the French in 1867, turned  to Europe, especially France, to model his government’s  approach to Mexico’s modernization. While Modernism  includes a multitude of overlapping paradigms, Mexico’s  political, economic, and cultural development during  Diaz’s administration were primarily influenced by two  central ideas of European philosophical Modernism:  August Comte’s positivism and John Stuart Mill’s  utilitarian philosophy.  Comte’s positivism held at its central promise “the  formation of the new social system” (Comte 1998, 52).  Positivism’s promise, it seemed, was reciprocated by  market-driven innovation as entrepreneurs, scholars,  and government officials, began to benefit from  the Scientific Revolution’s ongoing contributions:  technological advances spurred on innovation across  industry, producing immense wealth among the  growing European bourgeoisie classes. Economically  liberalized states and their capitalist classes, enamored  with positivism and Mill’s utilitarianist free-market  approach, extracted wealth from labor and invested  heavily in technologically driven market advantages.  Eventually, after the initial industrialization boom, for  many European countries economic growth would not  be found in internal markets, but in financially favorable  globalized resource extraction and trade. Inspired by  Figure 3. Vista de Real del Monte, c. 1880 by Alfred Briquet, courtesty of Instituto Nacional de Antrpología e Historia (INAH). 25 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org France and its globalized influence, by the nineteenth  century’s last third Diaz’s government deployed  positivism and utilitarianism to administer the country  systematically.  By the early 1890s, a group of positivist scientists,  doctors, scholars, and bureaucrats, collectively known  as the “Cientίficos” (Scientists), formed the core of  Diaz’s politico-administrative State apparatus (María y  Campos 1991, 125). By 1900, the government adopted  the positivist motto “Order and Progress” (Comte  2020, 55). Diaz’s administration, initially 1877-80, and  continuously from 1884 to1911, utilized legal reforms  enabled by the 1857 Constitution that “crystallized the  laissez-faire trends begun by Benito Juárez” (Alvarez  1987, 29). During his administration the government encouraged foreign investment  as its principal development policy. In addition  to the problem of capital, Mexico also lacked  the technical knowledge to promote the  development and production of her economy.  Díaz, who favored the development of the nation  by the economically powerful, encouraged  foreign investment through legal statutes that  leaned heavily in favor of foreigners. (Alvarez  1987, 29) As a result, at first Diaz’s government successfully  stabilized the country politically while achieving  economic growth across all economic sectors—though  not among all socioeconomic groups. However, no  industry was more heavily favored than mining. Early  in 1884, Diaz successfully promoted new legislation  that brought much-needed legal and investment  certainty to the mining industry, generating a flood  of foreign investment into the sector (Kuntz Ficker  2010, 166). Soon, other industries were reformed  prompting additional foreign capital across all economic  sectors. Mexico’s growing industrialist and middle  class experienced impressive economic benefits. John  Coatsworth remarks that  Between 1877 and 1910 national income per  capita grew at an annual average rate of 2.3  percent, extremely rapid growth by world  standards, so fast indeed that per capita income  more than doubled in thirty-three years. (1978,  81) Steven Bunker further notes that Mexico’s emergent  middle and upper classes’ “participation in this market  exchange signified being part of Mexico’s modernization  efforts” (1997, 228). The Porfiriato, as the Diaz era is dubbed, forever changed  the country’s architectural, urban, sociopolitical, and  economic landscape (Herrera and Parra 2018, para. 37).  Burgeoning globalized demand for goods and services  prompted more foreign investment in Mexico, which  produced Modernist built environments, e.g., the  hospital, to systematically meet new market demands.  Economic success, however, came at a high social cost.  In Germany, for example, social problems generated by  industrialization and uneven wealth distribution were  severe enough that, at the insistence of Chancellor Otto  von Bismarck, it “became the first nation in the world to  adopt an old-age social insurance program in 1889” (SSA,  n.d.). More broadly, while Europe’s nineteenth century  industrial and scientific development lead to impressive  economic growth, it also generated socioeconomic  problems leading to social unrest, revolutions, and  continental war, e.g., 1848 and 1870-71.  Similarly, Mexico’s economic success belied significant  growing social and political problems as newly  produced wealth became concentrated among foreign  enterprises, national companies, relatively few families,  and investment syndicates; equally contradictory,  the modernization process produced mass rural  migration to cities, where the impoverished urban  population experienced deplorable living and working  conditions. Moreover, far from producing a long-term  stable and politically democratic state, the Porfiriato  often undergirded its interests by frequently using  violent force to support foreign investors, national  political bosses, and business cronies—all ostensibly  justified by advances in telecommunications, rail, port  infrastructure, manufacturing, and a globally integrated  banking system. Like Europe, Mexico’s successful  industrialization and global market integration,  generated latent aporias which became evident with  the Miner Hospital. Growing sociopolitical and economic discontent,  already evident in the early 1890s, came to a head in  the Mexican Revolution (c.1910-20) when peasants,  farmers, and the working classes grew despondent  as living conditions deteriorated (Tutino 2018, 174).  Despite brutally suppressed labor strikes, especially  in mining, the Revolution, political instability, and  industrialized profits made Mexico an attractive mining  region throughout the first half of the twentieth century.  3. CONFLUENCE OF MODERNISM’S FORCES 3.1. Conception With Mexico fully vested in attracting foreign  investment, the United States Smelting Refining and  Mining Company (USSRMC) incorporated in January  1906 “to acquire other mining interests in Mexico and  Nevada” (Strack, n.d., under “Overview”) Five days  after the acquisition, the Mexican Herald (published  in English) reported on February 17 that “[USSRMC]  26 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org intend putting into the company several million dollars  into opening the mines, building mills, and in new  equipment” (Mexican Herald 1906a, 7). Shortly after  the purchase, the USSRMC executed its ambitious  business plan. Confidently applying innovative electric  technology, throughout 1906, the company rapidly  replaced outdated British mining machines to ramp up  yields at Real’s mines.  In April, USSRMC purchased 4000 hp from the Canadianowned Mexican Light and Power Company (Mexican  Herald 1906d, 1) and proceeded to build over 8000  km of infrastructure tunnels to bring electricity to Real,  and the entire region, to provide enough power for the  mining equipment (Mota 2018). Through the end of  1909, the company had installed nine electric winches,  ranging between 110 and 250 hp, and compressors in  each of its Real mines (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez  Badillo 2005, 10). The combination of electric machinery  and the newly perfected silver cyanidation process in  1907, resulted in tremendous success: while in 1906  USSRMC achieved just over 3.5 million dollars in net  earnings, by 1910 it reported 3.74 million dollars in net  earnings; its 7 percent preferred stock and 4 percent  common stock yields easily surpassing expectations  (Stevens 1911, 1737-38).  Despite The Mexican Mining Journal’s assurance that  “the successful operation of this big company on  modern lines will prove undoubtedly of such benefit to  the camp that those who have criticized will shortly be  praising [emphasis added]” (Historic and Famous 1907,  17): similar to the Porfiriato’s internalized sociopolitical  contradictions, USSRMC’s mining success would reduce  employment opportunities, and ultimately lead to a  deadly toll on miners. The initial suspension of most  mining activity, combined with workers replaced by “the  latest and best machinery available” (Mexican Herald  1906c, 11), led the USSRMC to lay off hundreds of  miners; over 400 left the region to find work elsewhere  causing generalized “misery” (El Pais 1906, 3; Mexican  Herald 1906b, 11). As Alan Derickson observes More than any other factor, the hazards  of the job drove hardrock miners to create  and maintain health and welfare programs.  Accidents crippled and killed countless workers.  Debilitating industrial diseases took a heavy  toll. Industrialization exacerbated old risks and  generated new ones. In particular, silicosis  became rampant in the wake of the technological  revolution of the late nineteenth century. (1988,  30) To be sure, new technology reduced certain mining  risks but generated others, often with more severe  adverse outcomes. For example, “[t]he introduction of  electric locomotives […] meant that workers traded the  risk of being kicked by mules for the increased risk of  being squashed against mine walls by large engines”  (Derickson 1988, 32). Then, a significant mining event over 2,000 km away  shook the North American mining industry. On June 1,  1906, Mexican workers at the Cananea copper mine  in Sonora, Mexico, went on strike demanding the  Mexico-based US-owned Cananea Consolidated Copper  Company end deteriorating labor conditions that had  significantly increased casualties and establish wage  parity. The company’s owner, William Cornell Greene,  and Mexican government officials were unmoved by  the miners’ demands. Mexican federal and local police,  soldiers, company staff, and Arizona Rangers crossed  the international border with the permission of Sonora’s  Governor Rafael Izábal, and proceeded to brutally  suppress the strike, injuring hundreds, and killing thirty  miners (Cárdenas García 1998, 144). Though the strike  ended four days later, the strike’s aftereffects, factored  into the 1907 U.S. financial crisis and fueled grievances  that culminated in the Mexican Revolution. Other  mining operations, like USSRMC at Real, took notice of  the catastrophic results. Aware of increasing numbers and severity of mining  injuries, USSRMC elected a different path: rather than  risk a generalized, highly disruptive labor strike and  violence that could endanger future production, the  company negotiated with mining leaders. In September  1906, USSRMC’s upper management, namely its  Mexican operations manager Morril Spaulding and chief  medical officer A.J. Hoskins, met with Real’s Mayor,  Agustίn Straffon, and mining leaders to propose the  construction of a new hospital. The hospital was to be  a cutting-edge medical facility, with medical staff, from  doctors to nurses, focused on the miners’ specific needs.  There were precedents for a company-operated mining  hospital. In the United States, the Miner’s Hospital in  Hazleton, Pennsylvania, opened in 1889; and the Ereğli  Company hospital at Zonguldak in the Ottoman Empire  opened in May 1897 (Quataert 2006, 192). In Mexico,  however, this would be the first hospital of its kind.  Arguably, building and operating a mining hospital was  a win-win scenario for the company: on the one hand,  by providing miners and their families with healthcare,  they could demonstrate genuine concern for worker  welfare; on the other hand, building the hospital would  not only quell any discontent regarding a lack of medical  attention but also facilitate faster recovery of a labor  force that represented a vital company investment in  training and experience. At the meeting, the parties  agreed to jointly develop the hospital immediately  so miners would receive the best care possible for  mining-related injuries and, when possible, facilitate  27 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org and supervise rehabilitation programs for the injured  (AHCRdMyP, n.d., 1).  To finance the hospital’s construction, equipment,  and operation, the agreement called for the miners to  contribute, and the company to match, a one-time fee  of five Mexican cents and an ongoing fee of between  2 percent and 4 percent of miners’ wages during  construction (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez Badillo  2005, 12). Hospital construction began in late 1906  on a 3,926 m2 parcel that was eventually ceded in  September of 1908 by the workers in exchange for the  company’s continued maintenance of facilities and staff  salaries (Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.). Belem Oviedo, head  of the museum’s supervisory and administrative trust,  notes that when the hospital was finished, it was “one  of the most beautiful, modern, and functional hospital  buildings of its era” (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez  Badillo 2005, 12). Once in operation, the hospital was  initially staffed by Hoskins, two assistant physicians (one  Dr. Nájera, a Mexican national), a Matron (chief nurse),  five assistant nurses, and a pharmacist. The first Matron,  Nelly Zurhaar, arrived in 1907 from the Netherlands and  would head the staff until her death in 1959.  4. DESIGN STRATEGIES OF HOSPITAL MINERO 4.1. Architectural Zeitgeist Little is known about the hospital’s designers, as the  construction drawings were prepared by USSRMC  engineers and signed by an “E. Islas.”2  However, it is  possible to gain some insight into the region’s design  zeitgeist from contemporary newspapers. A German  engineer, Ernesto Fuchs, who had emigrated to  Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 1870s, had designed and  was supervising to great acclaim the construction of the  Bank of Hidalgo in Pachuca, the state’s capital (Figure 4).  While the bank’s façade was an eclectic mix of European  Neoclassical motifs and styles, Fuchs channeled the  era’s emphasis on modernity, stating that the building  “is entirely of steel and stone construction” and the  “interior finishing of the building is in accordance  with the most modern ideas [emphasis added]”  (Hemerobiblioteca, n.d.). 4.2. The Hospital The hospital embodied multiple ideas associated with  nineteenth century Modernism; its existence evidenced  Mexico’s globally driven industrialization and was  conceived as part of an overall strategy to increase  labor productivity. Positivism and utilitarianism had  prompted typological evolution in response to empirical  observations, a parti that prioritized functional  processes over all other considerations, integration of  the latest technology, and the use of globally fashionable  or recently adopted pragmatic aesthetic vocabularies,  e.g., red corrugated iron roofs, interpreted with local  materials, to express a modern identity.  Though there is evidence that hospitals have existed  as a spatial typology since Mesopotamia or Dynastic  Egypt, it would be in the nineteenth century that  significant innovations transformed hospitals “from  traditional charitable institutions […] to modern  medical institutions” (Kisacky 2019, 288). Many of these  innovations were proposed by an English nurse, Florence  Nightingale, “the Angel of the Crimea.” After heavy  losses by the British during the Crimean War (1856-58),  Nightingale was dispatched to the Bosporus (Turkey) to  improve conditions for wounded soldiers. Despite initial  opposition from British doctors, Nightingale successfully  reorganized the medical facilities and vastly reduced the  mortality rate among the wounded.3  She, and her team  of nurses, were able to do so by introducing several key  modifications to traditional hospital design and patient  care that would later be evident in the design of Real’s  mining hospital. In the spirit of positivism, Nightingale  2 Courtesy of the AHMMAC Archive, Pachuca Hidalgo. 3 At the time, reduction in the rate of mortality was  consciously misreported by British authorities to increase moral  among troops, however, actual mortality rate decreases were still an  extraordinary achievement.  Figure 4. Banco de Hidalgo, c. 1910, by Ernesto Fuchs. Author  unknown, courtesy of the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American  Collection, University of Texas, Austin. 28 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org codified her design ideas in “Notes on Hospitals”, which  became the international bible of late nineteenthcentury hospital design, correlated hospital mortality  rates to hospital layouts as a means of assessing the  healthiness of hospital building design” (Kisacky 2017,  23).  Real’s mining hospital displayed various avantgarde design strategies associated with Modernist  architecture. The first of these characteristics was its  siting: not only was the hospital conveniently located  atop one the highest of Real’s urbanized hills and roughly  equidistant to three major mine heads, but following  Florence Nightingale’s guidelines, it was located outside  of the town’s denser urban fabric, where patients could  enjoy a quiet environment along with a continuous  supply of fresh air to prevent airborne contagion  (Kisacky 2017, 25). Moreover, its location followed  the pattern where “smaller rural hospitals served a  specific community in facilities that typically included  only necessary medical spaces and technologies but  provided more personalized care” (Kisacky 2019, 290).  The hospital’s master plan (Figure 5), unchanged to  this day, is composed of a courtyard surrounded by  three individualized single-storied masses running  east to west. In keeping with “the hospital designs of  late eighteenth-century Europe,” the campus’ plan  “maximized air flow and quality by structuring the  hospital as a collection of small buildings, each filled  with a narrow, linear room, disconnected from other  spaces and surrounded by open air” (Kisacky 2017, 15) The longest volume, nearly 60 m long, runs parallel to  the aptly named Hospital Street on the campus’ ¬south  side and is the hospital’s main public façade. Unlike the  Bank, the use of Cantera (ash stone) was limited to an  approximately 1.5 m tall base course (Figure 6).  Above that, its upper molding band persists throughout  the courtyard elevations but not the Cantera plaques.  Above this base is a series of alternating orange brick  and locally collected cobblestone bands, ending with  concrete quoins that mark folding planes. These  Romanesque-like striations, however, do not repeat  in other façades. Instead, all other exterior facades  are composed of vast cobblestone planes, interrupted  by windows framed by dematerializing orange brick  surrounds. The use of stone in this fashion was  consistent with traditions brought by the Cornish. As  Gerda Peterich notes, this type of cobblestone masonry  originates  in traditions of rubble wall techniques imported  from Europe, particularly from England, where  it served the demands of the pioneer farmers  especially well, as the gathering of stones cleared  Figure 5. Hospital Master Plan, Courtesy of the Museo de Medicina Laboral. 29 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org their fields, and the building material could be  accumulated at convenient times […] (1956, 12) The willful adoption of the foreign Byzantine-like façade  striation, executed with local materials, suggests a  global architectural outlook: the use of readily available  cobblestone to build English-type walls, combined with  the Cornish-type red corrugated iron roofs, points to a  local re-interpretation of imported building traditions. The street-facing massing has two entrances: the  easternmost, a porte-cochere gate, is bounded to  the north by a colonnade separating a roofed but  horizontally open area from the courtyard beyond; to  the west is the main or civic entrance, recognizable  from the street by its large, horizontally protruding  volume. From this civic entrance starts the campus’  main north-south organizational axis. Once past the  main entrance doors, you arrive at an entrance hall. To  the left of this hall were the kitchen, staff dining hall,  pantry, storeroom, service quarters, and a pharmacy. To  the right were consultation offices, a second pharmacy,  three bedrooms with bathrooms, laundry facilities, and  a boiler room. Past the entry hall, visitors are confronted  with a proto-modernist spatial expression: exiting  northward, visitors step down onto a ceramic-paved  path bounded by rainwater runners that asymmetrically  bifurcate a garden courtyard (Figure 7).  The courtyard seems to deploy incipient Modernist  ideas on healing spaces proposed by the late eighteenthcentury German landscape scholar Christian Cay Lorenz:  The garden should be directly connected to  the hospital [… ]A view from the window into  blooming and happy scenes will invigorate the  patient […] [and] encourages patients to take  a walk […] The plantings should wind along  dry paths, which offer benches […]The spaces  between could have beautiful lawns and colorful  flower beds […] A hospital garden should have  everything to enjoy nature and to promote a  healthy life. (quoted in Marcus and Sachs 2014,  7) Lorenz’s texts, widely translated across Europe by  the end of the eighteenth century, were especially  influential in England and France (Parshall 1993, 125).  Following Nightingale’s suggestion, the hospital’s  internal courtyard was relatively open to the east, bound  only by a low-height property wall that ensured fresh air  first circulated through the campus’ courtyard and then  through the buildings’ windows and into the wards.  The low wall height enabled morning sunshine to bathe  the south-facing windows of the main patient wards.  To the courtyard’s west, possibly placed to block the  setting sun, was the Matron’s residence. Its bedroom,  living room, kitchen, and dining room arranged in a  Figure 6. The Main Facade, facing south along Hospital Street, photograph by Author. 30 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org “shotgun” architectural typology. Here, visitors glimpse  a more modern aesthetic: Originally, the residence’s  east façade was an evenly plastered wall, interrupted by  two darkly framed windows and framed by two white  pilasters with simplified bases and Doric-like capitals  painted to contrast starkly (Figure 8). Now operating as  a museum, the Matron’s residence’s east windows have  been protected from the sun with an awning, while the  façade exhibits cobblestones. Directly to the east, an  octagonal fountain aligns axially with the residence’s  east windows. At the eastern end of the courtyard was  an area reserved for keeping live animals used to feed  patients, the cook’s apartment, and storage facilities. Finally, the hospital’s main wing, located at the north  end of the north-south axis, housed the operative  medical facilities and the patient wards. The hospital  wards exemplified a standardized design popularized worldwide by  Florence Nightingale—which promised to make  hospital buildings into places of cure rather than  incubators of disease. Pavilion-ward hospital  buildings included hygienic materials and details,  large open wards, support spaces, and little else.  (Kisacky 2019, 289) Figure 7.

Though today the  façade is dominated by cobblestone, as Figure 9 shows,  this façade initially matched the Matron’s residence  vocabulary: its evenly plastered walls, darkly painted  window frames, bright white pilasters, punctuated by  darkly painted capitals and bases that sit on the base  trim, produced a striking contrast with the administrative  wing’s cobblestone and brick façade. Entry to the  principal branch is vertically highlighted by a protruding  double-story volume with a two-pitched roof.  The entry, formed by an archway surrounding a recessed  neo-classical frieze and columns, houses a vestibule that  doubled as a chapel (see Figure 7). Behind the chapel  was the on-duty nurses’ station, another of Nightingale’s  contributions to hospital design. As part of the lessons  learned in the Crimean War, she had outlined the need  for a centralized nursing station, from where nurses  could supervise the wards and rush to assist a patient  when necessary. Behind the entry vestibule and at  the center of the main wing were bathing facilities,  the assistant nurses’ bedrooms, laundry, and pressing  facilities. Real’s hospital layout was more the result  of empirical observation and the consideration of  processes than strict precedent. As Annmarie Adams  observes, architects after 1900 bolstered their architectural authority not  through their experience building related  institutions, but rather through their direct  observation of medical practice. […] It was their  special knowledge of the routines, needs, and  procedures of specific departments that enabled  them to master the complex programmatic  requirements of the modern hospital. (2008,  108) According to Dr. Hoskins, two large wards, one to each  side of the entry vestibule, housed twelve beds each  (six to a long side) but could, if needed, be fitted with  double that amount for a total of forty-eight beds  (Figure 10) (Hoskins 1909, 38-42). It is possible that  the two wards were spread out symmetrically from  the vestibule and nurses’ area to avoid “the corridor  system, with double wards on each side, and so no cross  ventilation,” a spatial practice bemoaned by Nightingale  (McDonald 2020, 31). Then, following the latest design  thinking, users walked through the wards through a  central corridor informally bounded by the patients’  beds. Kisacky suggests this was because later hospital  designs considered “the theory of transmission by direct  contact could have provided the basis for an alternate  architectural model of hospital design, one that focused  on controlling the movement and condition of persons  and objects” (2017, 107). The inward direction beds  faced was an expression of maximized administrative  control and maintenance: The narrow width and long walls full of windows  maximized natural architectural ventilation and  left no dark corners where patients could hide  illicit behaviors. Having the patients face into the  ward put the patient’s head adjacent to the supply  of fresh air but also facilitated nurse supervision,  allowed direct physical access to the patient  on both sides for examination or treatment,  and prevented the patient’s exhalations and  excretions from coating the adjacent walls.  (Kisacky 2017, 65) The floors were made of light-colored cedar or maple  wood, which would permit the detection of filth  and reflect light from the windows and when in use,  electrical light fixtures. Past the east patient ward  was an x-ray room equipped with state-of-the-art  Figure 9. The Main Wing of the Hospital, c. 1909.

Photograph by  author. 32 ENQUIRY: The ARCC Journal | VOLUME 20 ISSUE 1 | 2023 http://www. arcc-journal.org instruments (Figure 11) and the pharmacists’ lab (Figure  12). The available x-ray equipment when the hospital  opened in 1907 presents one of the clearest examples of  Modernism’s contradictions (Gómez and Rodríguez-Paz  2018). Throughout late nineteenth century Modernism,  social reformers pushed for social engineering to prevent  crime associated with impoverished workers had  prioritized medical innovation: science and technology  had made x-rays a valuable tool in healthcare. Yet, Real’s  x-ray equipment was one of only a handful of machines  found in all of Mexico at that time. In an era where so  many governments boasted about social reform, the  equipment had been purchased by the private mining  company, for a specialized industry hospital, on the  outskirts of a town with 12,251 total inhabitants in 1900  (Secretaría 1902, table I). What mattered then was the  capacity to continue to mine and produce ore; in that  context, an x-ray machine was a wise investment. To the west of the entrance vestibule, users entered  a ward commonly used for rehabilitation. Past this  ward, at the end of the wing, was the surgery suite and  sterilization room equipped with the latest medical  technology and tools. Finally, the hospital’s interiors  were also the epitome of modern: ‘all the buildings are  heated and lighted by electricity and provided with all  modern improvements’ (Gonzalez, Grothe, and Salazar  1911, 42), while the non-residential interior room  walls, floors, and other surfaces were plastered and Figure 11.

All these hospital  features were, as foreseen by the USSMRC, needed as  mining-related casualties, including deaths, increased  dramatically: in July of 1912 alone, staff at the hospital  tended to “764 sick, 112 injured, 1089 medical consults  and 142 home visits” (Oviedo Gámez and Hernandez  Badillo 2005, 13). For those fortunate to survive but  unable to return to work, the USSRMC provided limitedtime financial aid to the     Critical access hospitals (CAH) aim to improve healthcare access for a rural population with healthcare access inequities. Living in rural areas of the United States associates with inferior health outcomes, with a 40% higher preventable hospitalization rate and a 23% higher mortality rate than urban residents (Johnston et al., 2019). Established disparities, such as longer driving dis\u0002tance to a hospital (Billi et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2019) or lack of access to healthcare specialists, have resulted in different health outcomes between rural and urban areas (Brundisini et al., 2013; Johnston et al., 2019). To bridge this gap, CAH intend to improve access to healthcare, coordinate with experts and providers, and serve as the hubs of healthcare for the rural population (The Rural Health Information Hub, 2022). It is essential to improve the understanding of environmental qualities that impact the quality of care for developing effective policies and design guidelines for rural healthcare. Current evidence suggests physical environment is one of the fac\u0002tors affecting rural healthcare patient experience, staff recruitment, patient participation, patient satisfaction, processes, and staff satisfaction (Cai et al., 2017, 2019; Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, & Valipoor, 2016). Nevertheless, a limited number of studies have focused on user or organizational outcomes related to the physical environment of rural healthcare settings (Cai et al., 2017, 2019; Haddox, 2018; Pati, Gaines, & Valipoor, 2016). These studies recommend investigating rural care teams’ perceptions of the potential relationships between environmental variables. Cai et al. (2017) study showed that existing facilities need to be improved in providing high-quality patient care satisfaction and staff work experience. In another study, Cai et al. (2019) survey of rural residents suggested the topmost important environmental quality as pri\u0002vacy, adequate chairs in exam rooms for families, and practical tools for information sharing and communication between patients, families, and clinicians. The research also found a correlation between design features for an open counter to communicate with the receptionists and simulta\u0002neously supporting patient privacy. The authors also emphasize the need for patient privacy support in exam rooms to discuss insurance infor\u0002mation and financial implications, as such topics are a paramount concern for rural residents. Haddox et al. (2018) performed a pilot qualita\u0002tive study on the elderly population of a rural out\u0002patient clinic. The study found that lack of privacy or confidentiality at check-in, clutter, seating prox\u0002imity to contagious patients in waiting rooms, and inadequate natural lighting in the reception and exam rooms were some of the perceived barriers to patient participation that may cause missing appointments. Pati et al. (2016a) conducted an explorative qualitative study of administrators of four rural hospitals. The findings indicated that older facilities were inadequate or unattractive workspaces, negatively affecting efficiency, safety, clinician specialist recruitment, staff mor\u0002ale, and patient perception of their local hospital patient experience. Small operating rooms (OR) needed more flexible teamwork space and imposed equipment installation issues that impacted surgeon recruitment. Laboratory, phar\u0002macy, imaging, or radiology departments also reported challenges such as the inadequate size of space, configurations with improper adjacen\u0002cies, or in demand for additional storage size. These conditions negatively impacted operational efficiency and safe delivery of care. The focus of this exploratory study was to address the following research questions: What is the staff’s perception of the current obstacles and needs relevant to the CAH’s infrastructure, physical environment attributes, or ambient conditions? Furthermore, why is improving and overcoming these obstacles and needs essential? The underlying frameworkinthis studyisthatthe facility design and qualities of CAHs impact participant or organiza\u0002tional outcomes. Additionally, the study adds to the limited body of knowledge on the impact of a pan\u0002demic on rural healthcare facility design. Finally, this study aims to contribute to the evidence-based design literature and inform decision makers of future CAH design policy, practice, and research. Method This cross-sectional exploratory qualitative case study was conducted as part of the facility Zamani et al. 307 planning process for a CAH in rural North Car\u0002olina. The hospital was open to the rural county in 1930 and included specialties such as cardiology, family practice, urgent care, wound care, ortho\u0002pedic surgery, women’s health, and emergency department (ED). Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 explain critical department: Departmental Gross Square Foot (DGSF) and room Square Footages (SFs). The main hospital had two levels for a total of 85,000 SF. Outpatient clinic buildings com\u0002prise seven detached buildings scaled between 1754 and 4201 (SF). An additional nursing center department, with approximately 22788 (SF), was currently vacant and used for storage. Procedures The planning, architecture, and operational assessment team combined semi-structured inter\u0002views, surveys, and observation assessment methods to understand needs, goals, and environ\u0002mental challenges across diverse departments. The CAH’s Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the study protocol. For this article, we will primarily focus on the survey responses. We collected data during November and October 2021 over 4 weeks. Initially, the survey was printed in paper format and distributed by the CAH coordinator. Later, the CAH used depart\u0002mental email distribution lists to distribute the online survey link created in Google Forms. It was noted in the email and surveyed introductory paragraph that participation is voluntary. The study avoided coercion to participate by not offer\u0002ing payment incentives and no threat of harm if they declined participation. We collected no iden\u0002tifying information from participants. Instrument An expert panel of planners, architects, and researchers collaborated to create a short survey to understand staff’s satisfaction with 13 items, including overall physical environment, space allocation, team communication, patient flow, medication flow, privacy, provider flow, fam\u0002ily–visitor flow, or departmental adjacency. We could not perform a reliability test due to limited access to participants. Respondents were asked to rate the various items based on their perceived Table 1. Primary Departments and Key Room Counts and Sizes in the Main Critical Access Hospital Building.

Demographic questions included department type and role. The open\u0002ended question asked to the participants is: “What is working well in your current depart\u0002ment? What would you change to make your department work better?” In addition to the surveys, 21 staff partici\u0002pated in 10 focus group sessions. The hospital coordinator recruited staff through emails, encompassing nurses, physicians, administra\u0002tive, and leadership roles. The team explored clinical and administrative staff experiences regarding physical environment needs impact\u0002ing processes and performances. Questions focused on department goals, challenges, and success factors. Similar to the open-ended ques\u0002tions in the survey, we also asked the staff about the physical environment changes needed to improve their care delivery. Handwritten notes were taken during the focus group interviews, capturing essential insights. This article focuses primarily on reporting the responses relevant to the physical environment concerns. Participants The CAH site was undergoing a 3-year master facility planning; thus, the study was based on a convenience sample. The entire CAH staff was the population of interest, including managers, clinicians, and nonclinicians (n ¼ 207). There were no exclusion or inclusion criteria. Seventy-four individuals completed the online or paper survey with an overall 36% response rate. Tables 2 and 3 display participants’ depart\u0002ments and roles. Due to limited direct access to participants, we conducted no further analysis to determine the characteristics of staff who did not respond. Data Preparation and Analysis Qualitative data preparation and analysis of open-ended responses were performed in MS Excel. The Google Form and paper-based responses were organized and merged into an MS Excel document. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using the JASP Version 0.16.4.0 soft\u0002ware for the Likert-type scale-based questions. The internal expertise team reviewed all codes Figure 1. The main hospital site plan comprises various buildings, including the emergency department, surgical department, medical office buildings, and a vacant nursing center.

The goal was to understand the staff’s level of satis\u0002faction with the overall physical environment, space allocation, department adjacency, and pri\u0002vacy. The second phase included looking at departments with lower satisfaction ratings for these physical environment ratings. Initially, all transcripts were coded based on their contents with particular attention to subthemes suggested by Pati et al. (2016a): (a) any direct reference to the facility needs or physical environment qua\u0002lities of the CAH, including the buildings, departments, and workspaces, and (b) any out\u0002comes associated with the physical design such as staff or patient experiences, care quality, operations, or safety. Next, we clustered the subthemes into key themes aligning with the content analysis performed by Cai et al. (2019) and Pati et al. (2016a). Results Satisfaction Ratings Table 3 displays the descriptive statistics for the overall CAH and staff’s average satisfaction per department (Table 4). The findings suggest low satisfaction levels for ED, lab, surgery, and wound-care space allocations. Wound-care staff was also comparatively dissatisfied with depart\u0002ment adjacency and the overall environment compared to other departments. The surgical staff was the least satisfied with the privacy attributes of their department. Due to low participation Figure 2.

Zamani et al. 311 from some departments, the survey results are qualitative and not generalizable. Open-Ended Findings Two clusters emerged from the content analysis, representing facility needs (rightly sized spaces, functional needs, COVID-19 needs, and improved access) and physical environment con\u0002ditions (clutter, visibility, flooring quality, noise, privacy, cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and tem\u0002perature; Table 5 and 6). Safety and quality were the two emerging outcomes of the physical envir\u0002onment’s shortcomings: safety concerns to infec\u0002tion control compliance and patient, equipment, and staff safety; quality pertained to patient flow, staff flow, staff performance, patient–visitor Table 5.

Facility needs. Facility needs were the most men\u0002tioned themes in the open-ended responses. Emerging subthemes included the need for ade\u0002quately sized spaces, functional needs, COVID\u000219 needs, and access improvements that will be reviewed in the subsequent paragraphs. Rightly sized spaces. The first subtheme focuses on the inadequate space sizes in outdated build\u0002ings. These included desiring larger departments, workstations, exam rooms, bathrooms, offices, meeting spaces, waiting rooms, equipment rooms, break rooms, or training rooms. Adminis\u0002trative staff reflected the need for larger meeting spaces for staff, office spaces, and rounding rooms. Lab department staff requested more extensive patient waiting, storage, drawing area, testing space, equipment room, or intravenous (IV) rooms to improve patient experience and flow. The ED staff mentioned needing larger patient rooms to accommodate computers, equip\u0002ment rooms, storage space, and adequately sized nurse stations to improve patient flow. Universal and flexible rooms that were identical to monitor\u0002ing capabilities were desired. The surgical team perceived the space needed to be more responsive to departmental growth. They emphasized the need for larger storage spaces, nurse stations, ORs, patient bays, and central sterile spaces cor\u0002responding to the patient volume. The insufficient equipment storage space affected equipment safety outcomes, as one of the staff explained: Table 7. Example of Quotes Relevant to Safety and Quality Outcomes.

Some of our equipment is stored in the old nursing center, and if it is needed during surgery, we have to wait for someone to get the equipment and wait for them to return. This is costing time and money due to no storage (Surgery) Zamani et al. 313 We are outgrowing our space in the OR. We need more room to store our equipment. The facility invests in state-of-the-art equipment, and there is nowhere to put it and care for it. It gets moved around and bumped. The small patient bays affected staff perfor\u0002mance, visitor experience, and communication outcomes. One staff member commented on how the small bays affect their operations: “Our bays are tiny. It makes it difficult to accommodate visitors, perform nerve blocks, or attend to a patient if there is an additional provider in the bay.” Staff emphasized the need for a more exten\u0002sive Sterile Processing Department (SPD) to accommodate more washers, storage, and desk space to support the number of sterilized trays and OR procedures. The inadequate space resulted in stacking trays on each other, which resulted in the risk of case delays, contamination, and subsequent patient infection. Further, the poorly stacked trays created safety concerns for staff as they needed to bed down to pick heavy trays from shelves (Figure 3). Functional needs. Functional needs were cap\u0002tured by mentioning additional spaces or revised adjacencies varying by the department. Administrative staff reflected the need for more meeting or conference spaces, additional classrooms, workspace, or rounding rooms with integrated technology for virtual meetings. Another administrative staff mentioned the need for private office rooms to “be more cohesive to accomplish more work.” The clinical staff communicated the concern about the lack of storage in the ED, resulting in cluttered hallways and a “jammed” nurse station that imposed a safety hazard. ED staff requested additional bathrooms, equipment rooms, safe rooms, and exterior decontamination storage. One of the ED staff elaborated on the possible reuse of the nursing home currently used as stor\u0002age for the ED spatial needs (Figure 4). One of the staff elaborated: [the closed nursing home facility] area would give the Emergency Room (ER) the Space it needs, stor\u0002age, extra bathrooms, and privacy adjacent to our helicopter flight area. Saving the patient at least 10 minutes of critical time. The clinical staff communicated the concern about the lack of storage in the ED, resulting in cluttered hallways and a “jammed” nurse station that imposed a safety hazard. Staff from the imaging department thought the adjacency to ED was optimal. They reflected the need for an additional shower and changing rooms for the entire facility. Laboratory staff reflected the need for staff break rooms and lock\u0002ers, American Disability Act (ADA)–compliant toilets, and storage. One staff noted that depart\u0002mental adjacencies were substantial for efficient flow, cost, and patient satisfaction: “We need more space. And not chopped-up space; you must walk across the hall to use additional space. We need space that is all together.” “We need more space. And not chopped\u0002up space; you must walk across the hall to use additional space. We need space that is all together.”. The pharmacy department requested addi\u0002tional patient toilet rooms and a satellite phar\u0002macy. Outpatient clinic staff thought the separate clinic buildings with three to four exams per building were not optimal, as one described: Table 8.

The Sterile Processing Department was considered small to accommodate the surgical department patient volume. Source: Image Copyright: Author. Zamani et al. 315 requirements. With this inefficient adjacency, there was a need for reserved parking and a risk of patient falls. This situation also impacted patient safety and satisfaction outcomes as patients needed to gown and drive to the chamber. Surgical staff explained the need for additional equipment storage, workspaces, bathrooms, and walled patient bays. An inadequate number of post anesthesia care unit (PACU) bays resulted in an urge to discharge patients to maintain flow from the OR to patient bays, which affected the patient experience of feeling “rushed to be dis\u0002charged.” Staff perceived the need for bays with doors to protect patient privacy and satisfy stor\u0002age needs in bays. Surgical staff described that inappropriately located equipment storage affects efficiency and cost outcomes.

Smaller departments, such as lab, cardiac rehab, or ED, were more concerned about spatial limitations that restricted the COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. The ED registration staff complained about the waiting area congestion and its impact on visibility and safety during the pandemic. The staff noted that moving sick patients to another section with removable dividable walls during the pandemic was safer. However, these walls impeded visibi\u0002lity for the ER registration staff. Therefore, the ED registration staff recommended including glass walls to support visibility and patient separation (Figure 5). With the ease of pandemic limitations, the CAH removed the walls with only one glass wall remaining, resulting in the current open waiting room that decreased the perception of safety for staff. The pandemic highlighted the need for revisit\u0002ing the ambulance entrance to the ED as it pre\u0002sented spatial challenges to accommodate officials for mass casualty and contaminated patient incidents. Further, staff elaborated on the need for climate-controlled storage for deconta\u0002mination equipment adjacent to the ED. Decon\u0002tamination equipment stored in a distant location from the ED entrance and exterior space could have been more efficient spatial adjacency. Most outpatient clinic patients had complex chronic conditions; some traveled up to 20 miles to access primary care services. Clinicians recom\u0002mended expanding telehealth services for well\u0002ness visits due to Medicare reimbursement. The current use of telehealth for provider visits was 10%. In the current state, preregistration occurs through text messages, patients wait in the car and Figure 5.

The old infrastructure and inadequate spaces resulted in many noncompli\u0002ant ADA toilet rooms. To improve patient access, staff recommend extending the operat\u0002ing hours for some departments, including phys\u0002ical therapy. Staff also mentioned necessary exterior upgrades to improve patient accessibil\u0002ity, especially for older patients: “For patients with walkers, walking across sand or accessibil\u0002ity with a ramp is difficult; we need to improve the patient experience.” Smaller scale clinics were a positive attribute for patient experience outcomes as they reduced walking distances for older patients. Adjacency and access to or within departments were also crucial for staff. For example, lab staff explained the need for a more cohesive department to reduce walking distances and improve staff per\u0002formance. Adding automatic doors for ED was also a recommendation to improve visitor access and staff efficiency to eliminate the need for staff to open doors. Physical environment attributes and ambient condition. Staff elaborated on improving physical environment attributes and ambient conditions by reducing clutter, improving visibility, flooring material quality, cleanliness, aesthetic condition, temperature comfort, and privacy attributes dis\u0002cussed in the upcoming paragraphs. Reduce clutter. Restricted space in specific departments such as ED or surgery resulted in a need for more storage spaces for equipment, carts, or beds cluttered ambiance (Figure 6). Staff believed that reducing the clutter improves efficiency, safety, and costs. Staff commented on the need for additional equipment storage to improve flow and reduce hallway clutter for operational efficiency outcomes. One of the ED nurses described how the nursing station gets cluttered with personnel and carts. This condition reduced the clinician’s satisfaction, as one described: “We feel like we are sardines in our nurse’s station.” State-of-the-art equip\u0002ment stored in the hallways surgical depart\u0002ment was bumped and moved around, which harmed equipment quality. The surgical ser\u0002vices staff emphasized the importance of reducing OR clutter to improve operations and movements. Visibility. Visibility was an important attribute, especially for the ED department. Staff noted that the nurse station size and form affected visibility toward psychiatric patients. The registration staff noted that the wide registration area with inade\u0002quate security staff in the evenings is a security concern. The lab department staff considered the open workstation design a positive attribute, improving visibility and communication among staff and managers. Flooring quality. The bedded care staff noted the need to replace the corridor carpet in a few years, when obsolete, with a hard surface—lux\u0002ury vinyl tile to improve infection control out\u0002comes (Figure 7). Staff recommended flooring quality improvements that included removing stains and cracks, improving exterior flooring quality, and installing waterproof material without gaps. Such improvements needed the dismissal of short-term costs to satisfy infection control guide\u0002lines and patient safety. Improve cleanliness, aesthetic conditions, and temperature. The hospital needed updating, cleaning, and modernization to improve staff recruitment, visitor perception, safety, and con\u0002formance to the current healthcare architectural style. Staff found that departments were “antiquated” and reflected the need to remodel and replace dark floorings and walls (Figure 8). For example, a staff described: “the hospital should not look old. We need to improve the flooring and waiting rooms and facelift things. Landscaping needs attention: the parking lot needs to be kept up, and visual needs to improve.” 318 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 17(1) Figure 7.

Zamani et al. 319 The hospital’s physical environment attributes and ambient conditions influenced staff recruit\u0002ment and retention. One of the outpatient clinic staff mentioned: For recruitment, the Hospital should not look old, including flooring, waiting rooms, face-lift things. Landscaping needs attention, the parking lot needs to be kept up, and visual needs to improve. Figure 8. Staff recommended replacing and enhancing the ambient condition of the emergency department by replacing the dark floors and colors.

Reduce noise and improve privacy. Smaller departments and insufficient workspaces resulted in a perception of a noisy environment impeding performance, especially for ED and surgical staff. Privacy concerns for patients and staff were vital for physician dictation rooms, phone call rooms, triage rooms, check-in areas, registration, and patient bays. Several clinicians mentioned adding doors to the bays or private patient rooms in the ED to improve patient privacy (Figure 9). The ED and surgical staff reflected that the curtain between beds was insufficient for patient privacy. Patient privacy was also essential for registration\u0002check-in staff, as one staff noted: “we need some\u0002thing better for patient privacy instead shouting information out to everyone.”     According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2017), the number of older people in the United States will rise from 46.2 million to 80.8 million by 2040. Approximately 15% of adults ages 50 and older experience mental health illness (National Institute of Mental Health, 2020). The healthcare industry is rapidly changing to meet the needs of this growing aging population and achieve the fundamental patient-centered goals of healthcare. To that point, there has been growing research focusing on the relationship between the built environment and staff’s work satisfaction and patients’ wellbeing (Dijkstra et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2019). The human relationship with the built and natural environment is extensively discussed by architects and designers (Norouzi et al., 2019), public health scholars, psychologists (Reavey et al., CONTACT Neda Norouzi neda.norouzi@utsa.edu School of Architecture and Planning, University of Texas at San Antonio, 501 W Cesar E Chavez Blvd, San Antonio, TX 78207, USA.  2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 2024, VOL. 38, NO. 1, 1–17 https://doi.org/10.1080/26892618.2022.2125476 2017), medical professionals and health geographers (Kearns & Moon, 2002). These fields offer a unique perspective with an empirical and theoretical understanding of healthcare settings. However, there remains a significant gap in knowledge pertaining to the architecture of psychiatric geriatric care (PGC) centers and its impact on staff and patients. This study evaluates the impact of the built environment on staff’s work satisfaction and geriatric psychiatric patients’ health and wellbeing. It also assesses the importance of treating mental and physical illness of older adults in the same clinical setting. Psychiatric hospitals are being transformed to positively impact patients’ experience, wellbeing, and recovery (Chrysikou, 2019). Older adults with psychiatric problems tend to have more physical health issues than those without mental health illnesses (Daumit et al., 2002; Prior et al., 1996). The impact of aging complicates the diagnosis and treatment of mental health, and therefore increases their time spent in a hospital bed (Harrell, 2002). Thus, there is a higher risk of morbidity and mortality for psychiatric patients with physical illness (Sprah et al., 2017). However, transferring patients between psychiatric care and medical hospital settings can result in challenges when care is not provided in the same location. Examples of medical challenges that can be avoided by providing mental and physical care services in the same hospital include a reduction in: (a) the prevalence of prescribing omissions from 64.7% to 11.2% and (b) inappropriate prescription of medicines from 77.3% to 18.6% (Lang et al., 2012). The prevalence of chronic health conditions in older adults with mental illness and the challenges in providing care present an immediate need for research to guide the design of integrated mental and physical health care for older adults, to ameliorate the long-lasting impact of mental and physical illness (Jones et al., 2004). Until recently, the design of most care environments for older adults has been based on previous models or information from care staff and architects without input from the older adults themselves (Norouzi et al., 2019; O’Malley et al., 2017). This article presents findings from a study assessing the environmental requirements of a PGC unit by analyzing existing geropsychiatric hospitals and directly interviewing staff and older adult patients about their needs regarding the built environment to ensure their preference will be considered in the future design of these centers. These finding were then incorporated into creating a hypothetical design model of a PGC center to be used as an example by other hospital owners and designers. Materials and methods Study setting Three psychiatric hospitals, Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C, with similar settings and designated geriatric wings, participated in this study. 2 N. NOROUZI The original design of each hospital campus included multiple wings, one of which was dedicated to geriatric patients. For the purposes of this study, geriatric patients are those who are either over 65 years old or younger but have major neurological impairments, making it difficult for them to care for themselves (defined by a geriatric psychiatrist interviewed for this study). Site selection was based on hospital typology, status as a state facility, and approval from the hospital’s superintendent or institutional review board. Ethical approval Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the first author’s university. Authorization to conduct the study was obtained in each PGC center. Each participant signed a written consent form after being informed of the description and objectives of the study, the voluntary nature of participation, the ability to withdraw at any time, and the audio recording of the interviews. Participation in the study was confidential, and required measures were implemented to ensure data protection. Data collection Data were collected through two sources of behavioral observation/mapping and interviews. Behavior observation/mapping Observation is an ideal way to study nonverbal human behavior, expressions, postures, and the physical environment of a space (Lipson-Smith & McLaughlan, 2022). Behavior observation/mapping is an objective method of noting actions, attitudes, and social interactions within the built environment. It provides data related to characteristics of the environment, including type, time, place, and the people involved in each activity. The research team used place-centered mapping to observe and record different activities and interactions that took place in the “community living room” of each geriatric unit. Each hospital had just one community living room per unit. The square footage of the community living rooms for all hospitals was similar. However, the common space in Hospital C was adjacent to a secure outdoor balcony. Observations were recorded by sketching people in each space and marking different activities on the architectural plan of that space (e.g., Figure 1). Observation method of different behaviors was based on different type and level of interactions. Each observation session was conducted by two researchers and lasted for three hours. Table 1 presents definitions for different behaviors that were observed and recorded. JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 3 Interviews Interview questions were developed using the research team’s initial analysis of 60 articles related to mental healthcare. The issues that emerged from the literature analysis led to questions focused on the use of the building including an onsite medical care unit, the impact of the built environment on staff’s safety and comfort, and patients’ wellbeing and recovery. Interview questions were not pilot tested or provided to interviewees prior to the interview. Interviews were semi-structured and recorded for verbatim transcriptions. Interviewee recruitment consisted of emailing hospital superintendents and asking for participation. After the initial agreement, the superintendent sent a general email to all employees inviting them to participate in the study. The email body included the first names and affiliations of the research team members, a female assistant professor as the first author and a male graduate student, and their objectives for the study. The email also stated that the interviewees’ responses will be used in presentations and publications to inform design decisions for future PGC centers. The research team connected with interviewees and built rapport by spending time in each hospital, observing, and talking to employees and patients one day prior to starting the interview process. Employees who were interested in participating in the study expressed their willingness by responding to the email. Staff interviews lasted between 45 and 60 min. Patient interviewees were recruited through the director of patients’ rights within each hospital. The only patients who participated were the ones who were able to provide consent and comprehend the interview process and questions. All patient interviews were conducted in the presence of a staff member familiar with that patient to ensure the safety and comfort of both the patient Figure 1.

NOROUZI and the interviewer. Each interview lasted between 15 and 20 min. All patients interviewed for this study were aged 65 or older and none of the participants dropped out. Although difficult to determine a specific number for sample size in grounded theory studies, 10–60 is a typical number of participants reported (Starks & Trinidad, 2007). The research team of this study continued interviewing participants until they agreed on both code and meaning saturation (Aldiabat & Le Navenec, 2018). The interviewers discussed the responses after every 10 interviews were conducted. These discussions were brief and mostly focused on whether the team was collecting and learning new information. Though some information were repetitive among patient responses, there was enough differences to convince the interviewers to continue until they “heard it all” and fully understood all the issues raised by the interviewees (Hennink et al., 2017). The interviewees included 15 patients and 29 doctors, nurses, and therapists. Additional participants, unique to each hospital, included peer support personnel (2), patients’ rights staff (2), environmental services staff (1), dietitians (2), geriatric mental health service providers (3), activity coordinator (1), and administrators (4). The research team was not informed of anyone refusing to participate in the study and none dropped out after the initial agreement. Data analysis This research uses a constructivist grounded theory methodology. Constructivist grounded theory responds to questions of how, when, and to what extent the study is involved with other positions, networks, and situations (Charmaz, 2008), as well as how, when, and to what extent the study, both data collection and analysis, is influenced by the relationships and experiences of participants and the point of views, perspectives, positions, and interactions of the researcher (Charmaz, 2014). In this study, some of the participants from Hospital A and C had spent time in other psychiatric hospitals, which led to a specific perception and position on how the built environment could be designed to enhance the quality of life for older adults. An example of these environmental features was an onsite medical unit. Constructivist grounded theory is used in this study to develop an explanatory theory of the influence of the built environment on staff and patients as well as the necessity of an onsite medical unit within a PGC. Although constructivist grounded theory is not traditionally used for creating design models, it is useful in architectural research as it generates a new substantive concept (Lianto, 2019) and has been used to propose architectural design process (Norouzi et al., 2019). JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 5 Behavior observation/mapping analysis Through side-by-side comparison and assessment of the detailed sketches of patients’ daily activities with the notes taken of the same event, the research team coded the placement of architectural features, layout of furniture, location of patients in relation to one another, types of activities taking place, and length of time for each activity. Interview analysis Members of the research team individually read, re-read, and conducted line-by-line and focused coding of the transcriptions while examining the data for ideas, thoughts, feelings, issues, and challenges mentioned by the interviewees (Charmaz, 2008). For example, one of the patients said, “It doesn’t matter if I have my own bedroom, but I want my own locked drawer and a TV.” One member of the research team coded this line as ownership and another coded it as patient preference. During the focused coding this was discussed and agreed to be coded as patient needs and then categorized under autonomy. These preliminary codes were analyzed and grouped based on meaning similarities. For example, access to family visitation rooms, multi-religion/spiritual place, and shared dining room were coded as connection and single patient bedrooms and bathrooms were coded as privacy. The identified subcategories of connection and privacy were then placed under autonomy as a major category. Categories and subcategories were organized to reflect the users’ perception of how the design of the hospital influenced their daily activities (Tolley et al., 2016). This process verified some of the categories found in the literature but also permitted the emergence of new categories. All categories were then juxtaposed with the notes and sketches from behavior observation/mapping and reanalyzed through triangulation of various data sources, multiple discussion, and integration of memos (Glaser, 1978) to develop theoretical coding. For example, the behavior mapping illustrated that many patients were watching television while a doctor was having a private conversation with a patient in the same space. While patient interviewees did not mind conversing with doctors in public spaces, the staff requested multiple therapy spaces of different sizes. The juxtaposition of these findings resulted in the recommendation of adding smaller common spaces and multiple therapy rooms for each unit. Another example that emerged from literature analysis, patients’ descriptions of other hospitals, and eager response of interviewees was the need for an onsite medical unit that serves patients’ physical needs. Although, the research team did not have any behavior/observation mapping data on this topic, the number of interviewees requests and inquires for an onsite medical unit was precise and clearly justified by both patients and staff. Example of these responses 6 N. NOROUZI include “psychiatric hospitals vary widely in their ability to take care of patients’ medical needs and it is difficult to decide where to admit a patient with both medical and psychiatric illnesses, so many of these patients usually take longer to heal [ … ] This is even worse for older adults because they are probably more fragile” said a psychologist from Hospital A, and “we need to make sure the older patients are physically healthy and able to participate in therapeutic interventions for their mental health, so we examine them often. But if they get sick, we send them to a different hospital to be treated. This means either their mental or physical health needs to be on hold at any given time” said a nurse from Hospital C. The research team triangulated interviewees’ responses with the literature analysis findings and created the subcategory of medical care unit under the category of safety. During this stage, the research team compared notes and sketches from behavioral mapping with interviewees’ description of a space or expectation of a place to acquire a comprehensive understanding of user’s needs that led to the development of theoretical coding. The research team discussed all the final codes, categories, and subcategories to reach 100% agreement that led to theoretical coding. Results and discussion Theoretical coding The results of this study reveal a relationship between the architectural design of a PGC center and the wellbeing of geropsychiatric patients and the safety of staff as well as the need for a medical care unit at a PGC center. The assessment of the behavior observation/mapping notes and sketches resulted in specific spatial qualities that could positively contribute to or hinder staff and patients’ behavior, especially when juxtaposing with the results of staff and patient interviews. Below is the discussion of how the findings of this study contributed to the theoretical code and incorporated in the architectural design model. Table 2 presents an example of the existing architectural qualities of common spaces in each hospital and how these features affected different types of interactions. The behavior observation/mapping of the common space in Hospital A reveals activity limitations for patients and an unsafe and uncomfortable setting for staff. The architectural qualities of this space, presented in Table 2, prevent any interactive peer interactions and present the need for private nooks within the public spaces, similar to what Wang and Brockmole titled “nested environments” (2003). The results of the patients’ interviews confirm their need for privacy both within the framework of their private rooms and in the common spaces. JOURNAL OF AGING AND ENVIRONMENT 7 The common space of Hospital B is near the open nurse station, which is a prime location for patient interaction with staff and other patients (Jovanovic et al., 2019). Although patients preferred the common space near the nurse station, their interview responses emphasize their desire for control and privacy. Examples of these statements are: “I like being around other people but not always with them” and “I like to make friends and do different things, […] because everyone is different and sometimes we like to be alone in our room, sometimes with a lot of people.” This verified the need for private spaces within each public space. The common space of Hospital C is adjacent to an outdoor balcony and offers a great combination of an indoor-outdoor connection that could potentially provide opportunities for different types of interaction. However, this space was too small for any type of gathering and the behaviors observed by the research team were only solitary, wandering, or parallel peer where patients were walking around aimlessly or sitting close to one another but not interacting with each-other. This led to the decision of creating large common spaces that are modifiable and allow for change in the use of space when needed. The result of the staff interviews presented the immediate need for physical and psychological safety of the staff, and their comfort. Interviewees’ requests included centrally located nursing stations, multiple entry therapy rooms, and private spaces to work, exercise, and rest. Table 3 presents the properties and subcategories of the categories identified by the staff. Table 2. Examples of behaviors in common spaces of different hospitals. Hospital Behavior Space Qualities of space A S, PP, IS, W Common space Lobby area surrounded by main building entrance on the south, offices on north and west and the unit’s enclosed nurse station on the north—in addition to being used as a corridor, the space is used as a TV room by patients. It is too small for the number of patients, especially if they are interested in different types of activities during their free time, with minimum natural light and almost no view of the outside. B IP, IS, W, S, PP Common Space Living room placed in the center of the four patients wings and next to an open nurse station, including small sitting areas but no large tables—this allowed patients to stand around the nurse’s desk, interact with staff and their peers. C S, W, PP Common Space with Outdoor Balcony A well-lit space with multiple seating arrangements for two or three people to sit at each setting. This space was adjacent to a kitchenette that led to a fenced outdoor balcony—these three spaces gave patients choices but not enough options for interaction and, as a result, most patients were wandering or seating individually. Note: S: Solitary; PP: Parallel peer; IP: Interactive peer; IS: Staff; W: Walking/Wandering. 8 N. NOROUZI Centrally located nursing stations can serve as a landmark in geriatric patients’ wayfinding (O’Malley et al., 2022), and open nursing stations connect patients and staff and provide a sense of freedom (Southard et al., 2012). The nurses interviewed for this study expressed mixed feelings about open nursing stations, as these limit confidentiality and concentrated workspace. The chief nurse at Hospital A said, “You can never get everyone to agree but the bottom line is that staff need to feel safe and have space to do their job without compromising patient information.” Multiple staff members emphasized the fact that some patients stay in the hospital for longer periods of time, and it is therefore important to offer them a “home-like” environment. A registered Nurse from Hospital B said “We call the open space adjacent to the nurse station the living room, so it needs to feel like a home with family members who trust each-other. If we sit behind a glass wall and close ourselves to patients, we are telling them that they are not trustworthy.” The interviewees acknowledged that open nurse stations offer opportunities for more positive socializing and exchange as well as direct verbal communication between staff and patients. This leads to a decrease in aggression toward staff (Southard et al., 2012) and significantly reduces the patients’ number of seclusion episodes (Oostermeijer et al., 2021). Therapy rooms with multiple entrances offer the staff opportunities of escape when needed. In describing how a staff member might get stuck Table 3.

If the patient decides to block the door and harm the staff, there is no place for them to go. The staff is trapped back there. If the room has two doors, the staff can use the second door to leave. Others could also enter to help.” A music therapist described the benefit of multiple entrances for patients and said, “Some patients wander and with double doors, they can go in one door and out the other. I see this happen often during group therapy sessions. The patient wants to stay in the session but doesn’t have the patience.” Private spaces were recognized by the staff as areas separated from patients. One of the nurses said, “It is hard to complete charts and focus on patient’s recovery plan in an office that patients can access. Even with the door closed, someone will bang on the door; we need a private workroom.” A performance program supervisor talked about the importance of staff safety and rejuvenation and said that “it is critical to have a comfort room for staff.” One of the nurses who worked as a Personal Need Allowance (PNA) said, “It will be great to have a space for staff that experience trauma or a stressful situation so they can go there and breathe, meditate, and relax before getting back to work.” Staff interviewees also talked about the benefit of a having a gym on campus. A director of environmental services at Hospital C talked about the outdoor walking trails for patients and added, “But staff can’t really walk there without being approached by patients. It will be nice to have a place with equipment for exercise and showers.” Staff interviewees often talked about patients’ physical and psychological needs. A psychologist said, “We have four patients in each room but even though the rooms are spacious, there is absolutely not enough space for four people who might be mad at each-other. The best-case scenario is to have at least 50% of the bedrooms be private and the others be double for patients who prefer to have a roommate.” Patients interviewed for this study talked about their urgent need for spaces that offer privacy while providing opportunities to connect, places to rest and heal, and areas of exploration and discovery, such as sensory rooms. One of the patients said, “I was in a different hospital before and we had a gym, a print shop there. I was the supervisor and helped other patients print shirts for their family. It was nice to have something to do.” Another patient talked about the difficulty of meeting her family on campus due to the shortage of private visiting rooms. Table 4 presents the properties and subcategories of the four categories that emerged from patients’ data. 10 N. NOROUZI Medical unit in PGC center The hospitals included in this study did not have a medical care unit. However, the results of the literature analysis and the data collected from the interviews conducted for this study presented an imperative need for a medical care unit connected to the PGC center. Some patient interviewees talked about their physical health needs and the inconvenience of having to travel to a medical care facility outside of the hospital to receive care. Staff members described the challenges in responding to patients’ medical needs and enthusiastically requested an onsite medical care unit. The geriatric psychologist said, “The geriatric unit is generally slower and calmer. But one main issue is the patients’ medical needs. So, we really need to have a space with hospital beds and equipment to take care of those patients without sending them outside of the state hospital and delaying the mental Table 4.

I need to have my oxygen level adjusted but for that I have to go to another hospital and that’s really hard.” The superintendent talked about the difficulty of communication and information transfer between medical and psychiatric hospitals when patients must leave and return. Multiple therapists disclosed their concern about the gap in patients’ psychiatric treatments while they are in the medical hospital. Design model for PGC center The findings of this study resulted in creating a replicable design model and architectural base for future PGC centers. The essential discoveries that informed this model include providing visibility, accessibility, and rejuvenation for staff while respecting patients’ autonomy, atmosphere, boundary, and safety. This model was developed in three phases. The first version was created by two architecture students under the supervision of the principal investigator. This version of the model included a central public space that connected two psychiatric wings and nursing stations. This model was presented to a team of experts including architects, nurses, doctors, and patients’ caregivers. The main concern voiced about this version of the model was the lack of funding for two nurse stations. The design team then revised the model and presented a second version with one central nurse station connecting two psychiatric wings to the team of experts. The second presentation and multiple discussions between the author and the expert team led to the latest version of this model (Figure 2) illustrated below. This version was developed by the author and approved by the expert team. The design model incorporates the theoretical code developed in this study and includes a central nurse station that offers staff maximum visibility and unobtrusive surveil of entire unit while providing a safe space to plan activities and coordinate with other staff. Accessibility is safely provided through (a) multiple entrances and exits in each therapy room so that staff can keep the patients in the room if necessary, while also offering them the opportunity to leave and return (Simonsen & Duff, 2020), b) 12 N. NOROUZI adequate lighting in all areas, (c) central spaces for staff to meet with patients and receive quick help if necessary, and (d) use of anti-ligature material and furniture. This model responds to the staff’s need for rejuvenation by dedicating a section of the building to staff members. This section includes private offices, indoor/outdoor breakrooms, multiple restrooms, a workout area, a medication room, and an open nurse station with a clear line of sight to all wings. The offices are in the back and away from patients so the staff can work privately. This model respects patients’ autonomy by offering a sense of privacy and dignity through single bedrooms with private bathrooms (Ulrich et al., 2018), access to semi-private outdoor courtyards, and semi-private seating areas within indoor common spaces, private visitation rooms for patients and their families (Jovanovic et al., 2019), multiple private meeting rooms for private conversations between doctors and patients and their families (Jenkins et al., 2015), and a series of waist-high walls throughout the unit to promote mini conversations and to construct nested environments where a patient can be alone in public (Christenfeld et al., 1989). This model provides smaller public spaces for each wing while maintaining the large central public space as a community living room. The small public spaces with abundant natural light also offer patients opportunities for positive social engagement (Ulrich et al., 2008) or to quickly separate themselves from problematic situations that might be happening in a hallway (Espinosa et al., 2015). These additional choices of different places to be and activities to engage in can help prevent boredom, increases meaningful communication with peers and staff, and reduces social isolation, all of which are common challenges for geropsychiatric hospitals (Jovanovic et al., 2019). This model also offers a medical care unit connected to one of the geropsychiatric wings. This wing is divided into two sections via double doors; the first section closest to the nurse station includes eight private patient rooms for geropsychiatric care and the second section includes six private rooms with hospital beds and the equipment needed to take care of patients’ medical needs. This section can be closed off and separated in case of an infectious disease outbreak and the need for quarantining several patients     Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 are among the young population with the highest percentage of mental illness (McGorry et al., 2013). However, only 20% of the 15 million American adolescents with mental illness receive care with less than half of them receiving proper treatment 1 Department of Architecture, University of Texas at San Antonio, TX, USA Corresponding Author: Neda Norouzi, PhD, School of Architecture + Planing, University of Texas at San Antonio, 501 W.

One of the main challenges contributing to the limited services is the inadequate design of adolescent psychiatric hospitals (McGorry et al., 2013). The impact of the built environment on patients’ mental health was first studied in the 1950s (Evans, 2003). Today, after almost a century, there is still limited information focused on the cultural and developmental needs of adolescent psychiatric patients from the built environment (McGorry et al., 2013). This study focuses on improving adolescent psychiatric hospital design in a way that directly responds to their needs. There are major differences between the needs of adolescent and children or adults in a psychiatric hospital. Although individuals under the age of 18 are considered children and may all share the need of parental support, adolescents require more control and peer socialization (Borg-Laufs, 2013). While previous studies have proven the impact of the built environment of a psychiatric hospital on patients’ positive interactions and feeling of control and safety, there is a lack of focus on designing adolescent-specific psychiatric hospitals. This has led to many adolescents getting admitted to adult or children’s units (Blumberg & Devlin, 2006; Hutton, 2005). In a psychiatric hospital, adolescents spend most of their time in a patient unit under strict supervision by staff (Chun et al., 2016). Although this strict supervision is necessary for patients’ safety, it often leads to aggression and severely disruptive behavior (Hallman et al., 2014) toward the staff member working at the hospital. Staff who work in adolescent psychiatric hospitals may face multiple forms of hostility, aggression, and assault, collectively referred to as workplace violence that is often triggered by patients (Hallman et al., 2014; Ulrich et al., 2018). Studies on environmental impacts suggest that the built environment affects patients’ well-being and safety as well as staff’s satisfaction, working condition, safety, and health (Sheehan et al., 2013; Trzpuc et al., 2016). However, most previously published articles are either focused only on adolescent psychiatric hospitals (Hutton, 2005; Gubbels et al., 2016) or staff members working in these hospitals (Duque et al., 2020; Hallman et al., 2014). To our knowledge, there are no articles focused on the impact of the built environment on both staff and patients. To bridge this gap, the authors of this study analyzed existing scholarly articles and conducted interviews at three different state hospitals with adolescent patient units. Participants’ responses to interviewer prompts highlighted specific architectural categories that can be applied to designing adolescent psychiatric hospitals. Method This study investigates the influence of the built environment on the health and well-being of adolescent patients and staff of adolescent psychiatric hospitals. The first author responded to a request for proposal from one of the hospitals for which she received funding. All procedures were approved by an institutional review board (IRB). The site selection began by a web search to identify state psychiatric hospitals that have an adolescent program. The first author then emailed an invitation to the superintendent of eight hospitals and asked for their participation. Five hospitals responded, three of which got approval from their review boards to participate in the study. These hospitals (Hospitals A, B, and C) are in urban setting of different states. Data Collection The data collection for this article was conducted through two phases of (1) literature analyzing and (2) interviews. The research team searched for articles published between 2000 and 2020 in the databases of PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, and Cambridge Core. The key words included architecture of psychiatric hospitals, adolescent psychiatric hospitals, the built environment, architecture, interior design, environmental design, and hospital design. The article elimination process was first through the title, followed by the relevancy of the abstract, and finalized by the review of the full manuscript. The result was 62 articles of which 22 were analyzed in-depth. Studies were included if they were (1) peer-reviewed and published in English, (2) reported design aspects of the hospital 104 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4) environment, and (3) explored the impact of the built environment on patients or staff. After potential studies were selected, the authors read and analyzed the articles individually to create a list of identified design qualities. Interviews included questions about the participants’ use of the built environment; their needs from different sections of the hospital; and the impact of the environment on wellbeing, safety, and productivity of patients and staff. After the site selection and IRB approval from the hospital, the first author emailed each hospital’s superintendent and used snowballing techniques to identify and contact other participants. This technique is commonly used in qualitative research and requires a key participant to identify and contact other participants (Daly, 2007). The interviewees of this study include administrators, adolescent psychologist and psychiatrist, nurses, therapists, and peer support personnel. Sixty-nine individuals were interviewed as part of the larger study. For this analysis, only individuals who had daily interaction with adolescent patients were included in analysis (n ¼ 30). Each interview lasted between 30 and 45 min. Adolescent patients were not interviewed for this study. The interviews collected qualitative data focused on attitudes toward the existing environment, perception of safety and support, patient interaction and recovery plans, and staff’s need for rejuvenation and recovery. Data Analysis To establish and ensure the validity of study findings, the authors triangulated multiple data sources of literature and interviews that led to the development of a comprehensive understanding of the findings. The analysis of the literature was based on the narrative synthesis method (Popay et al., 2006) with a preliminary synthesis done individually by each author to identify and create a list of design qualities. The results were then combined, checked, modified, and verified to achieve 100% agreement by all authors. Decisions of which themes should be included were based on this study’s research question. Qualitative interviews were recorded using an iPad and transcribed verbatim by the authors into a word document. After the first author read and de-identified the transcriptions, each author analyzed the transcriptions using a grounded theory approach that included line-by-line coding, axial coding, and comparative theoretical coding (Glaser, 1992). The authors first assigned a code to each relevant line of the transcriptions to identify ideas, thoughts, feelings, and issues mentioned by respondents (Charmaz, 2008). The codes were then sorted and compared across the responses to draw connections between created codes. This axial coding formulated categories of the codes that are most responsive to this study’s research question and trimmed away excess codes. The next phase was comparative theoretical coding (Halberg, 2006) among the sets of data collected from the three different hospitals. This process led to systematic connection and contextual arrangement of the categories. The results were initially coded and categorized by each author and then combined, checked, modified, and verified to achieve 100% agreement by all authors. Results and Discussion The findings of literature analysis triangulated and juxtaposed with the results of the interview analysis informed a set of environmental design conditions that captures the complexity and connectedness of architectural design and the occupants of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Colligating the data revealed a relationship between the built environment and the success of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Findings suggest adolescent psychiatric hospitals must offer safe and welcoming environments that support patients’ healing and recovery as well as staff’s satisfaction. In this study, the environmental conditions of the hospital are divided to specific needs of patients and staff. Table 1 presents all categories that emerged from the data, how each category is defined in this study for adolescent patients and staff, and several subcategories that were developed through constant comparative techniques.

Colligating the data revealed a relationship between the built environment and the success of an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Architectural Composition The architectural composition of an adolescent psychiatric hospital should respond to adolescents’ psychological needs and healing process to prepare them for life outside the hospital. It is important to design the hospital in a way that patients can freely and safely move between spaces, participate in different types of therapeutic activities, and interact with each other and staff (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019; Liddicoat, 2019). One of the participants of this study told the interviewer that “it is important to offer adolescents control over their environment and activities [ ... ] to builds up their self-esteem and help them make friends.” Some of the major concerns for adolescents with mental illness are academic difficulties, low educational achievement, low employment, social exclusion, and possible homelessness (Preyde et al., 2018). The director of patients’ rights described an ideal adolescent psychiatric hospital as a small town where buildings surround a courtyard and there is a residential unit, a school, and a therapy mall that includes various therapy rooms, a movie theater, a pharmacy, a gift store, and a restaurant to resemble a typical community outside of the hospital. This enclosed and city-like campus setting provides a serene, secure, and structured environment where adolescents can move on the path of recovery and benefit from the residential setting, academic programming, and recreational activities. These components contribute to the “overall success of the patients’ diagnostic process, treatment plan, and the adolescents’ life outside of the hospital,” said one of the psychologists interviewed for this study. The architectural composition of an adolescent psychiatric hospital should respond to adolescents’ psychological needs and healing process to prepare them for life outside the hospital. Accessibility. The interview results presented that adolescents’ access to different services is one of the main concerns in state hospitals. These hospitals generally serve both adolescents and adults on the same campus but are required to keep the two populations completely separated for safety and security reasons. Therefore, adolescent units are built in a separate building and often far away from the adults’ units and the treatment mall, where the medical and therapeutic services are centralized. Funding limitations often lead to building one treatment mall to be shared by both populations but placed closer to adult units due to the higher number of patients. A social worker from Hospital A said that “it’s difficult to bring the children [to the treatment mall] from all the way on the other end of the hospital campus,” and the music therapist from the same hospital suggested that adolescents “need to have their own therapy spaces, a music room, art room, physical activities and a gym so they can stay active.” The adolescent unit at Hospital B was close to the rest of the campus and separated only by a courtyard, allowing patients to share all campus resources by using them at different times. The director of environmental services from this hospital said, “the kids have their own playground, but all the sports are shared and that works when we have enough staff.” While staffing is a challenge that designers do not have control over, they can address campus layout and access to a treatment mall. One solution is to build a smaller treatment mall with specific programs only for adolescent patients, while keeping some of the larger activities such as a basketball court in the main treatment mall for everyone to share. Norouzi et al. 107 ... build a smaller treatment mall with specific programs only for adolescent patients, while keeping some of the larger activities such as a basketball court in the main treatment mall for everyone to share. Adjacency. Participants expressed the need for staff’s visual and audible access to patients from the nurse station as a necessity of the hospital design. Adjacency of communal spaces with the nurse stations offers patients an increased feeling of freedom and security (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019) which can help adolescents develop independence, provides a safe space for them to gather around (Shepley et al., 2016) to increase opportunities for positive interaction, and have a higher level of connection with staff (Shattell et al., 2008). This also allows staff to monitor patients more closely and offer “comfortable seating for quiet activities near the nurse stations,” said a nurse at Hospital A. While staff have varying opinions on open or closed nurse stations, “patients mostly prefer open without any barrier such as a plexiglass panel,” said one of the activity nurses at Hospital C. A nurse manager of the adolescent unit at Hospital B stated “instead of a glass bubble, we have an open desk in front where patients gather to talk, read, or work on a puzzle. The nurses’ offices are in the back of the hub.” Efficiency. To better serve patients, staff need clear and quick access to different sections of the adolescent unit as well as different buildings of the hospital. Circulation and campus planning impact both functional and psychological aspects of the workflow by providing fundamental support to ease the hardship of everyday routines (Jiang, & Verderber, 2016). It is important to consider the fastest and safest path for staff to move between essential locations for patient care and self-care. Multiple staff members in Hospital A voiced their concerns about unnecessary distance and wasted time between the adolescent unit and other units of the hospital when they need to respond to emergencies. Interior layout. It is important to recognize the appropriate spatial layout and physical spaces of an adolescent psychiatric hospital in a way that serves both patients and staff. An open floor plan is more preferred as it increases face-to-face communication, team interaction, and interdisciplinary collaboration (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019; Liddicoat, 2019). The nurse manager from Hospital C said, “an open floor plan gives adolescents the freedom of moving in different spaces while monitored by staff without being told they can or cannot go somewhere. It is just easier for everyone.” Adolescents often have difficulties with interpersonal relationships, social situations, managing psychiatric symptoms, stigma, and bullying (Preyde et al., 2018). A physician at Hospital A talked about the importance of replicating family life and social activity in the community to encourage positive interactions with peers and improve adolescent patients’ sense of selfworth. An adolescent psychologist from Hospital C emphasized on the importance of active and passive behaviors for adolescent patients and said “there needs to be a place where they can run, be loud, be teenagers. But they also need a place to practice being calm.” Examples of interior spaces that promote active interaction include exercise and play areas for patients to get engaged in positive movement and exert physical energy (Trzpuc et al., 2016) and “supervised woodshop to express creativity with hands-on craft” said the director of vocational services in Hospital A. Spaces that inspire passive interactions include a library, a greenhouse, indoor plants, a spiritual room (interviewees), quiet rooms, sensory rooms, dayrooms, and patient rooms with front porches (Shepley et al., 2016). Offering different types of spaces provide adolescents a variety of privacy and opportunities to come together, socialize, and bond (Hutton, 2005). Versatility. Versatility is defined as a multipurpose space that includes built-ins with multiple uses and can be changed by a single user within minutes (Nanda et al., 2019). Flexible spaces provide options for spatial configuration and cater to a wide range of social activities for adolescent patients. Participants of this study asked for flexible interior spaces that can offer different activities such as “reading, relaxing, playing games, and watching TV” to help adolescents avoid 108 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4) boredom and afford them control over the type of activity they want to participate in. The Performance Program Supervisor of Hospital B expressed the need for larger rooms that can be easily divided and used for different therapy sessions at the same time. The music therapist of Hospital A said “musical instruments are expensive, and we cannot afford buying multiple of the same instrument for different units. So, we need a versatile space that allows the equipment in the same place to be used at different times.” Therefore, it is important to design versatile spaces with socio-petal furniture arrangements to promote positive social interaction, decrease isolation (Jovanovic´, 2019), facilitate personal space regulation, and provide occupants control of their environment (Shepley et al., 2016; Ulrich et al., 2018) in adolescent psychiatric hospitals. Wayfinding. The ability for adolescent psychiatric patients to successfully navigate through a care center is crucial for their daily routine activities. Wayfinding should be recognized as a high priority when designing psychiatric hospitals as it can be a challenge in large hospital campuses with several buildings that lack distinctive appearance (Devlin, 2014). Inadequate wayfinding and signage can cause aggression or abusive behavior among patients (Liddicoat, 2019). The adolescent psychologist from Hospital A emphasized the importance of wayfinding by saying “these are kids, and they have less patience than adults [ ... ] they need to go where they want and get what they want as quickly as possible.” A wayfinding system needs to be a navigable and readable environment (Shepley et al., 2017) and avoid “long corridors, repetitive elements, and changes of direction within the circulation system” (Devlin, 2014, pp. 425–426). Atmosphere Atmosphere is defined as an emotional reaction to a specific space and therefore cannot be directly constructed but emerges from the built environment and its impact on the occupants (Norouzi, 2016). Different architectural characteristics create different atmospheres (Norouzi et al., 2019). Examples of these characteristics are noise, color, material, texture, and form that influence spatial intimacy (Zumthor, 2006), privacy, and autonomy (Norouzi et al., 2019). It is important to consider the atmosphere of an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it enhances staff and patients’ satisfaction (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019) and wellbeing (Sheehan et al., 2013), increases social engagement (Trzpuc at al., 2016), and reduces stress (Ulrich et al., 2018). Acoustics. Sound and noise can range from stressful to soothing and therapeutic and impact staff, patients, and visitors of a hospital. An appropriate acoustic environment benefits staff’s well-being and patients’ therapy process (Zhou et al., 2020). However, appropriate acoustic design has not been a priority in psychiatric hospitals (Shepley et al., 2017). Unwanted sounds and noise such as traffic, trains, airports, and community noise within a hospital unit can hinder staff’s work productivity and communication quality with patients while causing psychological distress and helplessness among patients (Shepley et al., 2017; Ulrich et al., 2018). The director of admissions in Hospital B said, “we need a quiet therapeutic space as staff break room in each unit so they can relax and unwind but available to respond to emergencies when needed.” A physical therapist from Hospital C said, “the breeze through the trees, birds chirping, and sound of water create a calm environment for patients and staff. [ ... ], there needs to be a way to have pleasant sound both inside and outside the unit.” Incorporating acoustic floor and ceiling tiles, wall panels, movable partition panels, and solid core doors can mitigate unwanted noise transmissions (Liddicoat, 2019). Providing single bedrooms in adolescent psychiatric hospitals enhances privacy and reduces noise levels from adjacent patient neighbors (Ulrich et al., 2018). Indoor sensory rooms can provide opportunities for patients to listen to music or pleasant nature sounds. Autonomy. Autonomy, as independence or freedom of choice, is an element often forgotten in psychiatric hospitals and even more so for adolescents. Respecting patients’ autonomy starts by providing privacy options. Lack of privacy results in heightened anxiety levels, stress, and Norouzi et al. 109 aggression (Liddicoat, 2019). A way to provide privacy is through offering single bedrooms for patients. Single bedrooms with private bathrooms encourage social engagement (Trzpuc et al., 2016); offers therapeutic security and comfort, expression of ownership, opportunity to personalize and decorate the space (Shepley et al., 2017), and freedom to withdraw when feeling unwell (Jovanovic´ et al., 2019); and improve the dignity and safety of patients (Sheehan et al., 2013). Private bedrooms can provide a greater “sense of personal control and security,” said one of the interviewees. This can be provided by offering access to technology such as television for entertainment, phone, or computer to stay connected with family, control over the temperature of their room for comfort, private lockers to store their belongings in their bedroom, and most importantly options in the type of activities to be involved in. Perception. Offering choices increases an individual’s sense of control and can provide opportunities for patients to modify and personalize their environment based on personal perceptions (Bergamin et al., 2022; Pasha & Shepley, 2017). While this is important and possible for personal spaces, perception is based on interpretation of experiences (Pasha & Shepley, 2017) and varies for different people. Therefore, it is difficult to accommodate in designing public spaces. One of the most recognized topics in relation to psychiatric hospitals is creating a deinstitutionalized and homelike environment. Previous studies presented homelike environments can be created through light and soothing colors, cheerful and welcoming facade and entrances, use of local materials and design characteristics (Li, 2018), clean floors and comfortable furniture (Shepley et al., 2017), nontextured interior walls (Wang et al., 2020), view of nature and landscape painting (Evans, 2003), and indoor plants (Duque et al., 2020) to improve patients and staff’s satisfaction. Although these points are agreed upon in most research studies, the perception of the space is influenced by individuals’ associational meaning of the surrounding environment (Wang et al., 2020) and can be different for many individuals. Participants described a homelike environment as a comfortable place with “bright colors, familiar items from home, a way to listen to music and podcasts, natural light, comfortable flooring, nice variety of indoor plants, and outdoor gardens.” However, the concept of comfort was not defined by any of the participants. Another controversial subject related to perception is color. A music therapist interviewed for this study, said “bright colors could be very over stimulating because some folks have sensory deficits.” Yildirim et al. (2011) confirms this by stating that warm colors provoke active feelings and, in some cases, increase anxiety. Contrary to these statements, the chief of psychiatry in Hospital B suggested that “warmer colors are better than cool blues for the common areas because they encourage interaction and communication.” One staff member interviewed for this study said, “anything but light blues and greens [ ... ] that feels like an asylum from the old movies; very institutionalized, not homey at all,” but Yildirim et al. (2011) suggest that cool colors make the space feel peaceful, relaxing, and calm. Respite. In response to a highly stressful work environment of a psychiatric hospital and to contribute to the staff’s reduction of stress, burnout, and fatigue, while offering them opportunities to relax, focus, and concentrate (Nejati et al., 2015), it is important to create indoor and outdoor relaxation and rejuvenation areas specific to staff. Interviewees of this study asked for a balance between passive and active respite such as a meditation room and a basketball court. Areas of respite serve as a place to withdraw and seek refuge from patients and families along with allowing privacy and socialization with coworkers (Liddicoat, 2019). The staff break area should include artwork, indoor plants, windows with outdoor views and access to nature by offering opportunities to walk through gardens, receive direct sunlight, and listen to the sound of birds or water (Nejati et al., 2015). Interviewees of this study described the importance of incorporating access to covered patios, fitness areas, and outdoor walking trails and asked for centralized break rooms near work areas, so they can step away from a hectic work environment, think and regroup their thoughts. 110 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4) ... it is important to create indoor and outdoor relaxation and rejuvenation areas specific to staff. Lighting Exposure to light impacts the circadian rhythm which synchronizes the body’s internal clock and regulates the sleep cycle (Joseph, 2006). Inadequate exposure to light can lead to reduced cognitive abilities, anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue, stress, and depression, along with vulnerability to seasonal affective disorder (Evans, 2003; White et al., 2013). Therefore, integrating natural and artificial light in the design of an adolescent psychiatric hospital is essential for improving workplace performance for staff and enhancing patients’ recovery process. It is necessary to incorporate windows, and skylights allow natural light into the built environment (Jiang & Verderber, 2016) and select appropriate noninstitutional lighting fixtures to provide adequate light distribution for day and night usage. Artificial lighting. Lighting is linked with a sense of comfort and well-being. Consequently, when daylight is not sufficient, artificial lighting must compensate for and provide adequate lighting that extends the field of view in play areas for adolescent patients and creates ideal working conditions for staff. Electric lighting is used to positively impact mood, circadian rhythm, sleep cycle, and task performance and decrease depression and length of stay in a hospital (Shepley et al., 2017). Adequate exposure to artificial light is essential for night-shift staff in a psychiatric hospital as it readjusts their circadian rhythm and helps with irregular sleep–wake schedules that could lead to health problems (Joseph, 2006). Artificial lighting design considerations include glare and shadow-free light distribution, daylight sensors, dimmers, switch controllers, and high and uniform luminance. Natural lighting. Daylight should be prioritized when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital as it affects staff and patients’ physical and psychological health. Inadequate light has a direct effect on fatigue, insomnia, and other psychiatric diseases (Evans, 2003; Nabil & Mardaljevic, 2006; Shepley et al., 2016). Exposure to natural lighting can impact staff and patients by enabling performance of visual tasks (Peek-Asa et al., 2009), affecting mood and perception (Partonen & Lonnqvist, 2000), controlling the body’s circadian system and improving sleep cycle (Boubekri et al., 2014), decreasing aggression (Ulrich et al., 2014), depression, and anxiety as well as facilitating wayfinding (Evans, 2003; Liddicoat, 2019; Shepley et al., 2017). The music therapist in Hospital A mentioned the importance of integrating natural daylight in adolescent psychiatric hospitals and said, “the kids are generally happier and more willing to sit through the therapy session in the room with windows and sunlight.” Natural Environment Connection and access to the natural environment can positively impact physical and mental health of individuals by improving cognitive abilities, increasing the sense of belonging and self-worth (Hammell, 2021), helping patients focus on their inner healing resources, and offering staff a place of respite and visitors a relaxed setting to interact with loved ones (Marcus, 2007). Designing a connection to the natural environment in an adolescent psychiatric hospital can be accomplished through biophilic design with the goal of providing a healing environment that promotes wellbeing for staff and patients. This could be achieved by offering direct and indirect connections to natural elements and incorporating nature-centric spaces with activities ranging from passive to active (Marcus, 2007). Interviewees described nature-centric environments as spaces that include plants, trees, natural materials, artwork, color, water features, and animals. Interviewees also mentioned Zen gardens, planters, green courtyards, and walking trails as examples of places that provide opportunities for different levels of activities. Biophilia. Biophilic design focuses on incorporating nature into the built environment to advance people’s health, fitness, and well-being. Norouzi et al. 111 Integrating biophilia in the design of an adolescent psychiatric facility can promote passive and active interactions. Marcus (2007) lists these interactions as viewing the garden through a window, sitting outside, dozing/napping/meditating, gentle rehabilitation exercises, walking to preferred spots, raised bed gardening, and participating in sports. Designing passive connections to nature can create a temporary escape from an oppressive atmosphere, offering hope of rapid recovery, along with experiencing the change in time, throughout the day and improving the quality of daily routines for staff and patients (Nejati et al., 2015). An intervention coach from Hospital C said, “more open spaces with outdoor visibility and decorative paneling or paintings of nature in different spaces will help patients feel at peace.” Nature art presents distinct synergistic benefits that can impact the psychosocial well-being of patients by increasing self-esteem and decreasing social isolation (Thomson et al., 2020). Displaying nature art can reduce patient anxiety and agitation (Shepley et al., 2017) and decrease the use of anxiety medication (Nanda et al., 2019). The dentist in Hospital A said, “there’s a mural in our main walkway that has trees, koala bears, giraffes, and many patients love it” and “it makes them happy; it makes them think of something besides their delusions. It’s relaxing.” An adolescent patient who had learned about architects interviewing members of the hospital wrote a message and asked a nurse to deliver it to the research team. The note read, I like to see artwork that is made by some of us. There are people here, like this guy in my unit who draws very nicely. We can have his drawings on the wall. The big sculptures in the garden are nice too; specially to look at and relax on a sunny day. Courtyard. Courtyards, outdoor spaces surrounded by buildings, can provide opportunities for recreational activities, play, and gardening. Interviewees of this study requested having multiple small courtyards accessible to patients for different types of activities. It is important for adolescent patients to have a place to exert their energy throughout the day (Shepley et al., 2016), and they are most likely to be physically active in an outdoor environment that includes greenery (Gubbels et al., 2016). Patients with the opportunity to walk in a garden, be around diverse plants and flowers, listen to the sound of water, and receive direct sunlight are reported to be less stressed (Nejati et al., 2015). The interviewees of this study expressed interests for walking trails that are close to buildings where both patients and staff can go on daily walks. They also asked for outdoor areas that are set up for sports, relaxation, weight training, play structure, running, and biking, and outdoor shaded seating areas for staff. Although there were inquiries for different types of gardens, the most requested green spaces were therapeutic and vegetable gardens. Most interviewees indicated that attributes of a healing environment as spending time with plants and water features. These activities can reduce anxiety, provide positive distractions for patients, and offer them opportunities to be involved in their own recovery and healing process (Liddicoat, 2019). This can also allow staff to cope with bereavement, process stressful work situations, spend quality time, and work with adolescent patients outside of the hospital building (Marcus, 2007). Therapeutic gardens should provide views to the sky and changing cloud formations, a plentiful supply of plant materials with distinctive seasonal changes, subtleties of color and texture, with leaves or grass that move with the slightest breeze (Marcus, 2007), as well as safe water features where patients can see and hear the water but not drink it. Interviewees talked about the benefits of gardening and planting vegetables to be tremendous for patients as it could help them practice acceptance, understanding the process of growth, living in the moment, and eating healthy. Safety and Security Safety is a major factor in adolescent psychiatric hospitals, as patients can become violent and aggressive when irritated. Tense or escalating situations often arise between patients in psychiatric hospitals in which staff members need to intervene. Design features such as efficient visibility and circulation that maximizes line of sight throughout the facility, reduces blind spots from corridor nooks, and provides multiple exit points 112 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(4) that improve accessibility, as well as anti-ligature equipment, durable and heavy furniture, and shatterproof windows (Carr, 2017). Boundary. Physical indicators that define the use of space can allow for different types and levels of interaction by determining separations or offering connections (Norouzi et al., 2019). A nurse in Hospital C said, “boundaries are for connection as much as they are for separation [... ], windows connect the patients to the outdoors even on a hot day when they can’t go outside.” The nurse continued by saying: Windows from the patients’ room to the hallway offer safety and privacy by allowing staff to check on patients without entering the room. Boundaries for separation are essential for safety and security to keep adolescents in their own healing environment and away from adult patients and the public. High risk. Equipment that can be used by patients for self-harm are considered high-risk factors. These can be eliminated with the appropriate use of durable building materials, damage-resistant furniture, and anti-ligature equipment (Carr, 2017; Shepley, 2017). The head nurse in Hospital A described the importance of avoiding sharp corners and objects used throughout the unit in which patients can use to harm themselves or others. Visibility. Patient visibility and efficient circulation are imperative when designing an adolescent psychiatric hospital, as it has a direct influence on the safety of staff and patients. A central nurse station within an adolescent unit is crucial for providing staff with maximum patient visibility (Shepley et al., 2016). Although open nurse stations provide better visibility and support staff capability to anticipate and prevent aggressive behavior (Ulrich et al., 2018), most staff members at Hospitals A and C said that they feel safer in enclosed stations. In other studies, decentralized nurse stations positively influenced proximity to patients in a larger design footprint as well as time spent with patients (Fay et al., 2017). Another important factor to consider are blind spots that can be created by walls or furniture. Interviewees suggested the use of convex mirrors or cameras to offer visibility. Although video surveillance provides additional security and can increase patients’ choice about monitoring options, it can have adverse effects on patients’ well-being and cause symptoms of fear, distrust, and paranoia (Appenzeller et al., 2019). These dubious facts are due to lack of imperial evidence and lead to difficulty in considering video surveillance beneficial or hindering. We recommend that future studies to consider representing adolescents in the design of psychiatric hospitals by including them in the interviews or surveys for data collection.     A healing environment aid recovery of the patient; reduce patient stress, and length of stay in hospitals [1]; have both physical and non-physical parameters. The parameters of healthcare environments include architectural design features; environmental attributes; air quality; noise; thermal comfort; privacy; natural light; outside view of nature; safety and security; and access to nature [2]. The parameters of the pediatric healthcare environment also include the creation of child-friendly environments [3], therapeutic play, family support and artwork for positive distraction. The parameters of a child-friendly environment have been investigated in a variety of ways to determine what makes an environment child-friendly [3,4]. The childcare facilities should be planned near schools and parks to have access to healthy, and safe surroundings; and visual links between the indoor and outdoor spaces are also important [5]. By incorporating the viewpoints of children, the physical, cultural, and social environments can be made child friendly. Children prefer to see healthcare facilities as a home-like environment, which includes family eating and kitchen facilities [6]. Experts also expressed the importance of flooring in childcare facilities to prevent patient fall. Nature and outside views, lower stress, allowing patients to recuperate quickly [7] and influence patient well-being. Garden visibility, accessibility, and the provision of child-sized furniture are all essential factors in encouraging garden use [8]. The garden visibility can be improved by placing colorful brochures in high traffic areas [9]. In addition, the outside views from the window can increase patient satisfaction [5]. Privacy during hospitalization can reduce anxiety, on the other hand, insufficient privacy may cause children to get stressed. While patients need privacy, staff members also need to see the patient, ensure their safety and wellbeing [10]. The patient’s privacy may be impacted by the space design, position of toilet and location of the patient’s bed and its interactions with other design elements [11,12]. Positive distraction has a significant effect in reducing patient stress and is found to be beneficial for children [13,14].

Installation of murals, virtual ponds, aquariums has been found to have physiological effects on the positive health outcomes of pediatric patients [17,18]. Play is critical for a child’s physical, social, and cognitive development. Shared, handheld play options pose a risk of infections, however, aquariums, and interactive media provides play opportunities for differently-abled children [13]. Atriums, waiting halls, hospital gardens and other public spaces be carefully designed to provide self-directed play activities [19]. Younger children and adolescents prefer distinct play zones based on their age and developmental stage [20]. The psychological and emotional support of family to a pediatric patient has been explored by many studies and it has been reported that the family has a significant role in the care process [21]. It is important to provide spaces where both patients and families can be effectively included in the patient room [22]. Children have more opportunities to do things i.e. play with toys, use a computer, and mingle with peers when they are in age-appropriate activity spaces [5,23]. Children must be kept safe from abduction and accidental collisions in childcare facilities. It is possible to create a safe environment with a sound-absorbing, slip-resistant floor by specifying materials that are both attractive and functional [24]. Nursing stations should be located in such a way so that nurses can keep eye on visitors [23]. A comfortable physical environment contributes significantly towards faster recovery and better health outcomes. Pelander [25], stressed the need of engaging the children in the process of care. Single bed patient rooms are comfortable in terms of social support and can substantially reduce noise and infection [26]. Adolescents feel discomfort with the crying of babies. Birch et al. [5], suggested segregating the baby wards from the wards of adolescents. Healthcare institutions must evaluate their design quality, optimize health environment design to increase efficiency, and create appropriate healing environments for patients. Although previous research has shown that design has a major impact on health outcomes, evidence-based design is still in its infancy [27]. It is critical for facility planners to address the experiences of sick children and their families while in the hospital [28]. India’s growing pediatric population and rising affordability highlight the need for better healthcare facilities in the country. Despite having the highest percentage of children aged 0 to 18 (39 % of the country’s population), India only has a few pediatric hospitals with basic infrastructure. Existing healthcare research has mainly focused on general hospitals rather than on specific hospitals i.e., pediatric hospitals and certainly not in the Indian context. Children are not small adults, and their needs are different in terms of their physiological and psychological characteristics, the findings of adult care facilities cannot be replicated in pediatric facilities. In India, childcare is delivered in a variety of hospital type: general hospitals with pediatric departments; stand-alone children’s hospital; and private clinics of pediatricians. There are many general and super speciality hospitals in the nation that treat patients of all age groups. However, these hospitals lack specific environment needed to provide optimal care to infants, children with a multidisciplinary approach centered on child. There are few stanalone children’s hospitals; two examples are 221 bedded, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitshalya (CNBC) in New Delhi; and 400 bedded and Post Graduate Institute of Child Health (PGICH) in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Although these institutions offer improved childcare, they fall short in many areas, such as creating a child friendly environment, therapeutic play, and family and peer support because there are no guidelines in place. The objective of this study is to create a framework for the design of pediatric healthcare facilities in the Indian context, to meet the industry’s pressing demand for making healthcare design evidence more accessible and actionable. This study reveals how pediatric healthcare surroundings have a major impact on patient quality of care, safety, and staff satisfaction and efficiency. The framework includes the design considerations for pediatric healthcare environments and can be used for design optimization for new and renovation projects. This article conceptualizes the healthscape quality of pediatric healthcare facilities in India using the Delphi consultation methodology and provides a framework, supported by evidence on how various factors affect the design quality. This construct considers not just the conventional healthscape criteria (i.e., layout, ambience, and texture) but also new dimensions appropriate for designing pediatric healthcare institutions (i.e., child-friendly environment; therapeutic play; artwork for positive distraction; and family & peer support). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Delphi method The Delphi method, developed at Rand Corporation in 1950 by Dalkey and Helmer, is a widely used iterative process and accepted method for convergence of opinion regarding real-world knowledge using a series of questionnaires requested from experts within specific issue areas [29]. The main objective of a Delphi study is to obtain consensus on the assessment of data from a group of respondents. A chosen set of respondents is questioned through a series of questionnaires and the results of the first round are used to generate the next round. As soon as questions for which respondent’s consensus are achieved, those questions are dropped. The second round of questioning is used to further explore any issues on which there is no consensus. The size of the expert’s panel and the response rate of the experts are important factors for Delphi consultation. According to Skulmoski [30], when the group is small, a smaller sample between ten to fifteen experts may yield sufficient results. There is no strict rule for panel size [31], the author discovered that in 56 % of prior Delphi research, the number of participants was up to 30. Two rounds of the Delphi-based consultation method were employed after the elements for design considerations were generated to reveal new aspects from Indian experts in related fields. In this Delphi consultation, 30 experts were employed in round one and 28 experts in round two. (Table 1). A 5-point Likert scale was used to collect expert feedback. Finally, after a thorough examination of experts’ opinions and statistical analysis, the final design considerations were compiled. 2.2. Identifying therapeutic goals and design considerations A review of the literature was conducted to identify therapeutic goals and design considerations. Using open-ended questionnaires, five experts were asked to provide their opinion related to the design of pediatric healthcare facilities to generate new ideas/concepts. This process yielded eight therapeutic goals and 34 design considerations (Table 2). Through interviews with professors, caregivers/doctors, healthcare architects, research fellows, research scholars and nurses feedback concerning pediatric healthcare design was obtained and their suggestions were incorporated to finalize the list of therapeutic goals and design considerations. A. Halim Babbu and M. Haque Ain Shams Engineering Journal 14 (2023) 101975 2 2.3. Measuring consensus Even though the primary goal of the Delphi technique is to achieve consensus between experts, there is no consistent measurement practice. As a result, some studies use a frequency distribution to measure agreements, while others use standard deviation and interquartile range [31]. According to Zervas [31], 10 points and 5 points Likert scale has been most commonly used in the previous studies. The consensus is said to be achieved by combining the following three measures in the case of a 5-point Likert scale. a) The 51 % of experts who answered ‘‘strongly agreed” in the category (which is between values 4 and 5 on a 5-point Likert scale) b) The interquartile range less than 1 c) The standard deviation (SD) is less than 1.5 [31]. According to Dajani et al. [32], the Coefficient of variation (CV) is another method of judging agreements. If the CV is in between 0 and 0.5, a good degree of consensus has been achieved and a second Delphi round is not needed; if the CV is in between 0.5 and 0.8, a consensus is less satisfactory and another round may be required; and if the CV is 0.8, it has a poor level of consensus [33].

Results SPSS software has been used to calculate mean, standard deviation (SD), interquartile range (IQR), coefficient of variation (CV), (Table 2); and boxplots (Figs. 1-8). 3.1. Child-friendly built environment It can be seen from Fig. 1, that A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7 have negative skew implying many experts awarded high scores compared to the average, and the mean values are in the range of 4 to 5. Table 2, and Fig. 1 shows good ratings (mean values), and good agreement (IQR = 1.0 each), which indicates consensus in the first round for A1, A2, A4, A5, and A7. Experts considered these factors as important. Positive skew is seen in A3, indicating a larger percentage of participants provided a lower score than the mean. IQR = 2.0 indicates that experts have a weak agreement, a consensus has not been achieved in the initial round. This factor was rephrased by specifying the singly loaded corridor with the view of the outside, which received a good score and strong agreement in the subsequent round. A6 has a lower score, week agreement (IQR = 2.3) and negative skew in the first round. Even after rephrasing the question, this factor didn’t achieve consensus in the second round (IQR = 2.0), as experts found it unfeasible to provide a family kitchen near-patient room in the Indian context, hence this factor is not included in the final list. 3.2. Nature and outdoors Fig. 2 and Table 2 show, all the factors scored high (mean value # 4 to 5) and have a strong agreement (IQR = 1.0). Except for B3, which has positive skew; B1, B2, B3, and B5 have a negative skew. The CVs lies less than 0.2 which indicates a good degree of consensus and no need to go for the second round. Experts agreed that the criteria: B1, B3 & B4 as important considerations. 3.3. Privacy Fig. 3 and Table 2 indicates negative skew, high score, and very strong agreement for C1. Privacy can be enhanced by providing attached toilets in patient rooms. C2 has a very low score and low median value, experts argued that providing all single-bed patient rooms in the Indian context is not a feasible option, hence this factor is not considered in the second round. C3 and C5 have negative skew, high scores & strong agreement (IQR) in the first round. Experts valued the installation of movable partitions in shared rooms as an important criterion. C4 and C6 have week agreements (IQR = 2.0) in the first round. These criteria were rephrased. In the second round, C4 & C6 got a high score, strong agreement, and CVs less than 0.16, which indicates consensus among experts. Inboard toilets provide better natural light and outside views to patient rooms. 3.4. Positive distraction D1 achieved a high score, positive skew which means many experts provided score lower than the mean but has got an acceptable level of agreement (IQR). Experts argued that the use of brightly colored items are encouraged in pediatric facilities but at the same time color choices differs among age groups. D2 has got a low score and weak agreement (IQR) in the first round, so this factor was rephrased, which received a high score and strong agreement in the next round. D3 and D4 received high scores, strong agreement, and negative skew. Experts agreed that wall-murals, virtual ponds, aquariums (D3), and drawing, and artwork can be used as a positive distraction strategy (Fig. 4, and Table 2). 3.5. Therapeutic play Fig. 5 and Table 2, show that E1 and E2 both received high scores, albeit E1 has a negative skew while E2 has a positive skew. Both have received strong agreement (IQR), experts agreed to provide distinct play zones based on the type of activity & age group (E1) and to provide non-contact play options to control infection (E2). E3 did not achieve a high score in the first round. In the second round, so this factor was rephrased, as ‘‘allow play items brought from home in the patient rooms\" which has got a high score and strong agreement. Fig. 1. Child-friendly built environment boxplots (x: mean value, -:, median value). Fig. 2. Nature and Outdoors boxplots (x: mean value, -:, median value). A. Halim Babbu and M. Haque Ain Shams Engineering Journal 14 (2023) 101975 4 3.6. Family and peer support F1, F2 and F3, all received high scores and overwhelming agreement in the first round. Fig. 6 and Table 2 show that F1 and F3 have negative skew, implying a large percentage of experts ranked greater than the average score. All three factors achieved consensus in the first round, and hence second round is not required. Experts viewed the presence of family and interaction with peers as an important characteristic. 3.7. Safety and security Fig. 7 and Table 2 indicate that all the three factors have achieved high scores, strong agreement, and positive skew, which means that experts viewed all the three factors as extremely important in terms of child safety. Placement of nursing stations in relation to patient rooms to have better visibility of patients has been recognized as an important design consideration. Fig. 3. Privacy boxplots (x: mean value, -:, median value). Fig. 4. Positive distraction boxplots (x: mean value, -:, median value). Fig. 5. Therapeutic play boxplots (x: mean value, -:, median value). A. Halim Babbu and M. Haque Ain Shams Engineering Journal 14 (2023) 101975 5 3.8. Comfort All the criteria’s related to patient comfort i.e., H1, H2 and H3 received high scores, strong agreement (IQR) and have negative skew, which indicates that experts strongly agree with all the factors. Comfortable patient rooms, segregation of baby wards from older patients, and nature views through windows have achieved strong consensus among experts and therefore the second round is not needed (Fig. 8 and Table 2).

Discussion This paper used a qualitative and quantitative approach to develop a framework for the pediatric healthcare facility. As the pediatric healthcare facility design is complex & multi-faceted, and the planning & decision making is also done by heterogeneous groups [38], inputs from multi-disciplinary experts were obtained to get a comprehensive perspective. The review of related literature and the opinion of the experts (concept generation round) paved the way for the further development of questionnaires for subsequent rounds of Delphi consultation. In the first Delphi round, 34 design considerations were presented across 8 domains. The data obtained from the first round of Delphi was analysed using SPSS software, in terms of central tendency and level of agreement among experts. 28 out of 34 items (82 %) achieved consensus in the first round. Only those items, which did not receive consensus in the first round were presented in the second round. C2 had the lowest score (mean value = 1.46) and strong agreement (IQR), experts unanimously believe that providing all single bedded patient rooms is not a feasible option in the Indian context, hence C2 was eliminated from the second round. Nine items were rephrased and presented in the second round, and the result was analyzed by SPSS software. The final list of design considerations has 33 items in 8 domains (Table 3). 5. Conclusions This paper investigated the therapeutic goals and design considerations related to pediatric healthcare settings by reviewing the existing literature and with the support from participating experts and design professionals using two rounds of the Delphi and presented a framework for easy and effective implementation of research evidence in design practice. The development of a framework for pediatric facilities is a critical step in healthcare research. This framework may be further expanded, validated for better integration in the design decision process. These design considerations will aid architects and facility planners in making design decisions for new or renovated pediatric healthcare facilities to improve the facility’s efficacy, performance, and aesthetics     Objective. Natural elements in the built healthcare environment have shown to hold potential stress-reducing properties. In order to shed light on the underlying mechanism of stress-reducing effects of nature, the present study investigates whether the stress-reducing effects of indoor plants occur because such an environment is perceived as being more attractive. Method. A single-factor between-subjects experimental design (nature: indoor plants vs. no plants) was used in which participants (n=77) were presented with a scenario describing hospitalization with a possible legionella diagnosis. The study was conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands. Subsequently, they were exposed to a photo of a hospital room. In this room were either indoor plants, or there was a painting of an urban environment on the wall. Afterwards, perceived stress and the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room were measured. Results. Participants exposed to the hospital room with indoor plants reported less stress than those in the control condition. Mediation analysis confirmed that indoor plants in a hospital room reduce feelings of stress through the perceived attractiveness of the room. Conclusion. This study confirms the stress-reducing properties of natural elements in the built healthcare environment. It also sheds light on the underlying mechanism causing this stress-reduction. Introduction Traditionally, healthcare facilities were built with the emphasis on the functional delivery of health care (Ulrich, 1995). However, since research supports the idea of the built healthcare environment having an impact the health and well-being of patients, more attention is being paid to the psychological consequences of architectural choices (Ulrich et al., 2004; Dijkstra et al., 2006). Such ‘psychologically supportive’ healthcare environments are also referred to as healing environments. This concept suggests that the physical environment of healthcare settings ‘can make a ⁎ Corresponding author.

Three dimensions of the physical healthcare environment that can have effects on health and well-being have been distinguished (Harris et al., 2002): architectural features (e.g., spatial layout, room size), ambient features (e.g., lighting, odors), and interior design features (e.g., color, artwork, indoor plants). Interior design variables provide relatively easy and inexpensive opportunities to alter the atmosphere of healthcare environments. This applies especially to facilities that have already been built, but may also be scheduled for renovation. The review from Dijkstra et al.

Being hospitalized is generally associated with feelings of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety (Mason et al., 1965; Pride, 1968). These feelings of stress and anxiety may affect the healing process. Research shows for example, that such psychological stress impairs wound healing in patients (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1995; Broadbent et al., 2003). With regard to the idea of healing environments, aspects of the built healthcare environment that can reduce this stress may therefore have beneficial effects on health-related outcomes. Natural elements Research on restorative environments suggests that certain environments are capable of promoting recovery from stress, and shows that especially natural settings have these restorative effects (Hartig et al., 1996). Considering the potential healing properties of nature (Ulrich 1984; Lohr and Pearson-Mims, 2000), exposing patients to natural elements may be an effective way of reducing stress associated with hospitalization. However, most healthcare facilities have been built in urban environments and thus lack natural resources that patients can be exposed to. Bringing nature into the hospital might be a good alternative to reduce stress in patients and in turn aid their recovery. Ulrich et al. (1991) studied the effects of exposure to nature on stress recovery. Participants watched a videotape that induced feelings of stress, and were afterwards exposed to a tape with either a natural or an urban environment. Results demonstrated that individuals recover sooner from stress when ex- posed to the former (natural) than the latter (urban). A trial by Diette et al. (2003) studied the effects of natural murals and sounds on patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy. It was found that pain control was better for patients exposed to nature. Lohr and Pearson-Mims (2000) studied whether the presence of indoor plants would increase pain tolerance. Participants were either placed in a room with plants, a room with non-plant objects (as visually distractive as the plants), or a control room (no objects). Results showed that a significantly larger proportion of respondents in the room with plants were able to keep their hand in the ice water for 5 minutes as compared to the other conditions, suggesting increased pain tolerance by exposure to indoor plants. They also showed that the room with plants was rated more positively (e.g., cheerful, calming, pleasant) than either of the control rooms. The results of these studies support the idea that indoor plants may have beneficial effects on the health and well-being of people. Natural elements in the built environment have clearly shown stress-reducing properties, but it is still unclear which underlying mechanism causes this stress-reduction. A potential explanation lies in the theories by Kaplan (1987) and Ulrich (1983), which state that people have a tendency to prefer natural settings to built environments. Although these two theories have some important differences (see Hartig et al. (1996) for a discussion), both are based on the same evolutionary assumptions. The preferences for natural settings are assumed to have an evolutionary base; people are to some extent biologically adapted to natural as opposed to built environments. Secondly, it might be argued that nature may be processed more easily and efficiently because the brain and sensory systems evolved in natural environments (Wohlwill, 1983). As a result, humans have an innate tendency to pay attention and respond positively to natural elements (Ulrich et al., 1991). This predisposition to prefer natural elements to man-made objects may be the explanation of the stress-reducing effects of nature. It might thus be hypothesized that natural elements affect feelings of stress through the perceived attractiveness of an environment. The purpose of this experiment was thus to investigate whether the stress-reducing effects of indoor plants occur because an environment with indoor plants is perceived as being more attractive. The following hypotheses will be tested: H1: The presence of indoor plants in a hospital room leads to reduced feelings of stress in patients. H2: The perceived attractiveness of the hospital room mediates this relation between plants and stress. Methods Design and procedure The experimentemployed a single-factor between-subjectsdesign(indoor plants vs. no plants) with participants being exposed to a scenario and a photo of a hospital room. This procedure has been shown to accurately simulate real environments Fig. 1. The photos of the hospital room (plants vs. no plants) used in the experiment conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands. (Stamps, 1990; Bateson and Hui, 1992). The meta-analysis by Stamps (1990) showed a 0.86 correlation between environmental preferences obtained by photographs and preferences obtained by exposure to real environments. The scenario described that participants had been hospitalized with symptoms of a legionella infection. They were asked to imagine having a headache, muscle pains and a fever several days after having gone swimming with some friends. Their primary care doctor referred them to the hospital for thorough testing and treatment. In both conditions, participants were exposed to a photo of the hospital room into which they were admitted. In the experimental condition indoor plants were placed in the room, whereas in the control condition there were no plants but there was a painting on the wall depicting an urban setting to generate a similar level of distraction (see Fig. 1). Participants A total of 77 students (35 male and 42 female) with a mean age of 21 years (SD=2.2) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control condition. The study was conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands. Participation was voluntary and a lottery with several cash prizes was used to attract volunteers. Measures Attractiveness To measure the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room, participants completed a 10-item bipolar adjective scale (c.f. Lohr and Pearson-Mims, 2000; Russell et al., 1981). Sample items include “pleasant–unpleasant”, “beautiful– ugly” and “friendly–unfriendly”. The average score on this 5-point scale was used as a measure of attractiveness (α=.92). Stress To measure perceived stress, participants responded to the 18-item stress dimension of the Stress Arousal Checklist (MacKay et al., 1978) on a 4-point scale (ranging from this word definitely describes my feelings [++] to this word doesn’t describe my feelings [−]). Sample items include “tense”, “up-tight”, and “worried”. The average score on this scale was used as a measure of stress (α=.94). Statistical procedures To test the first hypothesis that indoor plants in a hospital room effect to less stress, an independent samples t test was conducted. To test the second hypothesis that the perceived attractiveness of the room mediates this relation between plants and stress, a mediation analysis using multiple regressions was performed (Baron and Kenny, 1986). With a first regression analysis, the relation between plants and stress was tested. A second regression analysis was performed with the mediator (attractiveness) as the dependent variable and plants as the predictor. Subsequently, in line with the procedure outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986), it was tested whether the relationship between plants and stress was mediated by perceived attractiveness. Therefore, yet another regression analysis was performed with both plants and attractiveness as the predictors and stress as the criterion. In the case of mediation, the previously found relation between plants and stress should become insignificant, whereas the mediator should retain its significance. Further support was given by means of a Sobel test (Baron and Kenny, 1986; Preacher and Hayes, 2004). A probability of .05 was the criterion used for statistical significance. Results Stress An independent samples t test confirmed that participants in the hospital room with indoor plants perceived less stress (M=1.92, SD=.69) than participants in the hospital room with the painting (M=2.30, SD=.75; t(75)=2.34, P=.022). Mediation analysis The first regression analysis, with perceived stress as the dependent variable and the presence of indoor plants as the predictor, yielded a significant relation (β=−.39, P=.022) with participants perceiving less stress in the room with the indoor plants. A second regression analysis, with the mediator (attractiveness) as the dependent variable and the presence of plants as the predictor, showed that the presence of plants increased the perceived attractiveness significantly (β=.41,P=.017). Subsequently, it was tested whether the relation between the presence of plants and perceived stress was mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the room. Another regression analysis was performed with both the presence of plants and the perceived attractiveness of the room as predictors and perceived stress as the criterion. This analysis revealed that the previously found relation between the presence of plants and perceived stress became insignificant (β=−.23, P=.152), whereas the mediator retained its significance (β=−.38, P=.001), which indicates partial mediation (see Fig. 2). Further support for this mediating effect of attractiveness was found by means of a Sobel test, which confirmed that attractiveness mediates the relation between the presence of indoor plants and perceived stress (Z=−2.02, P=.042). Discussion The present experiment aimed to gain an understanding of the underlying mechanism of stress-reducing effects of natural elements in the built healthcare environment. Our results suggest that the presence of indoor plants in a hospital room leads to a reduction of perceived stress in patients. This finding supports the general notion that nature has stress-reducing proper- ties (Ulrich, 1983; Ulrich et al., 1991). Most importantly, the present results also demonstrate that these stress-reducing effects are mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room. The presence of indoor plants in a hospital room leads to a higher perceived attractiveness of the room and this, in turn, leads to reduced feelings of stress in patients. The positive effects of indoor plants on the perceived attractiveness of an environment (Lohr and Pearson-Mims, 2000; Larsen et al., 1998) as well as on the feelings of stress have been Fig. 2. Mediation model with attractiveness as mediator. Data from an experiment conducted from March to May 2007 in the Netherlands. 1significant at .05 level, nsnon-significant. established in previous research (Ulrich, 1984; Diette et al., 2003). The explanations of these effects of nature were mainly sought in evolutionary theory (Ulrich et al., 1991), which states that humans have a natural tendency to prefer natural elements to man-made objects (Kaplan, 1987). However, to our knowledge the mechanism by which exposure to nature may reduce feelingsof stress hadnever been empirically studied. This experiment showed that the stressreducing effects of nature are caused by the perceived attractiveness of the hospital room. This result would mean that, by basically making the environment more attractive, healing environments can contribute to the health and well-being of patients. Of course, there are numerous waysto improve the attractiveness of a hospital room, for example by changing the wall color. However, people vary in their preference of color (Grossman and Wisenblit, 1999), and it is therefore difficult to design a color scheme that is universally attractive. Since people generally prefer natural elements, the use of indoor plants in healthcare interiors thus seems a straightforward and effective way to promote the patients' recovery. Until now, most research on indoor plants in healthcare facilities has focused on health risks rather than on health benefits (LaCharity and McClure, 2003). Indoor plants are a potential source of bacteria through their soil and water and may cause hospital-acquired infections, although this has not been confirmed by research (Bartzokas et al., 1975; Siegman-Igra et al., 1986). Clearly, the introduction of indoor plants in hospitals needs to be closely monitored with respect to infection risks, and other side-effects such as, for example, limited working space for medical personnel. Nevertheless, the healing po- tential of indoor plants should not be overlooked. One might argue that the findings of a simulation experiment cannot be translated into actual healthcare settings. There is evidence available, though, that photographs can accurately simulate real environments and such studies show results similar to field experiments (Stamps, 1990; Bateson and Hui, 1992). Moreover, if exposure to an imaginary hospitalization and a photo of a hospital room with plants is already capable of generating such a clear effect, this may be very promising for actual exposure of hospitalized patients to indoor plants. Furthermore, even if these effects only appeared in moderation in real healthcare settings, such a simple and low-cost intervention may well be highly cost-effective. The current study employed a simple design by essentially testing the hypothesis that plants make a hospital room more attractive and that it is the attractiveness that reduces stress. In future research the evolutionary explanation given for the effects should be tested by including information processing or attention measures. It will also be interesting to know which other environmental stimuli are capable of affecting the perceived attrac- tiveness of an environment, as well as whether pictures of plants in a hospital room could generate similar results. This and the other hypotheses obviously demand replication in field experiments in healthcare settings with real patients. Conclusions All in all, this study confirms the stress-reducing properties of natural elements in the built healthcare environment. Moreover, it sheds light on the underlying mechanism causing this stressreduction. This experiment indicates that the stress-reducing ef- fects of nature interventions in the built healthcare environment are the result of a higher level of perceived attractiveness of such environments.     Mental health professionals have long speculated that the physical environment in which treatment occurs has an impact on both the treatment process and its outcome. The few empirical studies that evaluated the effects of psychoenvironmental design have shown encouraging results and demon- strated clinically desirable behavioral changes and even reduced psychopathology. In view of the concept that architecture is a tool in the therapeutic process, the design and execution of the psychiatric hospital in the Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel-Hashomer, Israel, were conducted by a multidisciplinary team of architects, mental health professionals, and administrators. The hospital contains three acute inpatient wards and a day care and large outpatient clinic. Its operation began in 1991. This paper deals with the merging of “user-friendly” architectural and environmental design components that create an integral healing environment. The paper discusses the positive effects of specific components on patients and staff, and suggests that our model of psychoenvironmental approach to psychiatric hospital design can provide an important and effective tool in the pursuit of a humane, efficient containment and reduction of severe psychopathology. © 1998 Elsevier Science Inc. Introduction We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us. (Sir Winston Churchill. TIME, Sept 12, 1960) Mental health professionals have long speculated that the physical environment in which treatment occurs has an impact on both the treatment process and its outcome [1–3], and they have paid increasing attention to the interrelationship between this Division of Psychiatry, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, and Sackler School of Medicine, Ramat-Aviv, (R.G., Y.S., J.Z.) and Zarhy Architects LTD, Tel Aviv, (M.Z.).

However, relatively little interest has been shown in the therapeutic potential of psychiatric architecture [6]. The few empirical studies that evaluated the effects of psychoenvironmental design have shown encouraging results. Higgs [4], for example, found a decrease in pathological behavior following a move of schizophrenic patients to a modernized unit. Gabb et al. [7] demonstrated the positive influence of the interior design of a public psychiatric facility on the creation of a supportive, stabilized environment for schizophrenic patients. Christenfeld et al. [8] showed selective behavior and attitude changes among both staff and patients after transition to a remodeled ward, as compared with matched control wards. Notably, one of the changes was a sig- nificant decrease in the rate of patient violence. Stahler et al. [9] found an increase in patient-staff interaction and a decrease in pathological behavior, together with improved morale among both patients and staff, after a remodeling of a psychiatric geriatric ward. Whitehead et al. [6] measured behavioral changes in a clinically desirable atmo- sphere subsequent to the redesigning of a psychiatric unit. These changes also correlated with reduced psychopathology, probably secondary to the betterment of staff-patient contact. Some authors [10] suggested that even minor architectural changes can lead to significant improvement in how the setting functions, with pos- itive effects for patients, staff, and families. Sommer and Ross [11] reported, in one of the earliest works on this issue, a doubling of the rate of social interactions among geriatric patients following the rear- rangement of furniture in a day room. Minde et al. [12] showed similar effects of restructuring a day room on psychosocial functioning, as well as on the stealing, and acting out in a psychiatric hospital for adolescents. Findings from the above-mentioned studies, as well as other publications, support the speculation that altered physical design variables, consistent with treatment philosophy, would be associated with favorable changes in staff and patient perception of ward atmosphere [1], and would have a therapeutic value [6]. Indeed, congruence between patient and staff perceptions of psychiatric wards has long been considered a necessary factor for Figure 2. Open porch of one of the wards. Note how the porch is continous with the lawn. Figure 3. Main entrance of the Psychiatric Hospital. quality of life, also in psychogeriatric patients. Corey et al. [1] proved that even simple redecoration of the psychiatric ward, such as changes in furniture style, floor covering, and color scheme, could have a favorable impact on staff members’ and patients’ perception of the psychosocial milieu. Another architectural change that reportedly might bring clinical benefits is structural division of the ward into smaller units. Wilson et al. [13] showed that structural division provided containment of incidents and reduction of vandalism, 100-item true/false questionnaire that is easily administered to patients and staff, and specifically assesses their perception of psychiatric inpatient treatment environment along three dimensions: relationship variables, treatment variables, and sys- tem maintenance variables [1]. Another measurement instrument is the Behavioral Environment Assessment Technique, which is derived from ethological studies and measures ward behavior. The procedure has proven effective in several studies of psychiatric patients [5,16] and Figure 4. The main hallway. Note the natural daylight coming from the ceiling. Figure 5. Another view of the main hallway. Note the patio on the left hand side. effective system functioning, although at least one study showed that those perceptions were higher for staff than for patients, and challenged the belief that such congruence is an indicator of program quality. In fact, the authors [14] believed that to expect congruence of perceptions may be unrealistic. To measure the psychosocial atmosphere of treatment environments, investigators often use the Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS), which was developed by Moos and Houts [15] in 1968. This is a in assessing change among them [17]. Thus, the positive effect of the so-called healing environment on psychiatric patients can be measured by valid tools and not recognized merely by global impression. An important finding in the study by Whitehead et al. [6] was that length of patient stay was not substantially affected by the ward redesign. This observation is meaningful because it is sometimes argued that providing a humane clinical setting will hamper staff efforts to discharge patients because of resistance to leaving the ward. Indeed, we may assume that in a healing environment the patients are more likely to improve clinically faster, and get discharged sooner. It is clear from this review that attention to the design of the physical environment of a psychiatric hospital can provide major support for patients and their treatment programs [18], as well as for the staff and families. Cooperation between architecture and psychiatry is therefore essential [10], and should be maintained during each phase of a project [19]. French psychiatrists Sivadon [20] and Amiel [21] simultaneously assumed the responsibility of relating to, and actively participating in, the design process of the healing environment. The results of their pioneering experiments, and their implementation, can be seen at La Verriere Hospital near Paris [22]. In view of the conception that architecture is a tool in the therapeutic process, the design and execution of the psychiatric hospital in The Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel-Hashomer, Israel, were conducted by a multidisciplinary team of architects, psychiatrists, and other mental health pro- fessionals and administrators, thus including the consumer as an active element in designing the facility [22]. The hospital contains three acute inpatient open wards, a day care clinic, and a big outpatient clinic. Its operation started in 1991. This has provided enough time to evaluate the influence of the design features on the patients’ well being and the recovery process. The Psychiatric Hospital is an integral part of the biggest medical center in Israel. Its location within the premises of a medical center allows ongoing interrelation and dialogue between the medical staff of the Division of Psychiatry and that of the other wards. The psychiatrists provide regular consultation-liaison services to the latter, and consult with physicians from other wards on nonpsy- chiatric medical issues. Patients suffering from both mental and physical disorders, which are often interacting and share reciprocal clinical impact, are benefiting daily from this arrangement. The location within a general medical center also facilitates the routine use of laboratory and brain imaging services, thus enhancing the level of medical care. In addition, it symbolizes the medicalization of psychiatry and alleviates the obvious apprehension of patients and their families regarding admission to a psychiatric institute. The daily clinical observation by the staff leaves no doubt that the patients enjoy their physical environment as it offers them a safe, comfortable, nonthreatening, and readily comprehensible set of surroundings. The messages sent by the physical environment convey sincere respect for the patient and sensitive concern for his or her physiological and psychological well-being, which are important contributors to the therapeutic process [23]. The design of the inpatient wards adheres to the basic set of guidelines for ward design: patients are not overcrowded or overconcentrated, so they are not forced to interact with too many people. They are given the opportunity to retreat physically when they feel threatened, and to form beneficial relationships [24]. The latter is achieved mainly by providing a variety of spaces that support social interaction [18], such as a big day room, a dining room that is well lit and ventilated [19], and spacious lobby and corridors, whose design resembles that of a living room with residential furniture rather than commonly used institutional pieces. The open porches of this one-story building are almost continuous with the lawn that surrounds them, thus providing further spaces for social interaction, and creating a free and unthreatening atmo- sphere while at the same time helping to define space. Generally, it seems that patients and staff react positively to the classical daylight and fresh air. The nurses’ stations are located in front of the day rooms, separated by big windows that are usually open. It is noteworthy to mention that an im- portant negative finding in the study performed by Whitehead et al. was the small number of patients who spent their time near the open nurses’ station [6]. Nurses often fear that patients will abuse their easier access if the nurses’ station is open. The data in this study prove this fear to be unrealistic. Moreover, it appears that the openness of design may encourage staff to leave the station and spend more time in the day room [6]. The building is well kept, with meticulous daily maintenance, and repairs are carried out promptly. This is essential, especially when vandalism or accidental damage occurs; constant maintenance dis- courages more destruction [19]. Safety in the psychiatric setting involves many aspects of facility design [25]. To mention a few, most of the patient living area can be easily observed by staff, lighting in the patients’ rooms is sufficient for adequate staff observation during evening and night hours, there are many exits which could be used in case of an emergency, and the building is equipped with smoke detectors and fire extinguishing equipment. As already mentioned, environmental conditions are important to the efficiency of the staff operation [22]. The staff’s working and resting areas are segregated and are provided with separate entrances, yet are easily accessible to patients and their relatives. Thus, boundaries are defined without sug- gesting alienation. It is unanimously agreed by all staff members that the physical environment in the psychiatric hospital contributes also to the quality of life and sense of professional dignity of the workers. The humane, efficient containment and reduction of severe psychopathology is a major goal shared by hospital designers, clinicians, and administrators [6]. Our model suggests that a psychoenviron- mental approach to psychiatric hospital design can provide an important and effective tool in that pursuit, and supports the prediction that a planned environment may favorably impact both patient and staff. The concept that “medical care cannot be separated from the buildings in which it is delivered,” and that “[T]he quality of space in such buildings affects the outcome of medical care” [26], is gaining increasing attention. This concept holds true especially in the case of psychiatric wards. Once in the domains of a general hospital, the psychiatric ward might suffer from the tendency of hospital architects and designers to focus on providing adequate space for new technology, and on maximizing functional efficiency [26]. It is the role of psychiatrists and other mental health workers to redirect the focus of ward design to the patients and their families, the consumers of hospital services. The psy- chiatric unit of the general hospital offers unique opportunities for the psychiatrist, nurse, administrator, architect, and designer to pool their talents for the benefit of patients with mental disorders [27]. As Sir Winston Churchill’s [28] aphorism implies, buildings are shaped by people for people. When well shaped, they can help ailing people get into better shape.      The spaces of the surgical operating theatre (ST) and associated built environment are analysed, to explore what the physical layout means for the interactions which take place. Three \"circuits of hygiene\" of surgical staff, surgical instruments, and patients are documented, and analysis of these physical movements through the surgical spaces examined for their contribution to sterility. It is concluded that the built environment of the ST contributes reminders to staff to fulfil the necessary procedures of aseptic technique, to ensure the safe passage of the patient through surgery into a condition where s/he may be designated as \"healed\".  INTRODUCTION The surgical operating theatre or operating room (henceforth ST) will be familiar to many people through popular media images. Surgeons seem will- ing to allow television crews into their theatres on the least pretext of some new breakthrough, while T.V. fictions set in hospitals routinely use the dra- matic setting of the ST with its unusual dress codes and physical organization. However, few operating theatres are now built to incorporate the viewing galleries which provided their U.K. name, and the opportunities for those not directly involved in sur- gical operations to witness precisely what occurs in these spaces has consequently diminished. The impact of the spaces of the built environment upon health and health care have been documented by many authors, and a number of approaches are discernible in these studies. 1. Studies of the impact of health care environment upon perceptions, experiences and well-being, including patients' recovery. For example, ward design has been analysed in terms of the creation of a \"healing\" (Biley, 1993) or \"therapeutic\" (Cotton and Geraty, 1984) environment, or in terms of staff preferences (Trites et al., 1970). 2. Interactionist studies which examine the impact of architecture on the engagements between people who inhabit the spaces. Rawlings found problems of communication between personnel working in a surgical sterilization unit due to physical boundaries in layout (Rawlings, 1989). The spatial allocation of patients in a casualty department was analysed in terms of doctor/ nurse interactions by Hughes (1988). 3. Structuralist approaches in anthropology and so- ciology examine how spaces and movements within spaces mirror or otherwise symbolically represent the activities which go on in them. Turner's (1968) study of the Ndembu people explored rites de passage associated with sickness which entailed complex movements, while Ardener (1972) considered the use of spatial iso- lation in the liengu rite used to heal seizures among the Cameroonian Bakweri. Rosengren and DeVault (1963) examined the spatial arrangements of obstetrics, and passing mention of the spaces of surgery is made in Hirschauer's (Hirschauer, 1991) analysis of surgical bodies. Studies within this tradition may distinguish between \"ritual\" and instrumental activities, and seek to disclose a \"deep structure\" beneath the surface manifestations of the interactions (Levi- Strauss, 1986). The approach adopted here might be best described as \"post-structuralist\", in that it eschews any notion that the built environment is determin- ing of behavior, or that there is a one-to-one con- gruity between architecture and the intended function of a space. Post-structuralism is interested in power and its relationship to knowledge, and the built environment may contribute to a \"knowledge\" of such things as how to behave, who may behave in certain ways and who is ascribed particular privi- lege. Such an approach emphasizes the \"reading\" of spaces by actors rather than the \"writing\" of behavioural imperatives within the physical structure of the built environment (Fox, 1993). Thus, in certain circumstances, architecture may make avail- able to actors a skein of signs with which they can support their discursive activities. For example, Prior writes that the design of health care spaces ,..can be best understood in relation to the discursive practices which are disclosed in their interiors. The architecture of the hospital is therefore inextricably bound up with the forms of medical theorizing and medical practice which were operant at the hour of their construction.... all sub- sequent modifications to hospital design can be seen as a product of alterations in medical discourse (Prior, 1988, p. 110). Spaces may thus offer cues to actors as to how they might engage with the environment and with others. On the other hand, they are not themselves \"discursive\", in that they may be read in ways other than those in which they had been \"written\". The built environment is adaptable, and in no way determines action or behaviour. To understand the significance of space in surgery we cannot depend upon analysis of the spaces themselves, but must look at the meanings ascribed to the spaces, and how the spaces are used to facilitate behaviours and routines. While not wishing to suggest any theoretical similarity between Goffman's approach and post-structuralism, the former's emphasis on the symbolic use of space in his (Goffman, 1959) notions of front (public) and back (private or exclusive) space seem particularly relevant to the study of the ST. Back spaces are those exclusively occupied by staff or \"insiders\" (doctors and nurses in a hospital, actors and stage crew in a theatre, priest and acolytes at a church service) and the normal rules of behaviour or decorum of an institution which invites the \"public\" into its front spaces may be absent or moderated in the back space. Back spaces are necessarily defined in opposition to front spaces, and are both exclusionary (of outsiders) and inclusionary in that they define \"insiders\" and facilitate different kinds of interactions to go on within them. Definitions of spaces as \"front\" and \"'back\" are contingent and mutable, usually at the discretion of the \"insiders\". The ST is one of the most inaccessible \"backspaces\" of the modern hospital, often sign- posted in code to further reduce the possibility of the casual unwelcome visitor. The fabrication of spaces which help to exclude outsiders may thus not only separate the ST physically from an other- wise relatively public space: the hospital, but permit interactions within the back space of the ST to be distinct from those which go on elsewhere in the building, freed from the intrusion of (conscious) patients and other outsiders. This paper draws on ethnographic material collected by the author in U.K. operating theatres and associated spaces (Fox, 1992), to examine the effect that the spaces of the ST may have upon inter- actions.* The first part of the paper is taken up with a description of some details of the physical spaces which constitute the ST, and this leads to an analysis of the impact of the built environment of the ST upon the sterile procedures of surgery. The analysis suggests how physical boundaries and barriers enable, and help to constitute, a regime of sterility which organize sets of movements through the surgical spaces: movements of bodies, staff and instruments. These circuits of hygiene (a phrase acknowledging the dictionary definition of \"hygiene\" as a \"system of rules for promoting health\") are \"sufficient\", yet not \"necessary\". Rules can be broken, and indeed variability in ST layout indicates that architecture is no more than an adjunct, a resource to bolster understandings of what should happen in the ST. The three circuits of hygiene of patients, staff and instruments supply a backdrop for the drama of surgery, the process by which a patient is subjected to a surgical intervention, be it the removal or repair of a tissue or body part. The significance of the circuits, and of the spaces through which they pass, need therefore to be considered in relation to surgical resection. The paper follows the movements of a patient through the surgical space during a \"typical\" operation, to elucidate the contribution of the circuits of hygiene, and of ST architecture to achieving sterile, safe surgery.  THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT OF THE OPERATING THEATRE The data reported in this study were collected principally at a large teaching hospital, here called General Hospital. At this hospital, surgery is car- ried out in 10 operating theatres, which are organized into five twin suites. There is diversity in layout even at this one hospital, and thus it may be expected that other facilities may further diverge; however there are some core features of the architecture which may be discerned from Fig. 1. At General Hospital, six theatres had congruent de- signs. Two others were congruent except that the scrub area was not divided from the operating area. The two plastic surgery theatres were designed around a central sterile corridor which separated anaesthetic room and ST.t The design of the ST is arranged around the central core area of the sterile corridor. The entrance to this corridor is clearly marked as off-limits to patients, visitors, and staff not authorized to enter, and form the principal barrier and boundary to the ST. Within this barrier a second set of doors marks the boundary beyond which sterile conditions are supposed to apply, and within which precautions are taken to reduce the numbers of infective organ- isms present• Because floors are disinfected, person- nel passing through the inner doors must first put on plastic overshoes which are available in a box between the two sets of doors. Observations of life within the ST suggest that the institution of the sterile corridor is the principal means of defining the surgical space as separate from the rest of the hospital. Nursing staff bringing patients to theatre use this route• However, most of the personnel based in the ST use a different means of access. Either between the two sets of doors, or via a discretely marked staff entrance, access is obtained to a staff corridor, which leads to changing rooms. Changing rooms contain washing and toilet facilities, and stocks of sterile clothing. Suitably garbed, personnel are able to enter the sterile corridor via an internal door from the changing rooms. These are the \"back spaces\" of this \"back space\". Each theatre within the twin suite possesses its own anaesthetic room and scrub areas, but shares instrument preparation and disposal facilities. These latter spaces are situated between the two theatres of a suite, and provide a means of access between theatres without passing through the sterile corridor. This area, consisting of theatres and instrument preparation areas, along with scrub areas, forms the inner sanctum within the ST, to which access is limited to specific personnel• The \"clean side\" instrument preparation area is accessible from the sterile corridor, and here sterile instruments from a Central Sterile Supplies Department (CSSD) in the hospital are unpacked and arranged on sterile trolleys which are subsequently wheeled into theatre via a corridor between the STs. Used instruments are returned to the \"dirty side\" via a hatchway towards the rear of each ST, to be replaced in the packs in which they arrived and returned in due course to the CSSD. Scrub areas contain washing facilities and stocks of sterile gowns, gloves and masks for use by surgeons and scrub nurses. The other areas comprise a recovery room for post-operative patients, and areas for use by staff: offices for doctors and the theatre sister, a rest room, and equipment stock rooms. The ST is thus virtually autonomous of the hospital, and in some STs where all-day lists are conducted, arrangements are made to provide snack luncheon for staff obviating the need to leave the ST between 9 a.m. and late afternoon. Telephones situated in the sterile corridor and in the offices, and the bleep system permit limited contact with the outside world to be maintained, although it can also effectively be kept at a distance by claiming pressure of urgent work to be done in the ST. Informants told the researcher that one of the pleasures of working in surgery was the inaccessibility. The effect which a sterile corridor has on separating the ST from the outside was noted by informants: Infection Control Nurse: Danger of infection will be used as the excuse for all the expense (of architectural arrangement), but these precautions are also very effective in keeping unwanted people out of theatre. Within the ST, the operating table is centrally placed. A movable anaesthetics trolley is situated to one end, and is connected to various pipes providing oxygen and anaesthetic gases. The orientation of the patient is therefore limited by the need for anaesthetic access, and the surgical and anaesthetic areas of the theatre are mutually exclusive. SPACE AND STERILITYIN THE ST Sterility is a key element in organizing activity within the ST area, and can be analysed as three concentric spaces of increasing hygiene. 1. The general environs of the ST, comprising the areas described earlier, and marked out as off- limits to any except those involved in one way or another in the activities of the ST. In this area, some efforts are made to adopt sterile procedures, for example, avoiding contact with sur- faces by street clothing or shoes. 2. The ST itself, which may be entered only by those garbed in surgical clothing comprising \"greens\" (linen shirt and trousers or skirt), clogs or boots, a cap or surgical hood, and in theory at least, a surgical mask. Clothing supplies are provided in the changing rooms which may be accessed through entrances to the ST complex avoiding the sterile corridor. These changing rooms are contiguous with the \"outside world\" and are thus \"liminal\" in status (Turner, 1968). 3. The \"sterile field\" surrounding the operating table and the patient. Anyone approaching this area should wear a surgical gown, sterile rubber gloves and a surgical mask. Furthermore, all personnel in this area must first have undergone the ritual of scrubbing the hands and forearms. The gloved hands must not touch anyone or anything which is not sterile, including mask or cap. Patients are considered to be non-sterile, and will be transformed into \"sterile objects\" by draping with towelling from neck to toe. Parts of a patient immediately adjacent to the site of the proposed incision area are washed with a disinfectant such as iodine, after which further sterilized towels are draped so as to leave a small rectangular area of skin exposed. A sterile adhesive plastic material may then be stuck to skin and surrounding towels, so that incisions are made through this membrane and underlying skin, enhancing the sterility of the area immediately adjacent to the wound. Towelling may be augmented by a non-porous paper barrier placed under conventional cloth towelling. The use of towelling or sterile plastic sheeting to create a barrier extends to drapes for any piece of equip- ment which is to be above an operation, such as an X-ray machine in orthopaedic surgery, or a microscope for plastic surgery. It is worth noting that while most sterile practices are intended to protect the patient from the surgical environment (including personnel), surgical garb may also be a protection for staff against contamination by patients with blood-borne diseases such as hepa- titis and HIV. Those who work in the spaces of the surgical enterprise must learn the rules of the ST, many of which concern the sterility of the theatre and surrounding areas. Asepsis is a technology for the exclusion of infective agents which might contaminate the sterile inside of the body during surgery, and the development of the built environment of the ST over the past 100 years reflects the developments in antisepsis and asepsis (Trites et al., 1970; Fox, 1988). It requires that all objects which come into contact with this sterile field (instruments, clothes and bodies) must be as far as possible germ- free, as should the air and other contents of the environment of the surgical operation. In practice of course, complete asepsis is impossible, and the procedures are nowadays usually complemented by pre-operative injections of antibiotics. The built environment of the ST is thus crucial for this aseptic technique in two ways. Firstly, it de- marcates the sterile area from the general septic environment of the hospital. Thus, within the precincts of the ST, sterile practices must be observed, and the meticulous rules of dress and behaviour are required of all who inhabit the spaces.* Secondly, the ST environment affects the movements of personnel, patients, and instruments which are \"permissible\" according to rules of steri- lity. These are partly built into the architecture of the ST; in this sense, the built environment is poten- tially a \"guarantor\" against inadvertent compromise of aseptic procedures. I call these rules of movement, the \"circuits of hygiene\".  THE CIRCUITS OF HYGIENE In this section I consider the movements of things and bodies in the ST in detail, and how these \"circuits of hygiene\" interact with the spaces of the built environment. While these movements may be understood as a set of technical rules for aseptic procedure, I would suggest that we can see in the circuits of hygiene something more: part of a \"covenant\" (Laufman, 1990) between staff and patients to operate safely. The circuits of hygiene are thus rhetorical markers which indicate that what is being done can be labelled as a form of healing. I would suggest that such markers are valu- able because surgery is a risky business, and often (and almost always in elective surgery) both the subjective experience of the patient and the clinical view is that strictly speaking a patient is \"more ill\" after the operation than before: suffering pain and discomfort from the wound, from the physiological after-effects of the anaesthetic, and perhaps emotional distress. In the extreme, the patient may die as a result of complications resulting from surgi- cal and/or anaesthetic intervention. Each circuit of hygiene represents an imperative by which the hygiene of surgery is maintained and promoted. The direction of movement ensures that successful hygiene ensues. \"Hygiene\" is used here in a double sense. In the narrower sense, hygiene con- sists of the science of sanitation, cleanliness and sterility. This may be designated hygieneI. However, the roots of the word \"hygiene\" are wider: accord- ing to a dictionary definition, \"hygiene\" was the knowledge and practice which concerned itself with the promotion and protection of health, deriving from Hygeia, goddess of health and daughter of Aesculapius in Greek mythology. This is hygiene2. This wider notion of hygiene as health is appropri- ate to the understanding of the procedures con- ducted in the ST, concerned as they are with the restoration and promotion of health in patients undergoing surgical healing. While the circuits of hygiene pertaining to staff and instruments act to ensure hygiene, they are also concerned with hygiene: the transition of the patient from her/his unhealthy status prior to healing to a more healthy status as healed. The patient's own circuit of hygiene, her/his movement through the surgical space to perform this status passage, is concerned foremost with hygiene.  In Fig. 1, arrows indicate the direction in which instruments, staff and patients usually move. There are no rules in the forms of signs or physical impedimenta to govern which directions are permissible, although of course barriers in the form of architectural construction limit possible movements. Yet there clearly appear to be conventions which lay down how staff, patients and instruments may move; it would be considered extremely unusual  (and probably dangerous) were a patient or an instrument to move in an unconventional direction. For example, while the scrub room may be used as a thoroughfare, it is conventional (partly to avoid disturbing patients awaiting anaesthetic induction) that the anaesthetic room is seen as the domain of anaesthetists and their assistant nurses, and is not used by other staff to access the ST, even when no patient is present. The arbitrariness of some con- ventions pertaining to staff are more obvious: the legitimacy of an activity may indeed depend upon where or by whom it is carried out. Field Notes: A trainee paramedic went for a coffee-break during an operation. He returned with cups of coffee for consultant anaesthetist Dr B and the researcher. Dr B (to the researcher): You had better take yours out- side. It is only consultants who are allowed to drink their coffee here. However, conventions can be altered: Surgeon Mr P: At G (a new private hospital), when com- missioned, a red line on the floor demarcated sterile areas in the ST. However, the inclusion of the coffee-room within this boundary prevented surgeons' colleagues drop- ping by for coffee, thus disrupting a convention of hospital sociability. The red line was quickly re-painted to exclude the coffee room from the sterile area. To separate the three circuits is somewhat artifi- cial, as it is their interaction and concurrence which contributes to the overall hygienic regime. The cir- cuits pertaining to staff and instruments will be described first, followed by a more lengthy descrip- tion of the \"patient circuit\" which necessarily involves staff and instruments. The staff circuit The division of labour within the ST means that different staff have differing \"circuits\", and the fol- lowing account recognizes some of these variations.   Personnel working in the ST (surgeons, anaesthe- tists, theatre and anaesthetic nurses, operating department assistants (ODAs), students and auxili- aries) enter the suite along the non-sterile staff cor ridor, the entrance to which is outside the inner doors to the sterile corridor (SC). From the staff corridor they can enter the men's and women's changing rooms, which are equipped with lavatory,  washing facilities and shower, and in which are supplies of sterile clothing, shoes, masks and caps.  Personnel discard their street clothes, although it seems acceptable to retain socks, underwear and tights. Theatre clothes can be quite revealing, and the whole procedure of changing seems to separate the ST from the outside, with its conventions of modesty. Surgeons who go on to the wards wearing theatre greens take care to fasten the side vent of their trousers which usually reveals bare flesh in the ST. Once changed, staff may enter the sterile area, which includes rest rooms, office, stores and tele- phone in addition to theatres and associated facilities. The kitchen is an ambiguous area in which sterile personnel prepare coffee, while access is also possible from the (non-sterile) staff corridor for auxiliaries who perform domestic duties. As noted earlier, the main access to the ST is via the scrub areas or the entrances by which patients are removed from theatre following their operation. Anaesthetists and their assistants tend to use the anaesthetic room as their means of entry and egress from the ST, except when accompanying a patient from the ST. Ward nurses and porters do not work in the ST area, and are seen as outsiders, although theatre staff are dependent upon them for providing the daily flow of patients. Porters bring patients into the sterile corridor through the main doors, and thence into the anesthetic room, accompanied by a nurse from the patient's ward. While the latter puts on overshoes before entering the sterile area, porters at General Hospital appeared to be exempt from this rule, possibly because unlike ward nurses, under very rare circumstances would they enter the theatre itself. Following completion of their duties, staff pass back through changing rooms into the non-sterile world, discarding used greens in laundry baskets in the changing rooms. The instrument circuit Instruments begin their circuit in the preparation room, where they are removed from the wire baskets in which they have been brought from the hos- pital CSSD. For a particular operation there is a designated complement of instruments which will be required, and it is the theatre sister's responsibility to ensure that the correct set are ordered in advance of the procedure. On occasions, delays result when sets of instruments have not been delivered in time for the designated procedure, patients are rescheduled or a surgeon changes a procedure (for example, from an investigation to an excision of tissue).   Instruments are brought from the instrument preparation room laid out on towel-covered trol- leys. These are positioned such that they can be accessed by the scrub nurse, often on gantries over the recumbent patient. Unscrubbed nurses will open packages containing sterile contents such as dispo- sable syringes, swabs and any prosthetic devices to be used. The outside of these packages are non-ster- ile, so they are designed so that the sterile contents will drop out on to the sterile surface, where they can be accessed by the scrub nurse. The scrub nurse passes sterile instruments to the surgeon, and no other personnel may come into contact with sterile instruments or towels, or sterile personnel. FieM Notes: During a procedure an extra pair of hands was required to retract the skin layer of a particularly obese patient during an operation, in order to gain satis- factory wound access. This task required considerable strength, so because of a shortage of nursing staff, I was asked to assist by holding the skin retractor. Because I was not scrubbed, I could not touch the retractor, and there was no time for me to scrub. So a piece of sterile bandage was tied to the eyelet of the retractor (which is shaped like a pair of scissors) and 1 was given the other end of this bandage to pull. A subtle means of breaching, yet technically sustaining, the sterile/non-sterile distinction was thereby devised. Some instruments will be used more than once during an operation, but any instruments which have lost their sterility, by contact with the skin, or with gastrointestinal contents, will be discarded. Discarded instruments are deposited in a dirty tray, while those not deemed to have lost their sterility may be laid to one side (for example, a scalpel used to cut the muscle layer, which is seen as sterile). Dirty instruments are dispatched to the \"dirty side\" via the hatchway, thus following a different route out of theatre from that by which the clean instru- ments entered.* This completes the instrument cir- cuit.contact with sterile instruments or towels, or sterile personnel.

Dirty instruments are dispatched to the \"dirty side\" via the hatchway, thus following a different route out of theatre from that by which the clean instruments entered.* This completes the instrument circuit.   The patient circuit In the following section I have documented aspects of a \"typical\" elective operation, collapsing many such operations observed during the period of fieldwork.  A patient due for surgery is brought from his/her ward to the ST by a porter, accompanied by a ward nurse. On the ward, the patient has been dressed in an operation gown, and transferred from his/her bed to a trolley for transport to the ST. For a very minor operation involving local anaesthesia, the patient may be brought to the ST in a wheelchair: this was only observed in the Plastic ST and the endoscopy clinic (a non-sterile theatre). Once within the boundaries of the ST, no patient may walk, they are always passive objects. The patient is wheeled into the anaesthetic room on the trolley. In most STs, this trolley, which brought the patient from the ward (and is therefore non-sterile), is used to move the patient into theatre via the anaesthetic room. However, in the ST designated for thoracic surgery, patients were transferred in the sterile corridor from the ward trolley to a sterile trolley kept in the ST area: this system of transfer is now more widespread. Once in the anaesthetic room, the ward nurse talks to the patient while anaesthetist and assistant prepare the anaesthetic. The patient may have received a pre-operat- ive sedative on the ward, consequently some patients have to be woken up in order to be sure the general anaesthetic puts them to sleep. The anaesthetist checks the case notes, which have been brought with the patient under her/his pillow. These will be the responsibility of the anaesthetist from now until the patient enters the recovery room, when they will be handed to recovery nursing staff. Based on patient weight, the dose of anaesthetic (often including an agent to achieve muscle paralysis) is calculated, and injected via a cannula inserted into a vein in back of the hand. As the anaesthetic is administered a veil of silence falls over all in the room. All focus their attention upon the eyes of the patient; as they close and the anaesthetist checks for unconsciousness, the tension evaporates. The blankets are whisked away, while the anaesthetist attaches a face mask to the patient, and connects a ventilator bag with which the patient's respiration is maintained manually until connected to an artificial ventilator in theatre; this bag is squeezed by the as- sistant or anaesthetic nurse to breath the patient. The ward nurse departs. The anaesthetized patient is wheeled through the closed doors at the far end of the anaesthetic room into theatre, and the patient transferred by the anaesthetist and assistant (or other handy person- nel) to the operating table. The anaesthetist now connects the patient to the artificial ventilator, and selects the anaesthetic to be used during the oper- ation, which come as canisters of volatile agent attached to the mobile trolley. The patient's contin- ued anaesthesia will thus be assured, and monitor- ing of the patient is now achieved by connection of electrocardiograph (ECG) leads to provide pulse, respiration and heart rhythm information via a monitor mounted above the anaesthetic trolley. The operation begins with the construction of a sterile field as described earlier, entailing towelling over all but the immediate site of incision. Surgery begins with the skin incision, which may be carried out by a junior member of the surgical team, who may also be invited to open the muscle layer in the case of ,bdominal surgery. Once the consultant or senior surgeon begins work, the focus of activity becomes the sterile field and the operative pro- cedure. Although other activities are taking place (continuity of anaesthesia and monitoring, checking fluid loss, ordering blood products, arranging sub- sequent operations), these must not impinge upon the focus. Unscrubbed personnel must guard against contact with the sterile field, and be ready to move non-sterile equipment such as the micro- scope, lighting and stools for the surgeon.  There is a timeless quality to these periods--little happens which can be described other than as the slow proceeding of the operation. The anaesthetist  continues to monitor the patient and from time to time may make a note or speak briefly with the sur- geon about the patient's condition. When surgery is minor there may be conversation, and often the boredom is alleviated by banter or general conversation on matters of professional interest. During major surgery there is little conversation except between the surgeon and assistant. When the procedure has been completed, and muscle and skin suturing begun, the surgeon informs the anaesthetist that the operation is over. The latter times the ending of anaesthetic procedures to coincide with the completion of wound closure and dressing: reversing the effects of muscle paralysis, ceasing the administration of anaesthetic gases and substituting 100% oxygen to awaken the patient. Dressings are supervised by the consultant surgeon but often applied by the assistant surgeon. Surgeons then depart, and used equipment is cleared away. Monitoring equipment is detached, and the patient is lifted on to the trolley, which has been brought back into theatre. A blanket is placed over the patient, and s/he is addressed by the anaesthetist, \"Wake up (name)..... it's all over\" and is asked to cough: s/he once again has an identity. The patient is made to say something, to assert his/ her agency, but most likely will then go back to sleep for a considerable time. The patient is wheeled out of theatre by the anaesthetist and assistant, via the side doors, into the recovery room, where nur- sing staff are continually present to observe the patient, The anaesthetist checks the patient's pulse and hands the notes written up during the operation with details of heart rate, respiration, and the drugs given, to the recovery nurse. The recovery space is still within the ST boundary, and seems to possess characteristics of a half- way house for those who work there. Nurse A: They (ward nurses) don't like you in recovery. You're in-between. Anaesthetie nurse: You're definitely in-between. While in recovery, the anaesthetist retains authority over the patient, and--often on the advice of the recovery nurse---decides when the patient can return to the ward, or occasionally, be moved to the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU). Thus a surgeon has authority only when the patient is on the operating table, and the anaesthetist is responsible for the induction and recovery periods. If recovery is without incident, the patient is eventually trans- ferred back to her/his ward by a porter and ward nurse. In this way, the patient circuit is completed. DISCUSSION In the previous sections, the movements performed by patients during surgery have been described in detail, placing surgery in the context of the processes by which a patient is conducted through the surgical places of the ST. The circuits of hygiene contribute to what Laufman (1990) has suggested is a \"covenant\" between staff and patient to provide appropriate asepsis and thus \"safe\" surgery. They \"guarantee\" that the patient arrives at the moment when surgery begins in a condition which is intended to ensure that the operation does not unintentionally increase the \"illness\" of the patient through infection. S/he is disinfected and sterile towels are draped. Instruments are sterilized, and the people who are to wield them undergo rou- tines to ensure that as far as possible they do not introduce infective agents into the wound. These procedures are time-consuming, yet they are recog- nized as essentials. Corners cannot be cut, and the routines are accepted by all involved as legitimate uses of staff time and resources. The circuits of hygiene thus bring together patient, instruments and surgical staff in one place, in conditions which minimize the risks that surgery brings to a patient. Not only do they achieve this, but they assure that they are seen to have been achieved. The circuits mark the efforts of all to make surgery a safe procedure, one which will not increase disease, a circumstance which would be hard to match with the idea of surgery as a form of healing. Because of the necessity for sterile preparations to be achieved without fault, the surgeon is dependent on the rest of the team to ensure that the patient comes to her/his knife in a \"hygienic\" state (in the broader sense of hygiene2, that is, in a \"healthy\" condition), Surgeons do not oversee the entire procedure, which from the early morning washing of the ST floors with disinfectant are aimed to achieve asepsis, or some approximation to it. They retire to their office, they let the theatre staff get the theatre to its state of readiness for surgery to occur. Then the surgeon is involved her/ himself, in scrubbing, and in overseeing the preparation of the patient. Even though the direct intervention by the surgeon is limited to the surgical intervention, s/he takes responsibility for the patient as soon as s/he arrives on the operating table. Responsibility is returned to the anaesthetist after the wound has been dressed, at which point the circuits of hygiene resume, with the moving of patient, dirty instruments etc. The circuits of hygiene are central to the team effort of surgery, and the spaces of the ST contribute to ensuring the team works effectively. The circuits routinize these efforts, they remove responsibility from the surgeon for overseeing the entire proceedings, and assure her/him that all has been done to enable healing to take place safely. Hygiene2, the requisite for surgery to be a form of healing, depends on routines of hygiene~carried out by theatre staff, over whom the surgeon has no direct control. Yet when the surgeon approaches the operating table, the rhetoric of the circuits of hygiene assures her/him that all has been done according to the rules of asepsis, and that s/he may operate with maximum certainty that her/his intervention will not endanger the patient by infection. Without this assurance, the intervention would be classed not as surgery, but as physical assault. For the status of the surgeon qua surgeon to continue, the circuits of hygiene must be successfully per- formed.* The built environment of the ST is thus not essential to surgery. One surgeon in the study commented that he could operate in the middle of a corn-field, and it would probably be a lot safer. But the architecture is a reminder to staff to adhere to sterile procedure. It can be \"read\", and contributes to the routines necessary for safe, sterile surgery. The spaces of the ST are thus a product not just of surgical technology or medical discourse (Prior, 1988), but of the continuing interactions of people and things which have developed in the procedures of modern surgery. And, while the contribution of the built environment may scarcely be apprehended by those who occupy and use them, these surgical spaces contribute substantively to the daily achievement of the tasks which take place within them, in this case, the enterprise of surgical healing. For those involved, it may contribute to their corresponding subjectivity as \"healers\".     Introduction Historically, noise, light and infection control have been the primary focus of health-care environmental design research. In the early 1980s, however, research on a cluster of physical dimensions was initiated which, instead of addressing the molliﬁcation of the negative aspects of the environment, switched the focus to the creation and reinforcement of positive experiences. These experiences were designed to allow one to project oneself into the environment outside the healthcare setting – typically a less hostile and more nurturing space. The focus of this new research had the common theme of providing positive distraction, or the ability to allow the individual to shift focus from negative foci within the health environment to the more restorative aspects of the non-medical world. Several environmental psychologists have addressed the role of positive distraction relative to human need and preference. Clare Cooper Marcus, Steven and Rachel Kaplan, Jay Appleton and Roger Ulrich have formulated theories regarding positive distraction in the context of their areas of specialization. For example, in Roger Ulrich’s Theory of Supportive Design,1 he cites three signiﬁcant factors which will help patients, family and staff cope with stress and, in turn, result in improved health outcomes: increased sense of control and access to privacy, social support and access to positive distractions. Environmental variables that are most commonly known to contribute to positive distraction are art, access to nature and music. The literature on these topics is discussed in the following article, followed by design guidelines that provide suggestions as to how to apply the principles to real environments. Literature review Art/color Although art has been incorporated in hospitals since the early 14th century, its purpose has changed. In lieu of preparing patients for death, or serving to increase donations, works of art now serve to address ‘a more holistic approach to medicine’.2 Acknowledgement of the role of art in healthcare settings has become mainstream and discussions of the implications of this environmental intervention take place in widely circulated medical journals.3 If art is to be used for positive distraction, the choice of genre (e.g., modern, primitive or representational) and topic is critical. Regarding genre, Ulrich4–6 noted that postoperative patients preferred representational pictures over abstract works. Part of this response might be associated with the topic portrayed in the images and part associated with color choice. Representational art tends to incorporate the subdued colors of the natural environment, whereas abstract art is often surprising in the color composition. Ireland, Warren and Herringer7 found that anxious individuals prefer less saturated colors, therefore, color may be a contributor to the impact on the viewer. Environmental Competence/Press Theory8 implies that individuals will seek less challenging environments as they become stressed. When one’s internal emotional stimulation increases, a stressed individual will seek a less stimulating external environment, in order to balance the overall experience. Zuckerman, Ulrich and McLaughlin9 noted that abstract work was more often preferred by high sensation seekers. This would suggest that more representational work would be preferred by individuals seeking a less stimulating environment. If individuals in healthcare settings are trying to reduce the intensity of the visual The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a stressful environment for both families and caregivers. Positive distraction is a means of mitigating stress. A review of research reveals that several factors in the physical environment can contribute to positive distraction, the most prominent of which are nature, art and music. Design interventions that provide positive distraction and can be introduced into the NICU setting are window views of pleasant outside vistas, soothing artwork and the ability to listen to music. Journal of Perinatology (2006) 26, S34–S37. doi:10.1038/sj.jp.7211584 Keywords: positive distraction; design guidelines; nature; art; music; NICU experience and achieve greater sensory control of their environment, they might prefer more representational work. Several abstract artists have argued that abstract art is not necessarily perceived negatively all by patients. Some research shows that previous exposure to art genre may inﬂuence preference, as young children do not prefer one type over the other.10 As such, providing patients and families choices regarding the art that is placed in their environment is an important consideration. Nature Kellert and Wilson, Steven and Rachel Kaplan and Roger Ulrich have engaged in intriguing discussions of the origin of our motivation to be associated with nature.11 The term ‘biophilia’ was coined by Dr Edward Wilson, an evolutionary biologist and refers to ‘the innately emotional afﬁliation of human beings to other living organisms’.12 Wilson suggests that, when the opportunity to associate with nature is limited (as is typical in health-care settings), the biophilic impulses are disrupted. Steven and Rachel Kaplan suggest that certain preferences for nature are pervasive human qualities, and are signiﬁcant because of their role in human evolution. Good interactions with and understanding of nature served to enhance human survival.13,14 Adjunct to the Kaplans’ theory is that preference is directly related to human perception and categorization behaviors which enable the individual to acquire more information. According to this hypothesis, nature views are most preferred when they provide information and simultaneously enable the viewer to be located at a safe (from predators) vantage point. Dr Ulrich cites access to nature as a primary means of distraction. Ulrich15 studied moderately stressed individuals, and found that more positive feelings resulted when these individuals were exposed to nature scenes than when they were exposed to urban scenes. Additionally, Ulrich1 found that exposure to videos of nature were more restorative than urban scenes, after viewing a stressful movie. Physiological measures included pulse, skin conductance, muscle tension and heart period. People appear to believe that access to nature may affect health outcomes. Olds16 conducted a study in which workshop participants were asked to draw images of spaces where a sick individual might go to be healed. Seventy-ﬁve percent of respondents drew scenes of the outdoors and included nature elements and vistas, light animals and beauty. The presence of windows is an extension of the concept of access to nature. Windows may impact a patient’s health outcomes and psychological condition.17 In Ulrich’s comparison of post-surgical cholecystectomy patients, he found that views of trees, as opposed to the brick wall of the adjacent building, resulted in better patient progress, less use of analgesics and shorter length of stay. In another study, patients who viewed nature pictures had less postoperative anxiety,18 and nature curtains with accompanying natures sounds, resulted in better bronchoscopy pain control.19 The impact of windows on the attentional fatigue of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses has also been studied.20 Although opposition to an increase in the number of windows may be a result of concern about increased construction costs, McKahan17 gathered data indicating that the average savings (when considering decreases in operational costs associated with improved health outcomes owing to views of nature) would be as high as $118 per patient day. Windows are more than openings in an exterior wall, and must be considered for their size and proportion. In a comparison of window and windowless hospital rooms, Verderber21 found that windows that are very small, distant or high, were not thought of as windows at all. Where windows may not be possible, access to natural light may have a positive impact. Residential sunlight was found to be associated with lower frequencies of breast and colon cancers.22 Lowered average length of stay and mortality was found in myocardial infarction patients who were located in sunny rooms.23 Regarding interior spaces that will accommodate interaction with nature, Burnett and Hamilton24 suggest providing a space for plants and a window seat. When the patient rooms are on the ground ﬂoor, a greenhouse space can be added adjacent to the room, which should be maintained from the exterior. Gardens are a primary opportunity to provide access to nature in a hospital setting. Medieval hospitals were often designed around courtyards25 and the ancient Greeks incorporated spas with water elements among their building types. The use of gardens in contemporary hospitals was less common until the 21st century. A set of post-occupancy evaluations of hospital gardens conducted by Cooper Marcus and Barnes26 found that, of the people who used the gardens, they normally visited the space at least once per day. The vast majority went there to relax and reported positive mood changes including spiritual experiences and stress reduction. Pet therapy (interaction between animals and patients in a healthcare setting) is a means of positive distraction and a form of access to nature. Although the opportunities for pet therapy in a neonatal ICU (NICU) setting may be limited, several studies have conﬁrmed the beneﬁts of this activity. Interaction with pets has been found to reduce perception of pain27 and improve perception of quality of life.28 Music Music may elicit a psychoneuro-immunological response, although this has not been conﬁrmed. Several studies suggest that music, especially when controllable, can reduce anxiety or stress and helps some patients cope with pain.29,30 Music has been employed to reduce stress or mitigate noise in several ICUs31–35 and Routhieaux and Tansik36 found that music reduced self-reported stress levels in ICU waiting rooms. With regard to infants, the studies on the impact of music and mother’s heartbeat are conﬂicting. The presence of music and subsequent withdrawal of music may actually have complex implications. Standley and Moore37 found that on the ﬁrst day of exposure to music, infants had signiﬁcantly higher oxygen saturation levels, but these effects diminished on subsequent days. Furthermore, babies exposed to music had signiﬁcantly depressed oxygen saturation levels after the music was terminated. There has been conﬂicting information as to which type of music (e.g., classical, jazz, pop and alternative) might be most appropriate for healthcare settings. Evidence from environmental psychology, however, would suggest that choice in selection is at least important as the genre. One of the common characteristics of patients and their families is a lack of sense of control. Choice of music may enhance a sense of control and help them to achieve a healthy state of mind. Minimally, music can be a distraction, and if the distraction deﬂects from focusing on the negative aspects of the healthcare environment, it should be considered. In the case of noisy intensive care environments, it can additionally serve to provide ‘white noise’ to mask disturbing NICU sounds. Design guidelines One of the shortcomings of design research is the lack of communication between researchers and those who create environments. As such, it is important to identify the physical implications of the research. Some of the guidelines in the following discussion are reported in the Recommended Standards provided elsewhere in this issue, others are the suggestions of this author. Art Regarding permanent art displays, it may be safer to provide realistic or ‘gentle’ abstract art. In situations where art displays can be changed, depending on the preference of the infant’s family or the NICU staff, options should be provided for multiple genres. The provision of an art cart from which patients select art to hang in their rooms is a tenet of the Planetree philosophy,38 a program that supports patient-centered care. Apart from genre, the subject matter is important. Generally it is recommended that works of art communicate a soothing experience or provide nature content. Lastly, it is important to remember that the art preferences of designers, who typically have extensive exposure to contemporary art, may be different from those of laypersons. Therefore, the population who will be experiencing the art should be consulted during the selection process. Nature There are three principle ways to provide access to nature. The ideal situation would be to provide NICU family members and staff with access to gardens, outdoor spaces and atria. Cooper Marcus and Barnes26 provide the following guidelines regarding hospital garden design: \u0001 interior and exterior environments should contrast with one another, \u0001 construction and plant materials should account for handicapped accessibility and the potential hypersensitivity to microclimate, \u0001 spaces should provided which are imbued with qualities of safety and security, to compensate for the distressed state of the users, \u0001 sensory stimulation should allow for an external focus, \u0001 the design should allow for both psychological and physical journeys, and \u0001 areas should allow for night group interaction and soliloquy. Minimally, all staff and families should have views outdoors through windows somewhere on the unit. In the case of families, they are best located in infant rooms and the waiting area. In the case of physicians and nurses, views should be provided from the lounge (where staff retreat for respite) and the nursing station (where staff spend extended periods of time). When that is not possible, natural light can be brought in through skylights, supplemented by art that includes nature images. Music As mentioned above, no speciﬁc genre of music is a prescription for healing, however, music which is enjoyed by an individual may serve as a positive distraction. The design recommendations are as follows: \u0001 provide access to music or white noise for patients and their families; it is critical that the potential listener have a choice in the presence or absence of music and, when it is available, be able to select a particular type of music; an option would be to provide equipment which would allow the patient or their family to bring their own music selection, \u0001 sound levels should not disturb other patients or their families, and it is recommended that head phones be provided, and \u0001 music can be provided in stafﬁng lounge settings, assuming it does not interfere with alarms or communication. The potential stress-reducing impacts of positive distraction are demonstrated by the research on this topic. It is likely that stressreduction may have a role in supporting the immune system. Minimally, positive distractions are desirable by NICU families and staff and will enhance satisfaction with the physical environment. Although art, nature and music are options for achieving these effects, other contributors are possible and should be explored. Proponents of positive distraction suggest that health-care environments cannot be fully enhanced if they are limited to mitigating the negative environmental dimensions. In addition to these important modiﬁcations, positive distractions should also be provided.     Objective To explore patients\u0002 perceptions of health-care built environments, to assess how they perceived health-care built facilities and designs. To develop a set of patient-centred indicators by which to appraise future health-care designs. Design Qualitative and quantitative methodologies, including futures group conferencing, autophotographic study, novice-expert exchanges and a questionnaire survey of a representative sample of past patients. Setting and participants The research was carried out at Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust (SRHT), Greater Manchester, UK, selected for the study because of planned comprehensive redevelopment based on the new NHS vision for hospital care and service delivery for the 21st century. Participants included 35 patients who took part in an autophotographic study, eight focus groups engaged in futures conferencing, a sample of past inpatients from the previous 12 months that returned 785 completed postal questionnaires. Results The futures group provided suggestions for radical improvements which were categorized into transport issues; accessibility and mobility; ground and landscape designs; social and public spaces; homeliness and assurance; cultural diversity; safety and security; personal space and access to outside. Patients\u0002 autophotographic study centred on: the quality of the ward design, human interactions, the state and quality of personal space, and facilities for recreation and leisure. The novices\u0002 suggestions were organized into categories of elemental factors representing patientfriendly designs. Experts from the architectural and surveying professions and staﬀat SRHT in turn considered these categories and respective subsets of factors. They agreed with the novices in terms of the headings but diﬀered in prioritizing the elemental factors. The questionnaire survey of past patients provided opinions about ward designs that varied according to where they stayed, single room, bay ward or long open ward. The main concerns were limitation of private space around the bed area, supportive of privacy and dignity, ward noise and other disturbances. Conclusions Patients perceived sustainable health-care environments to be supportive of their health and recovery. The design indicators developed from their perspectives and from their considerations for improvements to the health-care built environment were based on their visions of the role of the health-care facilities. These were homely environments that supported normal lifestyle and family functioning and designs that were supportive of accessibility and travel movements through transitional spaces. Introduction According to the new modernizing approaches to health put forward by the Department of Health,1 and the NHS Plan2 service provision and health-care built environments must develop a patient-centred strategy and focus upon the things that really matter to patients. This ﬁts well with notions of sustainability in its application to patient-centred hospital building designs and facilities provision. This is supported in the 2004 NHS improvement plan,3 which sets out the key commitments that the NHS will deliver to transform the patient’s experience. In terms of health-related aspects of the sustainable development paradigm, the built environment of health-care is crucial to the well-being of current and future patients and other stakeholders. Much of the literature on patients\u0002 perceptions of factors that aﬀect their health relates to standards of care.4–6 There is little research into patients\u0002 perceptions of hospital built environments speciﬁcally, the nature of the range of factors that they consider important to their health and well-being and how health-care built design appraisals can incorporate their considerations into the design brieﬁng and evaluation process. The research was carried out at Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust (SRHT), a large acute teaching hospital in Salford, Greater Manchester, UK. Planned comprehensive redevelopment of the hospital under the Salford Health Investment for Tomorrow (SHIFT) project involves substantial redevelopment of the main hospital site and the provision of four primary care and social centres at locations across the City of Salford designed for seamless delivery of health-care. This research was commissioned in light of these planned developments to ascertain patients\u0002 perceptions about the built environment of hospitals so as to inﬂuence the design process and the planning stages. Enhancing value by design appraisal Design appraisal relates to the process of examining a project, of whatever built form, against an agreed set of criteria that reﬂect a range of considerations, perspectives and interests. Its pur- pose is to identify critical area during the design stage, increase conﬁdence across the stages of development and operational services and thereby enhance the value of project, product or service to clients and users. Within the property development and construction industry it involves the assessment and evaluation of a project at the design stage for conformity against standards, technical speciﬁcations and codes. Thus, such appraisals address issues relating to quality, health and safety, regulatory compliance, environmental considerations and speciﬁed operational requirements of eﬃcient operational applications. Nevertheless, by looking beyond technical conformity and compliance indicators to consider the added value of community and personal perspectives of the stakeholders of interests, including the developer, client and end user, further value can be added and utility enhanced during the operational phase. The research carried out for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and the Department of the Environment and the Regions supported the view that good designs produce economic and social and environmental values.7 Researchers in landscape design and the architecture disciplines emphasize that people are sensitive and responsive to the environmental information that they receive from the built environment and provide useful insight into the need for planning responsive humane design.8–12 Research in the USA and the UK has begun to identify the contribution of patient environments to health and well-being and patients\u0002 recovery from illness; thus, well designed health-care environments can positively inﬂuence health outcomes.13–15 Lawson and Phiri’s study of architectural health-care environments compared the outcomes of patients referred and treated in new or refurbished hospital wards with that of similarly referred and treated patients in older hospital environments.16,17 The designs of the internal areas and transitional spaces within health-care facilities should be appraised to ensure that they satisfy the needs of patients and their families. Poor design has been linked to negative health eﬀects, including increased anxiety, greater need for analgesic medications, sleeplessness and higher rates of delirium.18–20 Var- ious design appraisal tool kits of procedures and step-by-step checks by which to carry out project design appraisal are available to the architectural profession and the construction and property development industry. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of UK evi- dence-based research that relates speciﬁcally to patients\u0002 views and design appraisal indicators that reﬂect their perceptions of the built healthcare environments. Aims and objectives The main aim of this research was to investigate how patients and their families perceived the built environments of NHS Trust hospitals. Its purpose was to explore their perceptions and their views about diﬀerent areas within a hospital and their requirements for quality improvements in the internal hospital areas and its external areas, including landscape and aesthetic considerations. The aim was to identify and evaluate their considerations for sustainable future designs as they envisaged them and from this to develop a set of patient-centred appraisal indicators to supplement existing tool kits used in the sector. Key objectives of the research were: • to develop an understanding of patients\u0002 experience within the hospital built environment; • to explore patients\u0002 considerations of sustainable design for built health-care environments; • to identify factors that inﬂuenced their experience within that environment; • to identify and evaluate the attributes that they considered contributed towards a sustainable patient-friendly environment; and • to develop a patient-centred indicator set for appraising built health-care designs. The built environments in the case study hospital The SRHT, an acute teaching Trust in Salford in the north-west of England provides local, regional and national services and has approximately 900 beds and employs 3500 staﬀ. It was established in 1994 after the relocation of Salford Royal Hospital onto the existing Hope Hospital site in 1993. This was followed by further expansion to include the nearby Ladywell Hospital onto the site in 1999. Thus, SRHT became a predominantly single-site Trust. The overall quality of the built environment of the hospital reﬂects its current infrastructure, which comprise a mixture of Victorian buildings, outmoded ward stock and piecemeal development of new blocks and facilities following the major relocations to the site. These factors inﬂuence patients\u0002, visitors\u0002 and stakeholders\u0002 perceptions, their experiences and their subsequent views and opinions of the built environments of the hospital and how it aﬀects them. The hospital was selected for the research because of the planned comprehensive redevelopment of the site under the SHIFT pro- ject. This came out of a visionary approach in the UK health-care sector based on the notion of a \u0003whole systems\u0002 model of care that puts the NHS Plan into practice in transforming local health and social care infrastructure. This involves a complete redesign of services to improve patients\u0002 experience and to deliver more accessible, eﬀective and responsive care. The investment project of approximately £200 million comprises separate aspects of physical redevelopment and a shift in service provision.21,22 The built environment aspect of the project should thereby reﬂect a patientcentred focus in its design and function to meet the sustainability objectives of the health service plan. Methodology The research method was based on separate strands of qualitative and quantitative research designs. The qualitative strand used four interpretative methodological approaches. The ﬁrst comprised 50 one-to-one personal interviews, reported in a separate paper.21 The second involved an autophotographic study in which a sample of 35 patients were asked to take photographs of situations that represented their own interpretations and impressions of what they found good or bad about the hospital environment. The methodology was based on frame- works used previously in social science research.23–25 One digital camera was used and it was passed from one patient to the next as required. Several patients who were conﬁned to bed took photographs from their beds. Most were able to walk around their wards and some walked further away, along the corridors, into day and utility rooms and sometimes around the wider hospital site. The third approach used a \u0003novice-expert\u0002 cohort technique. This approach, based on an adapted qualitative Delphi approach,26 facilitated engagement between selected groups of \u0003novices\u0002 and \u0003experts\u0002 about their respective views and their rankings of nominated elemental attributes necessary for patient-friendly environments. Novices were people, who may have been a patient in a hospital or may have visited a family member, friend or colleague but who did not work in or have direct links with a hospital. Forty novices were asked to nominate the initial elemental attributes that they considered necessary for a patient’s friendly hospital environment. Experts were professionals with expertise in areas of the health-care built environment. They were randomly selected from a sample drawn from the membership lists of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and from staﬀat SRHT. The fourth of the qualitative method themes involved a series of futures conferences in which rapid appraisal workshops were held with focus groups that were both linked to, and independent of, the hospital. The groups that were linked with SRHT comprised patients\u0002 support and voluntary workers who met periodically at the hospital to discuss present and future healthcare concerns with the hospital’s executives. The independent group had no direct link with SRHT and comprised groups of local residents drawn from across the City of Salford. Five conference groups were undertaken with the linked groups at SRHT and three with the independent group. The quantitative strand of the research comprised a postal questionnaire survey to 2200 past patients of SRHT. A stratiﬁed sample was drawn from a sample frame of patients who had been discharged during the ﬁrst week of each calendar month from December 2000 to August 2001 inclusive. Approximately 500 patients were discharged each week but because of the exclusion criteria set by the hospital and the Ethics Committee patients that were seriously ill, those with certain speciﬁed illnesses, treatments or situations, and those going onto hospices were excluded from the sample. The survey was carried out over two mailshots, which together generated 785 completed useable returns giving a response rate of 37%. Results Perspectives from the qualitative themes Autophotographic study The photographs that were taken show that there was much similarity in the issues and factors that patients captured on camera across the four departments. Patients took pictures that centred mostly on the quality of ward design (36.5%), types of human–environment interactions (23%), the state and quality of their personal space (17.4%) and facilities for recreation and leisure (15.8%). The views reported in ensuing discussions with researchers were that the environment of the internal areas of the hospital aﬀected their feelings of well-being. Their likes of the environment, items, situations and activities as represented by the photographs reﬂected the factors and inﬂuences that made them feel comfortable and able to keep a sense of normality (Table 1). The photographs that represented their dislikes were reﬂections of the things that they found annoying and in many cases those which compromised their privacy (Table 2). Novice-experts The novices provided an extensive range of suggestions, which were analysed using an itemized theme analysis approach similar to that of the thematic framework suggested by Miles and Huberman.27 The common elements were extracted into 25 categories, all with their principal elemental factors. Experts from the archi- tectural and surveying professions and staﬀat SRHT considered these elemental factors, which were in turn discussed by both novices and focus groups. The principal factors that emerged from these prioritizing interactions were: good signage and way ﬁnding; controllable lighting for a natural and homely environment; privacy for patients\u0002 dignity, conﬁdence and assurance; reduced noise levels in internal and external areas; temperature control for personal comfort and relaxation; access to the natural environment, including views of nature; safety and security in internal and external areas; internal and external children’s play areas; accommodation for visitors and relatives; shops and personal services; good around the clock catering facilities; and good landscape designs with seating and garden areas. The futures conference groups At each of the eight focus group meetings, in order to encourage free and open discussions, a representative set of photographs taken by the researchers to show the hospital’s internal and external areas were shown in a presentation and were also mounted around the room in which group discussions took place. Each group reported speciﬁc diﬃculties with way ﬁnding, diﬃculties experienced with long corridors which did not oﬀer places to rest or access to outside, inappropriate ward designs giving Table 1 Photographs representing patients \u0003likes\u0002 Areas/activities photographed Reasons given for selecting and taking particular photographs The bay Liked the layout and the company Space around their bed Gave privacy, accessibility to get around and space for families and visitors TV Had something to do, was occupied Shower Modern, private and spacious Windows Being able to see outside The cafe Gave a feeling of normality and somewhere to go with families and visitors The shopping mall Gave a feeling of normality and somewhere to go with families and visitors Nursing staff Cheerful staff members were an important part of the environment Table 2 Photographs representing patients\u0002 \u0003dislikes\u0002 Areas/activities photographed Reasons given for selecting and taking particular photographs Long corridors with lots of obstacles Difﬁcult to ﬁnd way and to get outside Long, open wards Too little privacy The bay Busy and noisy at night Window with high sills Can only see sky, need a view of outside Day room Cold empty spaces Lockers Insufﬁcient space to keep belongings Curtains Drab, poor design, do not allow privacy Washrooms Too cramped and poorly kept insuﬃcient personal space, poor views of the natural environment from the bed and unsympathetic lighting and decor. The linked hospital groups discussed the patients\u0002 journey, considered experiences of such journeys, and considered futuristic scenarios for improved health-care built environments across other NHS hospitals. Perspectives from the quantitative theme Of the postal survey returns, 31% of respondents had been in hospital between 1 and 3 days, 19% stayed 4–5 days, 35% stayed between 6 and 14 days and 15% more than 2 weeks. In terms of the type of ward in which they stayed during their hospitalization periods, 36.9% stayed in a two to four bed bay, 28.8% stayed in a long, open ward, 21.8% stayed in small bay wards that were clustered around a nurses\u0002 station and 12.5% had a single room. Nearly half the patients (48%) were admitted to the hospital for surgery; the next largest group (39.1%) were referred for medical care. Only a small number had been admitted to the maternity and elderly care wards (0.5% and 2.7% respectively), and 9.4% declined to record reasons for admission. The results of the quantitative strand of the research complemented the qualitative theme. The respondents\u0002 views about the hospital were positive and they were generally satisﬁed with the facilities provided. Opinions about whether the design of their rooms/bays was patientfriendly varied according to the type of ward in which they stayed. Patients in single rooms and those who stayed in small bays clustered around a nurses\u0002 station reported being most satisﬁed with their environment. Nearly one-third of those respondents who had stayed in a two to four bed bay and a long, open ward were fairly satisﬁed as opposed to completely or very satisﬁed (Table 3). Negative responses were chieﬂy in relation to the room/bay at night. Respondents frequently reported annoyance with the level of noise and disturbances during the night.

One in 10 of those who had stayed in a single room were dissatisﬁed with this during the night. By far the largest issue mentioned by respondents who felt that the environment was not patient-friendly was space, and particularly the lack of space between patients\u0002 beds. Limited space aﬀected the amount of privacy that they enjoyed and it was also seen as an issue in accommodating their visitors. Additional comments were made about the poor facilities for visitors, which included the lack of suﬃcient seating and the inability to get light refreshments on the ward. In addition, respondents viewed their inability to control the temperature around their bed as a restriction. While the general pattern emerging from the questionnaire responses was for respondents to be positive about the facilities on their ward, two issues in particular received strong negative ratings: restricted views of outside from the bed and bedside entertainment (Table 4). In contrast, patients\u0002 washroom facilities were gener- ally rated very good. The trend overall was for Table 4 Views on the ward facilities the facilities to be rated as good or satisfactory rather than very good. One respondent suggested that using more substantial dividing curtains or repositioning the beds could overcome the issue of lack of privacy. A similar point was also made that the beds could be divided in a corresponding way to that used in open-plan oﬃce complexes. There was general agreement that the lack of activities for patients (such as a TV at the end of the bed) tended to mean that patients were more conscious of what was going on around them and that this reduced the amount of privacy patients had. TVs and headphones oﬀered a distraction. There was consensus that patients should have their own bedside TV and entertainment communication system, which was preferred to one central TV. One area for improvement related to the views outside the ward. Respondents reported that having views helped them to \u0003relate\u0002 to the outside world. One respondent suggested that hav- ing a particular view outside the window could greatly aﬀect one’s mood. Being able to see, and preferably go outside was seen as very important. A further request was for the provision of more windows within ward designs, not only in terms of the views but also for ventilation.

The majority of respondents (50.3%) had walked onto the ward, while 29.2% had been taken onto the ward on a trolley and 20.5% had used a wheelchair. Related responses are presented in Table 5. Rating of other facilities Respondents identiﬁed a number of facilities that catered for patients and their families across the hospital, for example, the children’s play area, the shopping areas and the restaurant and cafe’s. Respondents were asked for their views on each of these facilities (Table 6). The shopping area received the most praise. The second most popular facility was the cafe/restaurant. In contrast, most of the other facilities were generally rated as being at best satisfactory. Discussion Perception of hospital built environment The above ﬁndings point to the importance of a common set of patients\u0002 perceptions of the hospital built environments.

Patients reported that knowing where they were at any given point during their visit to the hospital was very important. Many reported that they had experienced confusion and diﬃculties with orientation around the hospital on their ﬁrst visit during the arrival and then the admittance phase of their hospital experience. This ﬁnding supports studies that have reported on individuals\u0002 biological needs related to orientation, visual perception and deﬁnition of territory.11,21,28,29 Patients\u0002 perceptions of the environment once they had been admitted to the ward were inﬂuenced by factors that aﬀected their normal life- style functioning, such as their ability to eat and sleep; feelings of security or insecurity and the situation arising out of the amount of privacy and dignity that the design of the ward allowed them. Further factors suggested related to their ability to control the environment and loss of empowerment in simple day-to-day actions such as switching lights on and oﬀas required by changing conditions, adjusting the central heating, making a cup of tea, looking out through the window and entertaining a visitor. These ﬁndings support the results of previous studies that stressed the importance of the healing environment in patients\u0002 experience and recovery.9,14,17 Patients and the groups involved in the research expressed the importance of being able to have a sense of independence. This, for example, can be facilitated by good design to enable them to have enough space to move around the ward area, to allow them privacy with both medical staﬀand their family and visitors. They also wanted to be able to view everyday activities from all internal areas when it was impossible to go outside. This hindrance was captured in the photographs of inadequate building design in which long corridors without external access and with poorly positioned lifts and stairs often made views and access to outside diﬃcult. Supportive staff and service facilities Patients placed importance upon the contribution made by supportive staﬀand other patients to the experience of the hospital environment. This was reﬂected, for example, in the number of photographs that patients took of the nursing staﬀto represent what they found to be good about their environment. In some instances, patients reported that they found it diﬃcult to photograph what they disliked – for example, the noise in the bay at night, which stopped them from sleeping, and the lack of facilities such as having TVs near their bedside and space, chairs and basic catering provision that were unavailable for their visitors comforts. These ﬁndings support previous studies, which have reported how functional environments that have patient-focused, or supportive characteristics assist patients in dealing with the stress of illness and aid their recovery.20,30,31 Patients expressed their desire to be supported and to be able to have a sense of control of their actions through the provision of well-designed facilities which support social interaction and feelings of normality. In identifying the preferences of stakeholders regarding the type of facilities they wanted the hospital and the wider NHS to provide, the study found that respondents identiﬁed the notion of a supportive environment and a basic need for a sense of space encompassing private and public territories. To be supportive, physical space and social space needed to be ﬂexible and negotiable. The key element was that the individual should have ownership and control over their space and others should not be able to invade it without prior agreement. Social space was considered to encompass communal areas either within bays or between wards. It encompassed the provision of areas where patients could eat, drink and interact with others to maintain a sense of normality. The evidence suggests that this need was not met by day rooms, which were poorly used and perceived as sparse, insular and \u0003empty places\u0002. Patient-centred appraisal of built health-care designs The patients\u0002 views, considerations and their suggestions from each of the various areas of the research provided a large number of itemized criteria for design evaluation. Each indicator element was developed from the ﬁndings by extracting the principal considerations from the range of views expressed from each area of the qualitative and quantitative themes of the research. In this way, qualitative factor and content analysis allowed these considerations to be broken down into 23 internal categories and 12 external categories. Thus each category, presented as separate indicator elements in Tables 7 and 8, was itself compiled from detailed subsets, each of which provided greater detail to reﬂect the range of considerations put forward by patients. For example, as shown in Table 7, the entrances and reception areas indicator set comprised 18 elements. The patients\u0002 privacy and dignity subset comprised nine elements, catering 11 elements and accessibility eight. Tables 7 and 8 present the separate internal and external environment design appraisal indicator sets. They comprise individual elements by Table 7 Principal internal indicators of patient-friendly environments Patients health status Patient’s age and gender sympathies Gender Age Patients\u0002 health sympathies Patients\u0002 socio-cultural sympathies Genetics/ physical abilities Emotional distress and anxiety Social and family circumstances Cultural considerations Indicator elements to examine from patients perspective Way ﬁnding – internal signage Rooms: consulting, diagnostics Rooms: treatment, utility Lighting, levels, ambience and control Noise levels and acoustics Temperature control and ventilation Access to and from transitional spaces Entrances, reception, social spaces Ward environment Surfaces and ﬂoors Views and natural outlook Washrooms/hygiene facilities Personal space and ownership Privacy and dignity Nurses\u0002 station/staff contact Spiritual and pastoral care areas Safety and security Homely facilities Accommodation for relatives Catering facilities Leisure and recreational facilities Shops and personal services Telephone, television and Internet Total score Guidelines for scoring the design elements for patient’s friendly environments.

Gender Age Total score which designs can be appraised from the patients perspectives so as to give due considerations to their particular characteristics. The evaluation method suggested in the tables develops from the health impact assessment carried out on the SHIFT project and elsewhere, which emphasized the importance of the role of existing health status.22,32,33 Thus, each indicator can be used to appraise a proposed design so as to give due consideration to the patients health status represented in Tables 7 and 8 by the column head- ings, age and gender sympathies, health sympathies, including patients biological, genetics/physical abilities and emotional states also socio-cultural sympathies such as social and family circumstances and cultural considerations. The patient health status can be extended in carrying out an appraisal by including further biological factors, family circumstances and lifestyle factors including impairments, compromised hearing, vision and bodily functions, and patient characteristics, whether neonates, children, adolescents, adults or elderly. In appraising health-care designs on the basis of these indicators, a score of between 1 and 4 should be awarded on the basis of contributory potential to patient health status and sympathies. The project commissioners, design team and patients from representative clinical pathways should discuss and agree upon the speciﬁc indicator elements and health status categories to apply during the design planning and development brieﬁng stages. As an appraisal tool, the indicators allow ﬂexibility in its application allowing selected elements and health status categories to be applied with respect to patient requirements for speciﬁc healthcare projects. A good patient focussed design should score over 90% of the aggregate score for the agreed indicator elements and health status categories. Conclusion This paper explored patients\u0002 perceptions and their attitudes to hospital environments and to the factors that contributed to their experience. Patients were found to have full understandings of the range of factors that aﬀected them, especially bearing in mind their existing health status, independent of the speciﬁc health condition that led to their hospitalization. Patients across the four departments of the case study hospital provided an extensive range of health inﬂuencing considerations. Principal indicator sets were extracted to form internal and external indicator sets, each with individual element by which to evaluate a design. Such an approach provides for an increased focus around the interest of the patient and allows their normal health status to be taken into account during the design process and planning stages. By this the design of hospitals\u0002 internal and external areas, including transitional spaces for access and patients ﬂows, should provide for sustainable supportive environments, which minimize anxiety and promote healing through the creation of an overall inviting, calming and engaging eﬀect. Health-care environments exist within the broader context of human-centred demand from organizational and physical development. Patients require environments that support homely normal lifestyle and family functioning. They require designs that are supportive of privacy and dignity, ownership of territory, accessibility needs and travel movements through transitional and public spaces. In light of the visions stated in the NHS Plan, these are timely considerations and provide an opportunity for health-care decision-makers to apply and incorporate patient-centred considerations into all built environment designs for current and future health-care programmes.      INTRODUCTION Sustainability is, as the name implies, a movement to ensure long-term, efﬁcient utilization of resources. Sustainability does not imply that resources should be restricted nor that resource utilization should be subsidized. Bill  McDonough (McDonough and Braungart 2002) has described sustainability in terms of the three E’s: environment,  equity, and economy. In the last quarter century the lighting industry has dramatically improved the energy efﬁ  ciency  (environment “E”) and life-cycle cost of lighting (economy “E”). Much less attention has been given to the equity “E.”  Lighting standards are still set primarily in terms of illuminances (lumens per square meter) and lumens per watt,  both of which are based upon the implicit assumption that the value of lighting can be characterized by the lumen.  The lumen is, however, unrelated to other non-visual effects of light, such as the circadian system, and is only indirectly related to our perceptual system. In particular, our current architectural practices do not adequately support the  most fragile segments of the population. And no matter how much energy is conserved or how much value engineering is applied, we are not designing or implementing sustainable lighting because we are not supporting many of the  people in our built environments. In fact, the role of lighting as it affects human perceptual and circadian functions  is almost completely ignored in standards. Arguably, the failure to consider these two human domain functions can  be ignored in many modern applications because of the inherent ﬂexibility and robustness of the human species. One  segment of construction where the equity “E” should always be more seriously considered, however, is healthcare applications. These applications contain our most fragile humans, and lighting has been shown, for example, to demonstrably affect the lives of seniors and premature infants. But there are no standards to assist architects and engineers in  supporting the well-being of these fragile people. To illustrate this assertion, this article focuses on sustainable lighting  for healthcare applications where good lighting in all three human domains, visual, perceptual, and circadian, can be  best documented. BACKGROUND Bill McDonough (McDonough and Braungart  2002) has described sustainability in terms of the  three E’s: environment, equity, and economy (Figure 1). The environment “E” is most often associ- ated with the sustainability movement in lighting.  Nearly every discussion of sustainable lighting is  concerned, often only concerned, with energy efﬁciency. Certainly energy efﬁciency is essential for  sustainability. But it is equally important that sustainable lighting is cost effective and it should serve  the needs of building occupants.  Sustainability should support human endeavors,  not waste our natural resources, and should be profitable. For “cradle to cradle” sustainability all three  E’s must be addressed. In the last quarter century  the lighting industry has dramatically improved  the energy efﬁciency and life-cycle cost of lighting.  Much less attention has been given to the equity “E”  of the sustainability triangle illustrated in Figure 1.  Lighting standards are still set primarily in terms of  illuminances (lumens per square meter) and lumens  per watt, both of which are based upon the implicit  assumption that the value of lighting can be characterized by the lumen. However, the lumen is derived  from a very narrow set of experimental conditions  that are only relevant to simple visual functions, but  does not characterize all of the visual responses important to modern built environments (e.g., apparent  brightness). Moreover, the lumen is only indirectly  related to providing perceptual information about  the environment (e.g., linear perspective) and it is,  by deﬁnition, unrelated to the non-visual, circadian  effects of lighting that help maintain entrainment of  our many biological functions to local time. Boyce  and Rea (2001) have conceptualized three domains  that light can affect people. These are illustrated in  Figure 2. Again, the lumen is relevant to only one of  these three domains, which is the visual system. LIGHT ISN’T JUST FOR VISION ANYMORE Light is formally defined as optical radiation between 380 and 780 nm that provides visual sensation in humans (CIE 1978). The human eye has  photoreceptors that convert radiant energy into neural signals for processing by the brain, a phenomenon called phototransduction. Until recently, four  types of photoreceptors had been identified: rods  and short, middle, and long wavelength cones (Rea  2000). Rods allow us to see at night and cones allow  us to see during the day, discriminate details, and see  colors. The neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of  the human visual system is largely understood and  all lighting technologies, standards, measurement  devices and applications have been based solely on  that understanding (Rea 2000). Given very recent  developments in science, however, it is important to  embrace the fact that light is not just for vision anymore. In the past few decades much work has been  done to understand the non-visual effects of light on  human health and well-being (Rea et al. 2002).  Light entering the human eye is transmitted to  several other parts in the brain than those projecting to the visual centers. In 2002, the intrinsically  photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGCs), a  novel photoreceptor type in the retina, was discovered (Berson et al. 2002). The ipRGCs are central  to an important “non-visual” response to light by  the retina, most notably the regulation of circadian  rhythms. The world rotates around its axis and, as  a result, all creatures exposed to daylight on earth  experience 24-hour cycles of light and dark. Biological rhythms are self-sustaining oscillations with a  set of species-speciﬁc characteristics, including amplitude, phase, and period (Moore-Ede et al. 1982).  Living organisms have adapted to this daily rotation  of the earth by developing biological rhythms that  repeat at approximately 24 hours. These are called  circadian rhythms (Latin: circa, about; dies, day).  FIGURE 2. Human performance,  health, and well-being is inﬂuenced by  at least three systems: visual, circadian,  and perceptual. Circadian rhythms are generated endogenously  (internal to the body) and are constantly aligned  with the environment by zeitgebers (time givers),  factors exogenous or external to the body. In mammals, circadian rhythms are regulated by an internal  biological clock (pacemaker) located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus of  the brain (Moore-Ede et al. 1982). The SCN is a  self-sustaining oscillator that maintains its daily activities for weeks when isolated and cultured. The  SCN in humans has a natural period that is slightly  greater than 24 hours and environmental cues can  reset and synchronize the SCN daily, ensuring that  the organism’s behavioral and physiological rhythms  are in synchrony with the daily rhythms in its environment. The light/dark cycle is the main synchronizer of the SCN to the solar day (Klein et al. 1991)  and reaches the SCN via the retinohypothalamic  tract (RHT). Although the circadian system shares  receptors and neurons in the retina with the visual  system, the retinal ganglion cells exiting the eye for  the visual centers are different than those exiting the  eye for the circadian system. Light as well as dark  play an important role in regulating our circadian  rhythms, and the timing of light/dark cycles are  profoundly important for many of our behaviors as  well as our well-being. Light can have both an acute and a phase-shifting effect on the internal clock. Acute effects are  seen shortly after light exposure. For example, it  takes about ﬁve to ten minutes for light to suppress  the production of nocturnal melatonin, a hormone  produced at night and under condition of darkness  (McIntyre et al. 1989). Acute effects also disappear  soon after a light stimulus is removed; after about  30 to 45 minutes in the dark, nocturnal melatonin  returns to a normal level. Phase shifting effects are  seen a few hours or days after light exposure. Light  applied during the early part of the night will delay  the clock (for example, bed and waking times will  occur later than in the previous cycle) and light applied very late at night or in the early morning will  advance the clock (bed and waking times will occur  earlier than in the previous cycle). If light is applied  before minimum core body temperature, it will  delay the clock while light applied after minimum  core body temperature will advance the clock. Minimum core body temperature typically occurs about  1½ to 2 hours before one wakes up naturally (i.e.,  without an alarm clock) (Jewett et al. 1997).  In addition to impacting our circadian system,  light reveals the many intersecting spatial planes that  make up the environment (Paulus et al. 1984). Architectural features can be used to provide information about the environment and therefore improve  navigation in the space (Gibson 1966). Light reveals  visual information by providing a spatial reference  for self-position and location of obstacles within a  person’s surroundings. For example, removal of  visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to  result in increased body sway (Paulus et al. 1984;  Turano et al. 1994). Therefore, lighting schemes  that reveal or enhance architectural features should  be used to aid navigation and orientation in the built  environment. LIGHTING CHARACTERISTICS  AFFECTING THE VISUAL AND  CIRCADIAN SYSTEMS Light can be decomposed in ﬁ  ve characteristic dimensions: quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing,  and duration (Rea et al. 2002). These light characteristics affect the circadian system very differently  than they affect the visual and perceptual systems.  In brief, more light is needed to impact the circadian  system than to stimulate the visual system. Young  people can read a book under moonlight but no  studies to date have been able to demonstrate that  moonlight suppresses nocturnal melatonin production or shifts circadian phase. For reading, the daytime (photopic) visual response is maximally sensitive to light at 555 nm (yellow-green light), while  the circadian system is a “blue-sky detector,” maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 450 nm. The visual system has a very fast response time. The visual  system can fully process light pulses as short as 80  milliseconds. The circadian system is very slow to  respond requiring several minutes to fully integrate  light falling on the retina. Thus the circadian system seems to be completely blind to brief but very  bright lightning ﬂashes at night. Perhaps the largest  difference between the visual and circadian systems  is associated with the time that light is registered  on the retina. The visual system responds nearly  the same any time of the day or night. However, as  already mentioned, the internal clock can be reset  forward (phase advance) or backward (phase delay)  depending on the timing of light exposure. Finally,  it should be added that the sensitivity of the circadian system to light appears to change depending  on previous light exposures. For example, an ofﬁce worker who stayed in a dim room all day long will  suppress more melatonin when exposed to a given  light at night than would a farmer, who had experienced very high outdoor light levels during the day.  The circadian system seems to be more concerned  with contrasting (night versus day) than absolute  light levels (Herbert et al. 2002).  HOW LIGHT IMPACTS OUR HEALTH  AND WELL-BEING The effects of light on the circadian system are not  trivial and should always be taken into consideration  when designing lighting in a space. Upsetting the  daily pattern of circadian light and dark affects performance and well-being, as well as, it seems, our  basic health. The therapeutic value of circadian light  (and dark) on fringe populations has been demonstrated in laboratory and ﬁ  eld studies. Light with the appropriate characteristics can reduce symptoms  of seasonal affective disorder (Levitt et al. 2002),  increase sleep efficiency of older adults including  those with Alzheimer’s disease (van Someren et al.  1997; Figueiro et al. 2002; Figueiro and Rea 2005),  improve circadian entrainment of premature infants  (Rivkees et al. 2004), and increase alertness and  well-being of night-shift workers (Badia et al. 1991,  Cajochen et al. 2000, Figueiro et al. 2001, Cajochen  et al. 2005, Figueiro et al. 2007). It has even been  suggested that some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease may be linked to the disruption of the  normal circadian light/dark pattern. The impact  of light on the general population is less clear. It is  hypothesized that some disorders, including cancer  and heart disease, may be a result of lack of entrainment, or synchronization, between the timing of  one’s internal clock and the day/night pattern, much  like jet-lag after travel across multiple time zones. EQUITY FOR OLDER ADULTS  IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES  AND NURSING HOMES After age 40, changes to the aging eye become more  noticeable as visual capabilities decrease. The inability to focus on objects at close distances is noticed  in particular after age 45; this is called presbyopia.  As one grows older, less light reaches the back of the  eyes because the pupil gets smaller and the crystalline lens inside the eye becomes thicker, absorbing  more light. A 60-year-old receives about 1/3 of as  much light at the retina as a 20-year-old. The lens  also begins to scatter more light as one ages, adding a “luminous veil” over images on the retina,  which reduces the distinctness (or contrast) of objects and the vividness of colors. After age 60 to 65  years, chances of having age-related eye diseases are  greater. Common age-related problems are cataract,  macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and  glaucoma. Cataracts are dark, cloudy, or opaque  areas in parts or all of the crystalline lens. Macular  degeneration refers to neural damage to central vision. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when blood vessels  feeding the retina are damaged and regions of visual  ﬁeld are lost. Glaucoma is a result of too much ﬂuid pressure inside the eye, which cuts off blood ﬂow  and, thus, nutrition to the retina and ultimately the  optic nerve. As one ages, changes to the circadian system are  also more noticeable and may lead to sleep disturbances. Surveys indicate that 40 to 70 percent of  the oldest members of the population (over 65 years  old) suffer from chronic sleep disturbances (Van Someren 2000). In general, older adults tend to go to  bed earlier in the evening and wake earlier in the  morning than younger adults. Frequent nocturnal  awakenings, difficulty falling asleep, and an increased number of naps during the day are also more  common in the oldest adults. Sleep disturbances are  associated with decreased physical health, including  increased cardiovascular problems, disruption of endocrine functions, and decline of immune functions  (Van Cauter et al. 1998). Many physiological changes are implicated in the  circadian rhythm disturbances found in older adults.  Studies have shown that the SCN may become  less responsive as we age. Studies have also demonstrated that changes in the amplitude and timing of  melatonin and core body temperature rhythms may  occur in older adults. Also, the ﬁrst stage of phototransduction (when light signals are converted into  neural signals) is negatively affected; older adults  not only have reduced optical transmission at short  wavelengths, which is maximally effective for the circadian system, but they also lead a more sedentary  indoor lifestyle, with less access to bright light during the day. In fact, research has demonstrated that  middle-aged adults are exposed to approximately 58  minutes of light above 1000 lux at the eye per day  (Espiratu et al. 1994), while older adults in assisted  living facilities were exposed to light above 1000 lux  at the eye for only 35 minutes a day (Sanchez et al.  1993). Moreover, adults in nursing homes see as little  as 2 minutes of light a day above 2000 lux at the eye  (Ancoli-Israel et al. 1989).  Previous research demonstrated that light can  be used as a non-pharmacological tool to help older  adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease  (AD), sleep more efﬁciently. Light in the evening can  delay the circadian clock and help older adults sleep  better at night and be more awake during the day  (Murphy and Campbell 1996). Other studies have  shown that exposure to bright white light improved  sleep efﬁciency of institutionalized older adults (Satlin et al. 1992; Okawa et al. 1993; Mishima et al.  1994; Fetveit et al. 2003). One study demonstrated  that evening exposure to 30 lx at the eye of blue light  from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) peaking at 470  nm for two hours consolidated rest/activity rhythms  and increased sleep efﬁciency of older adults with  sleep complaints (Figueiro and Rea 2005). Exposure  to bright light (at least 2500 lx and as high as 8000  lx) for at least one hour in the morning for a period of  at least two weeks consolidated sleep of AD patients.  Greater sleep efﬁciency at night decreased sleep during daytime hours and, in some cases, reduced agitation behavior (Ancoli-Israel et al. 2000; Koyama et  al. 1999; Lyketsos et al. 1999; Mishima et al. 1998;  Lovell et al. 1995; Mishima et al. 1994). Unattended  exposure to bright white light (1136 lux average at  the eye) during the entire day improved rest-activity  of AD patients (van Someren et al. 1997). Evening  exposure to bright white light (1500 to 2000 lx) for  two hours decreased nocturnal activity and severity  of evening agitation (sundowning) of AD patients  (Satlin et al. 1992). Finally, evening exposure to 30  lx at the eye of blue light from LEDs peaking at 470  nm for two hours consolidated rest/activity rhythms  and increased sleep efﬁciency of persons with AD  (Figueiro et al. 2002 and Figueiro and Rea 2005).  More recently, Sloane et al. showed that exposure to  high intensity light all day or during morning hours  only increased nighttime sleep in subjects with severe and very severe dementia. They also showed  that morning light produced a mean phase advance  of 29 minutes; that is, subjects went to bed earlier  than prior to the lighting intervention.  The visual system also plays an important role in  postural control and stability. More importantly, visual information is integrated with input from the  vestibular and somatosensory systems, which are  linked to balance control. Any changes that occur to  any of these systems will affect the other systems’ capabilities of maintaining balance (Lord et al. 1991).  In fact, studies have demonstrated that removal of  visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to  result in increased body sway. Recently, Figueiro  and colleagues showed that nightlights that provide  horizontal and vertical perceptual cues are well accepted by caregivers and, more importantly, can  help increase postural stability when older adults  are transitioning from sitting to a standing position  (Figueiro et al. 2007).  USING LIGHTING TO PROMOTE EQUITY  IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND  NURSING HOMES Although not everything is known about the effects  of light on health and well-being, it seems reasonable with the information available today to provide  a 24-hour lighting scheme that maintains circadian  entrainment as much as possible while promoting  good visibility during waking hours and safe navigation at night. Following this logic, lighting in assisted living facilities and nursing homes should provide: high circadian light stimulation during the day  and low circadian stimulation at night; good visual  performance (e.g., reading) during waking hours;  and low-level nightlights that enable safe movement  through the space and minimize sleep disruption.  Guidelines for lighting for the aging  circadian system Proposed is a dual lighting scheme that maximizes  circadian stimulation during the day and minimizes  it at night, while maintaining good visibility at any  time (Figueiro 2008, in press). The evidence suggests that high circadian stimulation during daytime  waking hours can probably be achieved by about  400 lx at the cornea of a 6500 K (cool-white) light  source. During evening waking hours, the lighting  system should provide no more than 100 lx at the  cornea from a white light with low energy in the  short-wavelength region of the spectrum. Relatively  dim ambient evening light can be provided by light  sources such as a 2700 K (warm-white) compact ﬂ  uorescent lamp (CFL). The dual lighting system pro- vides older people with a day/night circadian light  ratio of about 16:1.  High circadian stimulation during the day and  low circadian stimulation during the evening can be  achieved using a combination of daylight and electric light sources. Daylight can certainly be an effective light source for regulating the circadian system.  Outdoor lighting has the ideal quantity, spectrum,  distribution, timing, and duration, but it should not  be assumed that daylight in buildings will always  provide people with a suitable circadian light pattern. Again, a quantitative analysis of daylight in the  space should be carefully made because the amount  of daylight varies considerably throughout a building. Daylight levels in a room drop very quickly  as the distance from the window increases; daylight levels are quite low three to four meters away  from a window, even on a sunny day (Bullough et  al. 1996). It should also be noted that if sunlight  from the window penetrates the room, discomfort  glare may cause occupants to draw blinds or shades,  eliminating daylight entirely from the space. Since  it cannot be assumed that daylight in buildings is  always going to be a solution for circadian entrainment, electric light must always be considered. In order to select the most efﬁcacious light source  for the circadian system, an assessment of the relative circadian effectiveness of different spectral  power distributions (SPDs) emitted by common  electric light sources was performed using the model  of human circadian phototransduction developed by  Rea and colleagues (Rea et al. 2005). This model  considers the fact that the circadian system is maximally sensitive to blue light, so light sources that  have more short wavelength content (i.e., look more  bluish-white) are more effective in activating the circadian system for the same amount of used watts.  Table 1 shows the photopic lumens per watt (lm/W)  and circadian stimulus per watt (CS/W) for a selection of commercially available light sources.  The relatively dim evening lighting scheme is  entirely consistent with current lighting recommendations and practice and, although the light levels  recommended for daytime applications are relatively  high compared to current practice, they are not difﬁcult to achieve with contemporary, high-efﬁcacy,  ﬂuorescent lighting systems, particularly if controls  are incorporated into the design. The designer should  also consider using the dual lighting scheme in common areas where residents are more likely to spend  their waking hours. This may vary with the application. For example, in a single room assisted living  setting, the dual lighting scheme needs to be implemented in the room and in a common area, such as  the dining room. In nursing homes, the dual lighting scheme can be implemented in day rooms and  dining rooms. If power density requirements are still  an issue, however, local supplementary lights from  blue LEDs can be integrated into the design. Based  on the author’s previous experience, compliance by  older adults to a light treatment given by a supplementary lighting system is not trivial. However, in  cases where compliance is not an issue, such as when  the treatment is applied to healthy older adults living at home or in assisted living, ambient light levels  can be reduced to 80–100 lux at the cornea (which is  about 300 lux on the horizontal surfaces) of a neutral  light source (3000 K–4100 K lamp) and the use of  TABLE 1. Photopic lumens/watt (lm/W) and circadian  stimulus/watt (CS/W) for some electric light sources.  Values of CS/watt were arbitrarily normalized to a black  body radiator of 2856 K at 100 lux at the eye. In this  way, values for both lm/W and CS/W become equal for  a common incandescent light source. Adapted from  Figueiro (in press).

Table 1 provides quantitative guidance on the amount of light  needed to match the circadian effectiveness of many  light sources, including blue LEDs. Guidelines for lighting for the aging  visual system Of course, good visual conditions cannot be ignored  in any application, but it is important particularly  when designing lighting for older adults. The light  levels recommended for the circadian system should  be sufﬁcient for older adults to perform daily visual  tasks. In spaces where the high circadian stimulation  cannot be used, ambient light levels for the aging  visual system should be 300 lux on the horizontal  surfaces (80–100 lux at the cornea) of a neutral light  source (i.e., 3000 K–4100 K lamp). More localized  light will be needed to perform tasks that require  seeing fine details (e.g., sewing, reading prescription bottle labels, chopping vegetables). Architects  and speciﬁers should still provide lighting that gives  high, glare-free illumination on the task with no direct or reﬂected view of the light source, soft shadows  throughout the space, balanced illuminance levels,  and light sources that provide good color rendering.  Some other lighting principles for the aging visual  system that can help architects, speciﬁers, builders,  facility managers, and homeowners (Figueiro, 2001)  light interior spaces include:  • More light on task areas—use concentrated light  to increase illuminance levels on the task. As  much as 10 times more light will be required to  see ﬁne details (e.g., reading small points) or lowcontrast objects (e.g., black thread on blue cloth)  than is required to see most architectural structures (e.g., doors, cabinets, furniture). Increase  light level in areas where visual tasks are performed by placing adjustable light ﬁxtures close  to the task, or by selecting lamps with more lumens (look for lumen rating on the package, not  wattage; be careful not to exceed the lamp ﬁxture  wattage). Fluorescent lamps are usually a good  option because they provide more lumens per  watt than incandescent lamps, and they last 10  times longer than common incandescent lamps;  they are available with excellent color, plenty of  light, no buzz or ﬂicker; they are cooler to touch,  and they can be dimmed. Increase ambient light  levels by keeping surface ﬁnishes light in color.  Light-colored walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings will help  minimize shadows and increase overall light levFIGURE 3A AND 3B. Illuminance levels should be high on working areas such as kitchen counter, sink, and stove. The  light source itself should always be hidden from direct view. (Photograph by Michael Kalla.) els in the living environment. Place light ﬁxtures  where visibility is important, such as below the  kitchen countertop, over the kitchen sink, in the  shower, and in closet and laundry spaces. • Less glare—Although more light is required  for the older eye to see, care should be taken  to avoid glare. Glare is experienced when light  sources or bright reﬂections in the ﬁeld of view  impair vision, or are uncomfortable. Very bright  lights should not be placed against dark ceilings.  The light source itself should be hidden with a  shade, bafﬂes, non-shiny louvers, or a shielding  board. If a bare lamp is unavoidable (e.g., fan  lights), it should be frosted to diffuse the light.  In this same vein, clear glass light ﬁxtures should  also be avoided. The use of shiny ﬂoor ﬁnishes  and polished surfaces should also be minimized  to reduce reﬂection from light sources.  • Balanced light levels—Due to optical and perhaps neural changes to the eye, older adults  cannot adapt to dim lighting conditions as well  as younger people. As a result, illuminance  levels in transitional spaces, such as hallways  and entrance foyers, should be similar to those  of the adjacent spaces. The ambient light levels  in adjacent spaces should be balanced to be  approximately the same. Multiple switches or  dimmers to create intermediate light levels in  transitional spaces that lead from bright, outdoor  areas, to dim, indoor spaces should be chosen.  Transitional spaces should be dimmer at night  and brighter during the day. • Enhanced colors—Color discrimination is poorer  for older adults because of scattered light in the  eye. The aged lens also absorbs relatively more  short wavelength (blue) light, so it is particularly  difﬁcult to discriminate between, for example,  dark purple and maroon. Use lamps with high  lumens and good color rendering properties. A  more extensive discussion on color properties of  the light source is below.  • Improved contrast—Because contrast sensitivity  is reduced with age, the visibility of important  objects, such as stair edges, curbs, ramps, or  doorways, can be greatly improved by increasing  their contrast with paint or similar techniques.  FIGURE 4. Shielding boards or lenses should be used to hide a direct view of the light source. (Photograph by Michael  Kalla.) Contrasting colors to mark edges, such as doorframes, baseboards, or steps should be used. Designing a lighting installation that meets the  needs of the aging eye involves selecting the proper  light source, lighting ﬁ  xture, and lighting control,  as well as determining the best location for the  equipment in the room. The following tips help  in the selection and proper installation of lighting  equipment: • For general illumination, use compact ﬂ  uorescent lamps with approximately 1/3 the wattage  of a common incandescent lamp to produce the  same amount of light.  • To highlight certain areas (e.g., above kitchen  sink) or objects (e.g., pictures on the wall), use a  halogen parabolic aluminized reﬂector (PAR) incandescent lamp to concentrate the illumination.  • Avoid clear glass light ﬁxtures and light bulbs;  these create glare. • Select a semi-secular or matte ﬁ  nish to prevent  glare from the reﬂ  ection of the light bulb for  light ﬁxtures with a visible reﬂector. • Select a deep-recessed downright (cutoff angle  between 40( and 50( from horizontal) so the  light source is hidden from normal sight lines. • Avoid placing recessed or ceiling mounted luminaires on dark ceilings; they may appear too  bright and cause glare. • Place light ﬁxtures located above ﬁxed working  areas slightly to the side and in front of the position where a person would stand to see the task. • Use wet location-rated light ﬁxtures in shower/ bath areas. (Figure 5). • Select a matte countertop vanity with light colors that reﬂect light to the underside of the  chin. To avoid harsh facial shadows, avoid using  recessed downlights to light the bathroom vanity  countertop (Figure 5).  Guidelines for lighting for the aging  perceptual system Just as important, nightlights that both reduce the  risk of falls and help to maintain sleep should be  used. Proposed nightlights with motion-sensor control are shown in Figure 6. The nightlights should  FIGURE 5. For better visibility, a light ﬁxture should be placed in the shower or bath area. Recessed downlights to  light the vanity countertop should never be used; lighting from the sides of the mirror is much better for grooming.  (Photograph by Michael Kalla.) provide dim illumination to the local environment  (1 to 5 lux at the cornea), but they also provide enhanced spatial perceptual information about the  surroundings. Nightlights accent the rectilinear architectural features in the room, highlighting essential vertical and horizontal information people need  to promote postural stability while navigating in an  otherwise dim environment. Since the nightlights  are only on when motion is detected, they do not require the occupant to grope blindly for a light switch  that, when found, would then activate a bright, ambient lighting system. They are on only when a person needs to move through the space at night. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Table 2 summarizes lighting principles for older  adults that should meet the needs of their visual,  circadian, and perceptual systems. Two lighting  FIGURE 6. Nightlights with motion sensor control  provide dim illumination to the local environment as well  as enhanced spatial perceptual information by providing  horizontal and vertical cues, but only when needed by  the occupant. schemes are proposed, and the more appropriate  solution will depend on the needs of the occupant.  Although lighting scheme 1 will have higher initial  and operating costs, it is the recommended solution  for older adults who cannot easily or are unwilling  to change their behavior. The architect and speciﬁer should keep in mind that to save expense lighting  scheme 1 can be installed in just a few highly used  spaces rather than throughout the entire facility.  Lighting scheme 2 should be used when compliance  by older people is unlikely to occur and where ceiling renovations cannot be practically implemented.  EQUITY FOR CAREGIVERS  IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES Healthcare facilities operate 24 hours a day, seven  days a week, and, therefore, the design criteria must  also take into account the needs of health care professionals, both day and night. The lighting principles for the visual system discussed above are also  applicable for dayshift and nightshift workers, but  their needs are not as acute. Lighting that is designed  for the aging eye is good lighting for any age group!  When it comes to circadian lighting, dayshift workers are more likely to have the opportunity to receive  sufﬁcient circadian light during their waking hours  than more sedentary older adults. Nevertheless, this  is not always the case so it is important that dayshift  workers receive high circadian light stimulation  during the day and low circadian light stimulation  during evening hours at home to maintain circadian entrainment. Sufﬁcient daylight from windows  and skylights during working hours combined with  daylight exposure outside the workplace can provide  sufﬁcient circadian light stimulation. Low circadian  light during the evening and night is equally important. By strategically adopting changes in light spectrum and level at work and at home, good circadian  light stimulation as well as good visual conditions  can be created throughout the day and night. Designing for the well-being of nightshift workers, however, is much more complicated. Nightshift  workers are almost always required to be awake when  their internal clocks are telling them to be asleep and  asleep when their internal clocks are telling them to  be awake. As a result, nightshift workers often feel  very sleepy while at work and do not have good sleep  quality during the day. Generally, nightshift workers  TABLE 2. Summary of two proposed lighting schemes recommended for older adults living at home, in assisted living  facilities, or in nursing homes.

Rather, they are typically exposed  to rather “ﬂ  at” or aperiodic light exposures. Figure  7a illustrates one of these ﬂ  at and aperiodic light exposures for one nightshift worker. Figure 7b shows a  much more consolidated, light-during-the-day and  dark-during-the-night pattern for a dayshift worker.  This ﬂ  at and aperiodic light proﬁ  le is not well suitable for circadian entrainment and, due to this  poor entrainment, their performance, health, and  well-being can become compromised. For example,  nightshift women are signiﬁcantly more susceptible  to breast cancer than population matched dayshift  women. The most appropriate lighting scheme for nightshift workers is still debated, mostly because of  the possible negative impact of working at a time  when our body is telling us to be asleep. In the late  1980s, Stevens put forward the melatonin hypothesis wherein high incidence of breast cancer in industrialized society was related to exposure to too  much light at night, which, in turn, suppressed the  production of nocturnal melatonin (Stevens 1987).  Stevens’s hypothesis stimulated various lines of research, from animal models to epidemiological  studies. Blask and colleagues were among the ﬁrst  to use an animal model to investigate the effects of  melatonin on certain types of tumor growth (Blask  et al. 1999; Blask et al. 2005). Their studies clearly  showed a relationship between nighttime light exposure, melatonin suppression, and growth rate of  certain types of cancer. Epidemiological studies in  humans suggest a high cancer risk associated with  rotating shift workers (Schernhammer et al. 2001).  Based on these ﬁndings, nightshift workers are exposed to light at night, which would then suppress  melatonin, depriving nightshift workers from protection against cancer. It is important to note that  a direct link between light at night, melatonin suppression, and cancer initiation has never been established in humans. What remains to be determined is  whether the higher cancer risk is the result of light at  night, or is the result of circadian disruption caused  by a lack of a regular 24-hour, cyclic light exposure  FIGURES 7A AND 7B.

Measurements were made continuously starting at 15:00 on 30 January 2006 until  approximately 15:00 on 31 January 2006 for the nightshift worker and starting at 15:00 on 1 December 2005 until 14:30  on 2 December 2005 for the dayshift worker.

(Figueiro et al. 2006.) pattern like that shown in Figure 7a. Because it is  still unknown what the most appropriate lighting  scheme for the circadian system of nightshift workers is, a lighting recommendation for nightshift  workers will not be discussed here. USING LIGHTING TO PROMOTE  EQUITY FOR CAREGIVERS  IN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES The lighting principles for older adults discussed  herein are applicable to dayshift workers working in  healthcare facilities. It is important that lighting systems for healthcare facilities promote high circadian  stimulation of workers during the day without impacting the circadian systems of nightshift workers,  so the most appropriate alternative is to add a layer  of blue light to the space provided by local lighting.  This local lighting can be used by dayshift workers  only until more is known about the most appropriate lighting for nightshift workers. When designing  lighting for caregivers in healthcare environments, it  is important to keep in mind that the lighting systems in these facilities are used throughout the 24hour day/night and have to meet the needs of both  dayshift and nightshift workers—therefore, ﬂexibility is imperative.  Guidelines for lighting for dayshift workers’  circadian system Unlike older adults who tend to stay indoors most of  their waking hours, dayshift workers are more likely  to be exposed to high circadian stimulation from  outdoor lighting during their waking hours. Nevertheless, it is still important to ensure that they are  receiving sufﬁcient circadian stimulation during the  daytime hours while at work, especially in winter  months when daylight periods are reduced.  Because ﬂexibility is needed and compliance to  lighting intervention may not be an issue for dayshift workers, it may be more cost effective to add  a layer of blue light to the space to promote circadian entrainment of dayshift workers. For example,  a local lighting system providing 30 lux of blue light  (λmax = 470 nm) at the cornea can be effective for  the circadian system (Figures 8a and 8b). Welldesigned daylight that penetrates the space without  glare should always be considered in the healthcare  environment to help dayshift workers’ exposure to  morning light.  Guidelines for lighting for dayshift  (and nightshift) workers’ visual systems Studies conducted by the Lighting Research Center  showed that the recommended light levels of 500 lux  on the work plane can be reduced by 20% without  being noticed by users. Therefore, overall ambient  light levels can be reduced and task lights should be  used to increase light levels in critical areas, such as  reading and writing areas, examination rooms, and  emergency rooms.  Light sources used in the healthcare environment should allow for good color perception. Color  perception is the result of the neural characteristics of the observer’s visual system, the SPD of the  FIGURES 8A AND 8B. Light boxes using blue Leeds peaking at 470 nm and delivering 30 lx at the cornea are a good  solution for healthcare applications. light source, and, if the light source serves as an illuminant, the spectral reﬂectance of the object. in  order to guarantee good color perception, Rea et  al. (2004) and Figueiro et al. (2006b) propose that  light sources have a minimum color rendering index  (CRI) value of 80, a minimum full spectrum color  index (FSCI) value of 55, and a gamut area index  (GAI) value between 65 and 100. While it is not  within the scope of this article to present a comprehensive discussion of color perception, for more  information see Rea et al. (2004). In brief, CRI is  the conventional measure of light source color rendering, but has been shown in a number of studies  to be inadequate as the sole measure of adequacy of  a light source for providing color information. To  complement CRI, FSCI and GAI were developed to  help ensure good color rendering by a light source.  FSCI uses an imaginary equal energy spectrum with  the same radiant power across the entire visible spectrum as a reference source and scales all other light  sources in terms of their ability to provide radiant  power throughout the spectrum. GAI is a measure  Incandescent  2800  100  72  49 RE80 fluorescent  3500  81  67  68 Cool white fluorescent  4000  62  73  58 “Full-spectrum” fluorescent  5500  88  94  89 Ceramic metal halide  4100  93  93  80 High pressure sodium  2000  16  16  14 of the color separation between objects illuminated  by a light source. CRI, FSCI, and GAI can all be  calculated from the SPD of the light source; lamp  manufacturers can provide specifiers with these  three quantities. Table 3 shows CRI, FSCI, and GAI  for various commercial light sources.  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  Table 4 summarizes the lighting principles for  dayshift workers in healthcare applications. The  proposed lighting scheme should suffice the needs  of daytime workers’ visual, circadian, and perceptual systems. The lighting principles for the visual  and perceptual systems are applicable to nightshift  workers, but the lighting scheme for the nightshift  circadian system is still unknown and was not discussed here. CONCLUSIONS As Bill McDonough stated in his book and as exempliﬁed in this article, sustainable lighting should be  designed with more than illuminance (lumens per  area) and lumens per watt in mind. Public awareness  about how lighting can make important contributions to the quality of life of those working and living in healthcare facilities needs to be built so that  architects and speciﬁers can respond. Without that  demand, architects and speciﬁers will only rely on  the existing, but outdated and inadequate, lighting  codes and standards. As exempliﬁed in this article,  lighting that is designed with the visual, circadian,  and perceptual systems in mind can help the most  fragile humans improve their quality of sleep, reduce  TABLE 4. Summary of proposed lighting schemes for dayshift workers in healthcare applications. Dayshift Worker Visual Circadian Perceptual Daytime (work) 400 lux horizontal CCT: 3000–4100K 30 lux at the cornea of blue  LED for at least 1 hr in the  morning λmax = 470 nm N/A Evening (home) <200 lux horizontal CCT: 2800K or lower <50 lux at the cornea CCT: 2800K or lower N/A Nighttime (home) N/A N/A Motion sensor controlled  doorframe lighting 1–5 lux of well distributed  (diffuse) light at the cornea CCT: 2800K or lower falls, and improve their health and well-being. It is  unfortunate that these lighting design principles are  not being widely practiced. As already noted, well-intentioned energy codes  are to blame because they are based upon the implicit, but erroneous, notion that sustainability deals  with only the efﬁciency “E.” Initial attempts to include design issues related to the circadian system  have been made in documents such as the Green  Guide for Healthcare, but these concepts have not  been implemented in the design of healthcare environments. It is time for the public to demand that  architects and speciﬁers pay more attention to the  equity “E” by bringing research into practice. In that  way lighting will meet the needs of all three human  domains: visual, perceptual, and circadian. It is  hoped that the concepts and tips presented in this  article can help transform the basis for our lighted  environments. Remember, all of us will become older  and one day we too might be condemned to an unsustainable lighted environment.      Physical environmental stimuli that turn healthcare facilities into healing environments through psychologically mediated effects: systematic review Aim. This paper reports a systematic review to determine the effects of physical environmental stimuli in healthcare settings on the health and well-being of patients. Background. The concept of healing environments suggests that the physical environment of the healthcare setting can encourage the healing process and patients’ feelings of well-being. Understanding the effects of physical environmental stimuli will allow us to design healthcare environments that generate these potential health beneﬁts. Method. A search was conducted using the MedLine, PsychInfo, Embase, CINAHL, Iconda, ScienceDirect, Compendex and the ISI Citation Indexes databases. Studies were included if they concerned interventions involving health effects of environmental stimuli in healthcare settings on patients, and were based on controlled clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Both clinical and psychological outcome measures were included. The search was completed in 2005. Findings. Of the over 500 potentially relevant studies identiﬁed, only 30 met all criteria and were included in this review. Predominantly positive effects were found for sunlight, windows, odour and seating arrangements. Inconsistent effects were found for sound, nature, spatial layout, television and multiple stimuli interventions. In general, both the size and direction of effects seem highly dependent on characteristics of patient populations and healthcare settings. Conclusions. Studies that manipulate several environmental stimuli simultaneously clearly support the general notion that the physical healthcare environ- ment affects the well-being of patients. However, when scrutinizing the effects of speciﬁc environmental stimuli, conclusive evidence is still very limited and difﬁcult to generalize. The ﬁeld thus appears to be in urgent need of well-conducted, controlled clinical trials. At present, and on the basis of the available research, it would be premature to formulate evidence-based guidelines for designing healthcare environments. Keywords: evidence-based design, healing environment, healthcare management, interior design, nursing, systematic review Introduction Traditionally, the emphasis on designing healthcare settings was on the functional delivery of health care (Ulrich 1995). Gradually, this emphasis shifted towards a perspective of designing healthcare environments that are ‘psychologically supportive’ (Ruga 1989), also referred to as healing environments (see Stichler 2001, Sloan Devlin & Arneill 2003, Schweitzer et al. 2004). The concept of healing environments suggests that the physical environment of healthcare settings ‘can make a difference in how quickly the patient recovers from or adapts to speciﬁc acute and chronic conditions’ (Stichler 2001, p. 2). Understanding physical environmental stimuli in healthcare facilities will allow us to create environments that positively affect the healing process and well-being of patients. Healing environments are claimed to have beneﬁcial effects on a variety of health indicators, such as anxiety, blood pressure, postoperative recovery, the use of analgesic medication, and the length of stay (Ulrich 1995). Moreover, if relatively inexpensive alterations such as introducing plants or colours can indeed shorten the length of stay, then these environmental changes may also prove to be highly costeffective. Previously conducted reviews on this topic (see Rubin et al. 1998, Ulrich et al. 2004, van den Berg 2005) clearly state that environmental stimuli in the healthcare environment affect patient outcomes. These reviews each make their own contribution to the ﬁeld, whether by including non-clinical evidence or by taking a broad scope involving both patients and staff and also including stimuli that provide a direct physiological hazard. However, a critical overview of methodologically rigorous studies is still lacking. Such an overview of the available conclusive evidence is needed to enable the formulation of practice guidelines for evidence-based design of healing healthcare facilities. Physical environmental stimuli Harris et al. (2002) distinguished three relevant dimensions of the physical environment: architectural features, interior design features and ambient features. Architectural features are relatively permanent characteristics, such as the spatial layout of a hospital, room size and window placement. Interior design features are deﬁned as less permanent elements, such as furnishings, colours and artwork. Ambient features comprise lighting, noise levels, odours and temperature. Another classiﬁcation, introduced by Rice et al. (1980), subdivides physical environmental features into either purely stimulus objects or interactional objects. This is illustrated by the following example: plants – as an interior design feature – may serve as stimulus objects when patients are passively exposed to them (i.e. visually), whereas they become interactional objects as soon as patients are actively involved in taking care of them. This example also shows that some features can be classiﬁed in both categories, depending on how they are applied. This review is restricted to purely stimulus objects. Psychologically mediated effects In general, there are two ways in which stimulus objects can impact the health or well-being of patients. First, they can have a direct physiological inﬂuence, meaning the effects are mainly unmediated or unmoderated by psychological processes (Taylor et al. 1997). For example, a carpeted ﬂoor contains more microorganisms than a vinyl ﬂoor (Anderson et al. 1982) and may therefore have a direct physiological inﬂuence on patients’ health by causing more infections. Second, environmental stimuli may act through psychological processes as a result of sensory perceptions. These processes can be of a cognitive or an emotional nature. For instance, the presence of plants in a hospital bedroom may give the patient a more homely feeling resulting in less anxiety, which in turn may promote recovery. This review is restricted to this second category of processes. However, several stimuli inﬂuence health directly as well as through mediation by psychological processes. Carpeted ﬂoors, for instance, may not only have the aforementioned, direct physiological effect, but also an indirect effect by providing a more homely ambience or by improving acoustic conditions. In these ambivalent cases, studies were only included when the outcome measures were indicative of psychologically mediated effects. Taking the example of carpeted ﬂoors, we thus included studies with outcome measures such as arousal or calmness, but excluded studies measuring the number of respiratory infections. Environmental stimuli can also be (part of) a speciﬁc medical treatment, as in light therapy for patients with seasonal depression (Golden et al. 2005). Studies in which environmental stimuli were applied as treatment were excluded from this review. In summary, for the purpose of this review, physical environmental stimuli were deﬁned as follows: Physical environmental stimuli are part of the (shared) healthcare environment and can be classiﬁed as ambient, architectural or interior design features that are purely stimulus objects (i.e. not interactional) and which inﬂuence patients through mediation by psychological processes. Aim The aim of this review was to achieve a rigorous evidence base that could serve as a source for both the design of healthcare environments and for future research. Search methods The review was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration method (Alderson et al. 2003). Electronic searches were carried out using databases on medicine, psychology and architecture, namely MedLine, PsychInfo, Embase, CINAHL, Iconda, ScienceDirect, Compendex and the ISI Citation Indexes. Some of the medical subject headings (MeSH) used in the searches were: interior design and furnishings, hospital design and construction, environment design and health facility planning. However, they were neither adequate to fully identify all relevant studies, nor were they suitable for all databases used. Therefore, an additional set of search terms was used for the type of healthcare setting (e.g. hospital, waiting room), environmental stimuli (e.g. furniture, colour) and outcome measures (e.g. well-being, blood pressure), even though this meant over-selecting potentially relevant studies. The following 17 environmental stimuli were explicitly sought for: furniture, art, colour, nature, plants, gardens, carpeting, room size, spatial layout, private rooms, noise, music, odour (i.e. a smell, pleasant or unpleasant), television/video, light, windows and view from a window. There were no limitations on the year in which the study was published. The only language restriction was an abstract provided in English, German, Spanish, French or Dutch. The reference lists of the previously published reviews were also sought (Rubin et al. 1998, Ulrich et al. 2004, van den Berg 2005) and the ﬁnal electronic search was performed in the summer of 2005. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Criteria for considering studies for this review were: (i) interventions involving the health effects of environmental stimuli in healthcare settings compared to other environmental stimuli, or with no environmental stimuli at all; (ii) clinical trials with at least an adequate control group and published in peer-reviewed journals; (iii) patients staying in a healthcare setting for any length of time; and (iv) health-related outcome measures. Clinical outcomes such as length of stay, medication intake or pain were included as were psychological outcomes such as mood, stress or satisfaction with received care. Environmental stimuli were deﬁned according to our deﬁnition stated in the Introduction. Studies that manipulate a single environmental stimulus – as well as those manipulating multiple stimuli simultaneously – were included. Studies were excluded if the environmental intervention(s) were confounded with non-environmental changes, such as changes in the nursing care policy. Data extraction For all the trials included, methodological quality was assessed. Information about study design, baseline measurements and data sources was extracted, as was information about the environmental stimuli, participants (age, gender, type of disease), healthcare setting (type and size) and measurement tools used. Results Search results The search strategy revealed 4075 papers. After applying the inclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 533 papers remained which were retrieved for a full-text screening. This screening led to the exclusion of 290 non-empirical papers. Another 83 studies were excluded because they adopted study designs other than controlled trials. Table 1 sets out other reasons for exclusion. Thirty studies were ﬁnally included in this review. Methodological characteristics of the studies Only controlled clinical trials were included to ensure methodological quality. Of the 30 studies included, 18 could be described as controlled clinical trials and two as randomized controlled clinical trials. The other 10 studies were categorized as natural experiments, of which seven were conducted retrospectively. Most studies were not truly randomized, but groups were comparable at baseline. However, baseline differences were found for four studies but not adjusted in data analyses. Data retrieved from patient admission forms and automated systems were assumed to be reliable. The majority of the studies used self-reported measures as outcomes and these were also assumed to be reliable. Data collected in studies using observational measures were judged to be reliable when two or more raters scored at least 90% agreement or a kappa of 0Æ8. This was the case in two observational studies. Four studies did not present a kappa value. Meta-analyses could not be executed due to the unique characteristics of the interventions (30 studies on 17 different environmental stimuli), healthcare settings, outcome measures and patients, causing clinical heterogeneity. Effects of physical environmental stimuli No studies were retrieved that exclusively examined the manipulation of the following environmental stimuli: colour, art, plants, gardens, carpeting and room size. Most of these stimuli, however, were manipulated simultaneously in combination with several others. In this review, we sought studies manipulating a single environmental stimulus, as well as studies manipulating multiple stimuli at the same time. These multiple stimuli studies may support the general notion that the physical healthcare environment is capable of affecting the health and Table 1 Articles excluded from the review Reason for exclusion n Non-empirical articles 290 Articles not studying effects of environmental stimuli 77 Articles not studying effects on patients 10 Articles not studying effects in a healthcare setting 7 Articles adopting study designs other than controlled trials 83 Articles lacking an adequate control condition 15 Articles confounding with non-environmental changes 10 Articles using the environmental stimulus as therapy 9 Articles studying the social environment 2 Total 503 well-being of patients. The results of the multiple stimuli studies will thus be presented ﬁrst. Multiple stimuli An entire renovation or redecoration project allowed for the examination of the simultaneous effects of multiple environmental stimuli. The 11 studies were subdivided into type of setting (entire wards, treatment areas, waiting rooms) and will be described below. If available, speciﬁcs on the environmental stimuli modiﬁed can be found in Table 2. Entire wards Outcome measures in the six trials that remodelled an entire ward can be roughly divided into two types, namely: (1) health- and behaviour-related measures; and (2) outcome measures regarding appraisal of the physical environment. Mainly positive effects were found on these environmental appraisals. For the health and behaviour-related outcomes, primarily involving cognitively impaired or older patients, effects were highly inconsistent. Holahan and Saegert (1973) found more socializing and less isolated passive behaviour on a remodelled ward than on a control ward, but found no differences for non-social active behaviour. Christenfeld et al. (1989) also reported some positive effects. They found that patients’ negative self-image showed greater improvement in the remodelled wards. No differences were found for depression, irritability and social isolation. Tyerman and Spencer (1980), on comparing an institutional with a normalized ward, showed that the normalized environment improved measures of occupation and activity, but only slightly affected patterns of interaction and communication. Remarkably, the normalized ward was associ- ated with poorer self-help skills than the institutional ward. Harwood and Ebrahim (1992) found even more negative effects when comparing a new and purpose-built ward with a refurbished one. The purpose-built ward showed no effects on disability scores and mortality, whereas Barthel scores (activities of daily living index) improved considerably for the refurbished ward. Stahler et al. (1984) compared a redecorated dayroom with a control room. Although they found a positive result for pathological behaviour, several negative effects were also observed in the redecorated room. Isolated passive behaviour, hostility and tension increased, whereas sociability and selfmaintenance skills decreased. Olsen (1984) compared a progressive-care unit (a less hospital-like environment) with a traditional unit and found more positive effects on medical-surgical patients. Patients in the progressive-care unit felt less conﬁned and more positive, showed more social activity and mobility, and less passive behaviour. There were no differences in perceived quality of nursing care, perceived boredom and depression. Three of these studies also measured subjective appraisals of the physical healthcare environment. Holahan and Saegert (1973) found more positive attitudes toward the physical environment on the remodelled ward. Olsen’s (1984) progressive care unit was rated more pleasant and cheerful. The effects found by Christenfeld et al. (1989) were less consistent. Treatment areas Three trials focused on the effects of a total redecoration of treatment areas. Two types of outcome measures were studied, namely appraisal of the physical environment and pa- tient’s rating of their physician. Janssen et al. (2000) compared the differences between single room maternity care (SRMC) and a traditional delivery care situation, using a satisfaction survey. The SRMC-group rated the physical layout higher with respect to spaciousness, availability of supplies, comfort of the support person and lighting. Vielhauer Kasmar et al. (1968) found similar results on comparing two contrasting counselling rooms, labelled as either ugly or beautiful. The ugly room was rated less favourably on several aspects. Swan et al. (2003) found that patients even evaluated both food service and the whole hospital more positively when staying in the more appealing rooms. They also had stronger intentions to use the hospital again. However, it should be noted that patients self-selected the appealing room by paying $40 per day extra and may therefore have been positively biased in their evaluations. Patients in the study by Swan et al. (2003) also rated their attending physician more favourably and a similar but nonsigniﬁcant tendency was also found for nurses. Similar effects were found by Janssen et al. (2000). In their study, the SRMC-group was not only more satisﬁed with the information and support received, but also the nursing care was rated higher. The results of Vielhauer Kasmar et al. (1968) are less convincing with respect to these positive ﬁndings regarding patients’ evaluation of the physicians and nurses. They showed no main effects on patients’ rating of the physician. Waiting rooms Two trials studied redecorated waiting rooms. Here, positive effects were also found for appraisals of the physical environment. Ingham and Spencer (1997) created three waiting room layouts: a baseline condition, an increased de ´cor condition and an added comfort condition. They found that dental patients in the added comfort condition rated the practice as more considerate than patients in the increased decor condition, who rated the practice as more considerate than those in the baseline condition. The quality of the practice was rated lower by patients in the baseline condition than by those in the other conditions. Patients in the added comfort condition were more relaxed, secure and comfortable than those in the other two conditions. Leather et al. (2003) compared a redecorated environment with a more traditional waiting area. They found that both affective appraisal and satisfaction were higher for the redecorated waiting area. No effects were found on selfreported arousal. The results of these multiple stimuli studies may support the general notion that the physical healthcare environment affects the behaviour and well-being of patients, but to what speciﬁc environmental stimuli can these effects be attributed? What clinical research is there that presents conclusive evidence of the effects of speciﬁc environmental stimuli? Ambient features The physical (healthcare) environment was distinguished into three dimensions: ambient, architectural and interior design features. With the ﬁrst dimension, the so-called ambiance of the healthcare environment, included studies focused on sunlight, sound and odour (see Table 3). Sunlight Findings from the four studies investigating the effect of sunlight showed mainly positive effects on the length of stay, mortality rate, perceived stress and pain. However, it should be noted that detrimental effects were found for patients with a speciﬁc type of depression, indicating that sunlight is not necessarily beneﬁcial to all patients. Beauchemin and Hays (1996) found that depressed patients had a shorter length of stay (16Æ9 days) in sunny rooms than those in dull rooms (19Æ5 days). Benedetti et al. (2001) showed that patients with a bipolar depression had a shorter length of stay (19Æ8 days) in rooms with morning sunlight (with higher amounts of lux) than in rooms with evening sunlight (23Æ5 days). Remarkably, for patients with unipolar depression the difference was marginally signiﬁcant, favouring evening sunlight rooms (20Æ9 days) to rooms with morning sunlight (23Æ1 days). Beauchemin and Hays (1998) found that patients with a ﬁrst myocardial infarction had a shorter length of stay in sunny rooms than in dull rooms, but the statistically Table 3 Study characteristics for studies investigating effects of ambient features Author/date Method Participants and setting Interventions Outcome measures Beauchemin and Hays (1996) Natural experiment, retrospective Data retrieved from admission forms Beauchemin and Hays (1998) Natural experiment, retrospective Data retrieved from admission forms Benedetti et al.

They also found that mortality was higher in dull rooms (11Æ6%) than in sunny rooms (7Æ2%). In a prospective study of the effects of sunlight, Walch et al. (2005) showed that patients who had undergone spinal surgery and were exposed to higher-intensity sunlight experienced less perceived stress, marginally less pain, took 22% less analgesic medication, and thus accounted for pain medication costs which were 21% lower. For the studies by Benedetti et al. (2001) and Beauchemin and Hays (1998), clinical heterogeneity was found, data from Beauchemin and Hays (1996) were missing and could not be retrieved, so meta-analysis was not possible. Sound Four trials studied the effects of different aspects of sound on patient health and well-being. Mainly positive effects were found if the intervention aimed to prevent negative effects of noise. Adding sound to the environment as a positive distractor showed highly ambiguous results. Hagerman et al. (2005) focused on preventing negative effects of sounds. They studied the effect of noise-absorbing ceiling tiles on patients admitted to an intensive coronary care unit. The rehospitalization rate was statistically signiﬁcantly higher in the bad acoustics group, as was the need for extra intravenous beta-blockers. Subgroup analyses showed statistically signiﬁcant effects favouring the noise-absorbing con- dition for pulse amplitude in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris. In addition to these clinical outcomes, good acoustics positively affected perceived quality of care. Sound may also be included in the environment as a positive distractor. Williamson (1992) studied the effects of ocean sounds during the night on postoperative coronary artery bypass graft patients after transfer from an ICU. Patients hearing ocean sounds scored statistically signiﬁcantly higher on a scale measuring self-reported sleep, indicating better sleep. Two trials were included that studied the effects of a speciﬁc type of sound, namely music, as part of the ambient environment. Ferguson et al. (1997) studied the effects of music during blood donation and showed that playing music had either detrimental or beneﬁcial effects on environmental appraisals, depending on patient characteristics. Effects of music on mood were negligible. Thorgaard et al. (2004) studied the effects of music on the perceived pleasantness of the sound in a cardiac laboratory. In the music group, 91% of patients undergoing coronary procedures described the sound environment as pleasant/very pleasant, compared with 56% in the non-music group. Odour Only one study was included that studied the effects of ambient odour. Lehrner et al. (2000) diffused an ambient odour of orange essential oil in the waiting room of a dental practice, and found statistically signiﬁcant results for women only. Women in the odour group reported less pretreatment state anxiety, improved mood and increased calmness. Architectural features The second dimension of the physical healthcare environment is the architectural features, i.e. the relatively permanent aspects of the healthcare environment. Studies focused on effects of windows and spatial layout (see Table 4). Windows Three studies investigated the effects of windows on the health and well-being of patients. Research focused on the presence or absence of windows, but also on the content of the view afforded from them. Both the presence of windows and a natural view have positive effects on clinical outcomes, such as delirium, sleep and the length of stay. Two studies investigated the effects of windows in intensive care units (ICU) versus a situation without windows. Keep et al. (1980) sent questionnaires to patients with varying diagnoses after discharge. They found that those treated in the ICU with windows remembered their admission and discharge more accurately and had better orientation for day of the week and time of day. They also experienced less sleep disturbance and visual disturbance and suffered less from hallucinations and delusions. Wilson (1972) studied the effects of windows on surgical patients retrospectively. Data were extracted from admission charts and demonstrated that patients in the windowless unit had statistically signiﬁcantly less delirium reactions following surgery. One study focused on the content of the view from a window. Ulrich (1984) retrospectively studied the effects of a view of nature versus a view of a brick wall. Patients with a natural view had shorter postoperative hospital stays, had fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses, took fewer moderate and strong analgesics doses and had slightly lower scores for minor postsurgical complications. Spatial layout Three studies investigated the effects of changes in spatial layout on patient health and well-being. Most effects of spatial layout appear to be inconsistent, but some positive effects were found concerning perceptions of privacy. First, Pattison and Robertson (1996) compared a bay ward (bays of four or more beds parallel with the corridor and the external wall) with a Nightingale ward (long, single, openplan room) where female patients were nursed after surgical procedures involving similar degrees of postoperative discomfort. Patients scored higher on disturbance due to noise on the Nightingale ward than on the bay ward, but no Table 4 Study characteristics for studies investigating effects of architectural features Author/date Method Participants and setting Interventions Outcome measures Keep et al.

Marginally statistically signiﬁcant differences for level of anxiety were found, with higher levels of anxiety on the Nightingale than the bay ward. The mean levels of depression were higher on the Nightingale ward, but this effect was not statistically signiﬁcant. Second, as a consequence of a different spatial layout, the level of privacy may be affected. Barlas et al. (2001) compared the effects on privacy of curtained areas in an emergency department with rooms with solid walls. They found that patients in the curtained areas believed more often that they could overhear others and that others could hear them, view them, hear personal information and view personal parts of their bodies. In short, they perceived a lower sense of privacy. Dolce et al. (1985) assessed the use of narcotic analgesics in orthopaedic inpatients with pain-related back disorders, comparing private with semi-private rooms. They found no differences in observed narcotic use between room types for oral time-contingent, intramuscular time-contingent or oral request-contingent medications. Intramuscular request-contingent medication use was higher in private rooms than in semi-private rooms. However, after controlling for other variables in a multiple regression analysis, this effect of room type appeared non-signiﬁcant. Interior design features The third dimension of the physical healthcare environment comprises the interior design features, i.e. the less permanent aspects of the healthcare environment. Here, research focused on the effects of natural elements through images or video, on the presence or absence of a television and on seating arrangements (see Table 5). Nature Two trials involved the introduction of natural elements either through images or video. Some positive effects were found on both pain control and pulse rate. However, most effects resulting from these manipulations were either nonsigniﬁcant or only small. Diette et al. (2003) compared the effects of natural murals and nature sounds on patients undergoing ﬂexible bronchoscopy with a control group without either. Pain control during the procedure was better in the intervention group. No differences in patient-reported anxiety were found. Ulrich et al. (2003) studied the effects on blood donors by comparing a videotape of a nature setting, a tape of an urban environment, daytime television and a no-television condition. Pulse rate was lower during Nature than Urban, Table 5 Study characteristics for studies investigating effects of interior design features Author/date Method Participants and setting Interventions Outcome measures Holahan (1972) Controlled clinical trial Data retrieved by observations and selfreported measures 120 hospitalized male psychiatric patients Dayroom Seating patterns: (1) Sociofugal (chairs arranged shoulder to shoulder along the walls of the room) (2) Sociopetal (chairs arranged around two small tables in the middle of the room) (3) Mixed (chairs arranged both along the walls and around a small table in the middle of the room) (4) Free (patients were told to arrange the chairs themselves in any manner they wished) Conversation Verbal games Other verbal Total verbal Non-verbal games Other non-verbal Total non-verbal Total social Non-social active Non-social passive Diette et al.

No statistically signiﬁcant results were found for blood pressure, although there were non-signiﬁcant tendencies in the predicted direction. There were no main effects found on variables such as fear, arousal, anger/ aggression, sadness, positive affects and attentiveness/concentration as a function of environmental interventions. Television Ulrich et al. (2003) used television to introduce natural elements in a healthcare setting. Pruyn and Smidts (1998), on the other hand, studied whether the presence of a television in the waiting room had any effect on the waiting experience of patients. Watching intensity appeared highly dependent on the length of the wait. They found that the presence of a TV does not serve as a distractor in a waiting room in terms of changes in the waiting experience when compared to a waiting room without a TV. Seating arrangements Holahan (1972) studied the effect of different seating arrangements on hospitalized male psychiatric patients. He observed that in sociopetal (i.e. encouragement of interactions) and mixed arrangements statistically signiﬁcantly more social and personal interactions occurred than in sociofugal (i.e. discouragement of interactions) and unstructured arrangements. Discussion Limitations The purpose of this review was to achieve a rigorous evidence base of the effects of physical environmental stimuli on the health and well-being of patients. The systematic search and selection process revealed only 30 studies in which these effects were rigorously investigated. This number of included studies is surprisingly low when compared with the number of studies retrieved in previously conducted reviews on this subject (Rubin et al. 1998, Ulrich et al. 2004, van den Berg 2005). This difference is mainly caused by the fact that we only included controlled clinical trials, whereas the previous reviews included almost all types of study designs. It could be argued that this limitation regarding study design was too stringent. Clearly, by excluding all other study designs in this review, a large body of potentially supportive evidence is discarded. However, this supportive body of evidence had already been incorporated in the earlier reviews. Moreover, the explicit purpose of this review was to collect the available conclusive evidence, allowing the formulation of practice guidelines for evidence-based design. This necessarily implies a critical selection on the basis of methodological rigour. As randomized and controlled clinical trials are generally accepted as the most reliable methodology for assessing effects of healthcare interventions (Schulz et al. 1995), the inclusion criteria used in this review seem justiﬁed. By using the Cochrane review methodology, the research in the ﬁeld of healing environments was subjected to the same rigour as is generally accepted in clinical research and practice. Results of the review Three relevant dimensions of environmental stimuli were distinguished, namely ambient, architectural and interior design features. Of the 30 included trials, 11 appeared to study a simultaneous manipulation of multiple environmental stimuli. Stimuli such as colour, art, plants, gardens, carpeting and room size were not studied in isolation from other environmental stimuli, but most of these stimuli were manipulated simultaneously in combination with several others. The multiple stimuli studies concerned redesigning waiting rooms, treatment areas and entire wards. For several of these studies, positive effects were found for patients’ environmental appraisal, but with regard to patients’ evaluations of physicians and nurses, the results were less convincing. Conﬂicting results were also demonstrated for social behaviour and no effects were found on clinical outcomes. It could be concluded that renovating or redesigning healthcare environments in general is appreciated by patients, but evidence of clinical effects is still lacking. Moreover, the conﬂicting results for social behaviour also show that renovation may have negative consequences for speciﬁc types of patients and should therefore be planned carefully. Nine included trials studied ambient features. Positive effects were found for several ambient features, with the most convincing results for exposure to sunlight. However, speciﬁc effects appeared to be highly dependent on the characteristics of the patient population. Designers should thus be prudent when using these ﬁndings to design healthcare environments. The six trials that studied architectural features showed inconsistent effects: positive effects on both clinical and psychological outcomes and statistically non-signiﬁcant outcomes on several measures. Methodological ﬂaws in most of these trials, moreover, impede drawing causal inferences. For example, the reported effects of windows may have been confounded by varying amounts of daylight or by the content of the view, which were not considered. Isolated interior design features were researched in only four trials. Adding natural elements only caused slightly positive effects. Seating arrangements have effects on social interactions, but a television set does not improve the waiting experience. In general, for interior design features the available evidence is very limited. Although interior design features were involved in several of the multiple stimuli trials, it is difﬁcult to attribute positive effects from these trials to speciﬁc features. Remarkably, the previously conducted reviews that included all types of evidence tended to draw considerably more favourable conclusions with respect to the power of healing environments than this review. This suggests that studies with less rigorous methodology tend to show more positive results than more rigorously controlled trials – an inference also drawn by Rubin et al. (1998). Conclusions The ﬁeld appears to be in urgent need of well-conducted, controlled clinical trials. We sought 17 different environWhat is already known about this topic • The focus in designing healthcare facilities is shifting from an emphasis on the functional delivery of care towards healing environments which are also psychologically supportive. • The physical healthcare environment is believed to affect the health and well-being of patients. What this paper adds • Only 30 well-conducted controlled clinical trials were found on the effects of environmental stimuli on the health and well-being of patients. • The general notion that the physical healthcare environment affects the well-being of patients is supported, but conclusive evidence is still limited or lacking with regard to speciﬁc environmental stimuli. • Predominantly positive effects were found for sunlight, windows and odour, but the effects of sound, nature, spatial layout, television and multiple stimuli interventions were inconsistent. • At this stage, formulating guidelines for evidence-based design of healthcare facilities seems premature. mental stimuli as possible interventions to affect the health and well-being of patients. We found only 30 trials that met the criteria for both relevance and methodology. Studies manipulating several environmental stimuli simultaneously support the general notion that the physical healthcare environment affects patient well-being. However, when looking at the effects of speciﬁc environmental stimuli, conclusive evidence is still very limited and difﬁcult to generalize. Single environmental stimuli thus need to be explored further. Several environmental stimuli, such as colour, have still not been studied rigorously, whereas the evidence for other environmental stimuli is still inconclusive. Effects of many stimuli appeared to be highly dependent on the characteristics of the patient population. Most stimuli have thus far been studied in only one or two trials, leaving no scope for analysing the effects for different patient populations or pool results in meta-analyses. Also, possible interactions between different environmental stimuli need further exploration. It is likely that the effects of different environmental stimuli will reinforce or weaken one another. In none of the 11 multiple stimuli trials were such interactions studied. Furthermore, a clear understanding of the cognitive and emotional processes through which the effects can be mediated or moderated, is imperative. Insight into these processes may provide us with the necessary information to develop truly evidence-based healthcare environments. At present, and on the basis of the available research, the formulation of evidence-based guidelines for designing healthcare environments would be premature. Nevertheless, the available evidence indicates that the concept of healing environments remains a promising ﬁeld for future clinical research.      Introduction A growing body of research has shown that hospital design may directly impact safety in hospitals. It may also indirectly impact safety by triggering adverse events that cause harm to patients and staff. In addition, hospital design may also impact safety in hospitals by working as a barrier to harmful events. This is an emerging ﬁeld of research, and the effects of hospital design on safety are not always well understood. There is no single database in the ﬁeld. High quality research articles are also rare, because many confounding variables are present. As a result, this review includes evidence that was not always generated in critical care settings. Nevertheless, all evidence presented here should also be relevant to critical care. The role of hospital design in patient safety Hospital design refers to the physical environment that includes the indoor environment (e.g. noise, air quality and lighting), the interior design (e.g. furniture, ﬁxtures and materials) and the conﬁguration (e.g. relative locations and adjacencies of spaces) of a hospital. According to the model of system accidents proposed by Reason [1], hospital design may impact patient safety, directly or indirectly, as a latent failure and a barrier. Reason [1] argued that adverse events in hospitals are related to both active and latent failures. Active failures are unsafe acts (slips, lapses, fumbles, mistakes and procedural violations) committed by the individuals in direct contact with the patient. In contrast, latent failures create local conditions that in speciﬁc situations may lead to active failures. Latent failures may become embedded within systems as a result of wrong decisions made by designers, builders, procedure writers and top level management [2]. As a latent failure, hospital design can directly impact safety outcomes or it can impact staff outcomes negatively (e.g. staff stress, fatigue, annoyance, lack of control, lack of motivation, and lack of communication) leading to accidents and errors. Reason [1] also argued that design barriers may be critical to preventing harmful accidents in hospitals. Whereas a poorly designed and maintained hospital provides the conditions that precipitate accidents, a well-designed hospital can have inbuilt safeguards/barriers that may make it difﬁcult for these accidents to occur or that may help stop the chain of events before they result in accidents. Purpose of review This paper reviews recent research literature reporting the effects of hospital design on patient safety. Recent ﬁndings Features of hospital design that are linked to patient safety in the literature include noise, air quality, lighting conditions, patient room design, unit layout, and several other interior design features. Some of these features act as latent conditions for adverse events, and impact safety outcomes directly and indirectly by impacting staff working conditions. Others act as barriers to adverse events by providing hospital staff with opportunities for preventing accidents before they occur. Summary Although the evidence linking hospital design to patient safety is growing, much is left to be done in this area of research. Nevertheless, the evidence reported in the literature may already be sufﬁcient to have a positive impact on hospital design. Keywords adverse events, architecture, hospital design, patient safety, physical environment Hospital design cannot, however, be considered in isolation with regard to patient and staff safety. In almost all safety situations, hospital design interacts with a host of other factors, such as the culture of the organization, tasks and processes in place, and tools and technology. This paper primarily focuses on the role of hospital design while recognizing the contributing role played by other critical factors. Direct impacts on patient safety Aspects of hospital design such as air quality, lighting, patient room design and other interior design elements can directly impact safety outcomes such as nosocomial infections, patient falls and medical errors. Air quality and nosocomial infections Airborne infections are spread when dust and pathogens are released during hospital construction [3–5,6\u0001] and are caused by contamination and malfunction of hospital ventilation systems [7–10]. Studies in hospitals show that fungal load in the air may be linked to humidity, temperature and construction activity [6\u0001]. High-efﬁciency particulate air (HEPA) ﬁlters can be highly effective in preventing airborne infections in hospitals [11]. Air contamination is least in laminar airﬂow rooms with HEPA ﬁlters, and this approach is recommended for such areas as operating-room suites and ultraclean rooms for immunocompromised patients [11,12,13\u0001]. Yavuz et al. [13\u0001] found lower rates of sternal surgical site infections in the newer operating rooms with laminar ﬂoor ventilation systems and automatically closing doors compared with the older operating rooms with standard plenum ventilation and doors that did not close properly. Single bedrooms and nosocomial infections Ulrich et al. [14] identiﬁed 16 studies linking the number of patients in a room to nosocomial infection rates. The European Prevalence of Infection Control in Intensive Care study reported an odds ratio for infection of 1.3 in intensive care units (ICUs) with more than 11 beds compared with those with fewer than ﬁve beds. That study, however, did not report any ﬁndings related to open versus closed rooms [15]. Mullin et al. [16] reported a decrease in Acinetobacter baumanii in mechanically ventilated patients, from 28.1 to 5%, after moving from a unit with both enclosed and open patient care areas to one with all private rooms. In general, the reported evidence shows that single-bed patient rooms with high-quality HEPA ﬁlters and with negative or positive pressure ventilation are more effective in preventing air-borne pathogens. The evidence also shows that multibed rooms are more difﬁcult to decontaminate and have more surfaces that act as a reservoir for pathogens. On the basis of the study ﬁndings, the 2006 American Institute of Architects Guidelines for Design and Construction of Healthcare Facilities has adopted the single bed room as the standard for all new construction in the United States [17]. In addition, several other professional and scientiﬁc bodies in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe have published ICU design guidelines that include similar design measures to control nosocomial infections [18]. Lighting conditions and patient outcomes A large body of literature reports different psychological and physiological effects of lighting in hospitals, some of which may be directly related to patient safety. For example, ‘ICU psychosis’ in adult patients can be partly attributed to bright or constant lighting conditions in ICUs that lack night/day cues. A similar phenomenon has been described among children in pediatric ICUs [19,20]. In addition, the mortality rate may be higher in dull patient rooms, with sex having differential effects [21,22]. Furthermore, poor lighting conditions may negatively impact physiological developments among infants [23]. Those studies suggest that lighting conditions should be considered more carefully in the design of patient care areas of a hospital. Lighting conditions and medical errors Performance on visual tasks gets better as light levels increase [24]. Buchanan et al. [25] found that errors in dispensing medications in a high volume outpatient pharmacy were signiﬁcantly lower at an illumination level of 146 foot-candles (2.6%) as opposed to the baseline level of 45 foot candles (3.8%). In Alaska, Roseman and Booker [26] found that 58% of all medication errors among hospital workers occurred during the ﬁrst quarter of the year when daylight hours were less. Studies in ofﬁces have indicated the importance of appropriate lighting levels for complex tasks requiring excellent vision [27], but no such study has been reported in hospitals. Noise in hospitals and patient outcomes Noise levels in most hospitals are higher than World Health Organization recommendations [28]. The level of noise in the ICU ranges from 50 to 75 dB, with peaks of up to 85 dB [29]. Parthasarathy and Tobin [30] reported that 20% of all arousals and awakenings among ICU patients are related to noise. They argued that sleep disruption can induce sympathetic activation and elevation of blood pressure, which may contribute to patient morbidity. ‘ICU psychosis’ in adult ICUs and in pediatric ICUs has also been partly attributed to a high level of noise in these areas [19,20]. Common sources of noise in hospitals may include telephones, alarms, trolleys, ice machines, paging systems, nurse shift change, staff caring for other patients, doors closing, staff conversations, and patients crying out or coughing [31]. Cropp et al. [32] counted 33 different audio signals in a respiratory critical care unit. Ten were critical alarms requiring immediate nursing action, whereas the others did not require immediate action or were unnecessary.It is clear that patient safety as it relates to hospital noise can easily be improved if proper design and management measures are in place. Hospital design and patient falls A report by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations cited the physical environment as a root cause in 50% of patient falls [33], but studies have shown contradictory evidence on the topic. A recent review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials did not ﬁnd any evidence for the independent effectiveness of environmental modiﬁcation programmes on patient falls [34\u0001]. Some studies, however, have shown that most patient falls occurred in the patient room and that bedrails were the only design element linked strongly with falls [35\u0001\u0001]. Other studies have shown that comprehensive multi-intervention strategies that include environmental modiﬁcations could be effective in reducing falls [35\u0001\u0001,36–38]. Among speciﬁc interior design elements, ﬂooring can contribute to the incidence of falls and the severity of injuries upon impact [39\u0001]. Donald et al. [40] reported fewer falls of geriatric patients on vinyl ﬂoors compared with carpeted ﬂoors in a rehabilitation ward. That study lacked sufﬁcient power, however. Healey [41], on the other hand, reported that patients suffer more injuries when they fall on vinyl ﬂoors compared with carpeted ﬂoors. Simpson et al. [42] reported that subﬂoors may impact the injury from falls, with the risk of fracture being lower for wooden subﬂoors compared with concrete subﬂoors. Impact of the environment on staff working conditions A poorly designed physical environment creates latent conditions such as staff stress, fatigue, annoyance, burnout and lack of handwashing compliance that may potentially lead to adverse events in hospitals. Noise in hospitals and staff outcomes Studies have shown that noise is strongly related to stress and annoyance among nurses, and that noise-induced stress is related to emotional exhaustion and burnout among critical care nurses [43,44]. Healthcare staff have reported that the excessively high noise levels at work interfere with their work and impact patient comfort and recovery [45]. Blomkvist and colleagues [46] examined the effects of changing the acoustic conditions (using sound-absorbing versus sound-reﬂecting ceiling tiles) on the same group of nurses in a coronary ICU. During the periods of improved acoustic conditions, many positive outcomes were observed among staff, including improved speech intelligibility, reduced perceived work demands and perceived pressure and strain [46]. There is convincing evidence that noise is a latent condition for errors in hospitals and strategies must be adopted to reduce noise. Variable acuity patient rooms and transfers Patients are transferred from one room to another as often as three to six times during their short stay in hospital in order to receive the care that matches their level of acuity [47,48]. Delays, communication discontinuities, loss of information and changes in computers and systems during patient transfer may contribute to increased medical errors, loss of staff time and productivity [48,49]. Hendrich and colleagues [47,48] developed an innovative demonstration project called the Cardiac Comprehensive Critical Care at Clarian Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to address patient transfer and associated errors. The project provided different levels of care in a single patient room to minimize patient transfer as acuity levels changed. For this, each patient room was equipped with an acuity adaptable headwall, and all nurses on the unit were trained to respond to patients with varying acuity levels. The impact of this 56-bed variable acuity unit on different outcomes was measured by comparing 2 years of baseline data (before the move) and 3 years of data after the move. The authors reported signiﬁcant postmove improvements in many key areas: patient transfers decreased by 90%, medication errors by 70%, and there was also a drastic reduction in the number of falls. This path-breaking project demonstrated the potential impact of acuity-adaptable care in dealing with patient ﬂow and safety issues while improving the model of care. Since this project, many hospitals across the United States have adopted some variations of the concept, although the impacts of these changes on outcomes remain to be studied. Unit layout and staff effectiveness Nurses spend a lot of time walking, which includes the time to locate and gather supplies and equipment and to ﬁnd other staff members [50\u0001\u0001]. One study found that 28.9% of nursing staff time was spent walking [51]. This came second only to patient-care activities, which accounted for 56.9% of staff time. Unnecessary walking leads to a waste of precious staff time and adds to fatigue and stress among staff. Studies seem to suggest that bringing staff and supplies physically and visually closer to the patient may help reduce walking [52,53]. To take advantage of the idea, many hospitals incorporate decentralized nurses’ stations and supplies’ servers next to patient rooms (as opposed to locating everything at a single central location). Hendrich and colleagues [48] argued that such a layout may help reduce walking and supply trips. As a result, nursing time may increase signiﬁcantly allowing for a reduction in budgeted stafﬁng care hours while increasing the time spent in direct patient care activities. An in-depth discussion on how various aspects of unit design, patient room design and staff areas may contribute to staff effectiveness is provided in the review of best practice examples of adult ICUs designed between 1993 and 2003 by Rashid [54\u0001\u0001]. Accessibility to handwashing stations and handwashing compliance Surface transmission of pathogens accounts for a majority of nosocomial infections, and low handwashing frequency among healthcare staff (generally below 50%) is a key factor contributing to this problem [55]. Design factors that discourage handwashing include: difﬁculty of access, poor visibility, poor height placement, lack of redundancy, and wide spatial separation of resources that are used sequentially while washing hands [55–58]. Studies report conﬂicting evidence on the effects of physicaldesignonhandwashing compliance.Some studies found that handwashing compliance was greater in units with higher sink to bed ratios [59,60]. One study found no signiﬁcantimprovementinhandwashingafteramovefrom an open ward design to a layout with single patient rooms and higher sink to bed ratios [61]. Trick and colleagues [62\u0001] found that hand hygiene improved during the study period in three intervention hospitals (where interventions included the increased availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, an interactive education programme and a poster campaign) but not at the control hospital (where the only intervention was the increased availability of alcohol hand rubs). Those and other studies seem to suggest that a multistrategy intervention that includes staff education as well as easy visual and physical access to sinks, standard locations of sinks in all patient rooms, comfortable sink heights and alcohol-based dispensers may be more effective in increasing handwashing compliance [55,58]. Environmental barriers/defenses to healthcare accidents The environment potentially acts as a defense to adverse events by providing opportunities for staff and families to prevent accidents before they occur. Visibility to patients One important way to avert adverse events related to patients is for the staff to have the ability to observe patients continuously and provide assistance as needed. Multiple decentralized nurse work areas and charting alcoves next to patient rooms may help facilitate this activity. Such designs enable the staff to attend patients’ needs without delays. In at least one prospective study, Hendrich [63] showed that falls were cut by two-thirds, from six per 1000 patients to two per 1000, after a move from an old unit with a centralized nursing station to a new unit with decentralized observation units. Additional research is needed to determine the effects of decentralization on patient safety. Visibility to patients also seems to be related to perceived safety. In a staff survey by France et al. [64] at a new neonatal ICU and pediatric critical care unit at a children’s hospital (designed with single patient rooms, curtains for privacy for families, larger unit size, but with poor sightlines between staff and patients), a majority of the respondents believed that the facility design made team communication and patient monitoring difﬁcult ,and that it limited social interaction among staff. Therefore, while making major facility changes it is critical to take into consideration patient needs for privacy as well as staff needs for monitoring and communication. Presence of family Another effective way to avert adverse events is to allow the patient’s family to be a part of the patient care process. In order to understand how teamwork and communication involving the patient’s family may contribute to patient safety, Uhlig and colleagues conducted multidisciplinary collaborative rounds at the patient bedside in 1999 in a cardiac surgery programme in Concord, New Hampshire [65]. These rounds also involved the patient’s family. The team participated in 10-min brieﬁngs at the patient’s bedside at the start of the day, and reviewed the patient’s care plan, discussed medication and addressed anything that went wrong in an open, blame-free environment [53,64]. After these changes, patient mortality rates declined signiﬁcantly [66]. In order to include families as active participants in the care process it is important to provide spaces for families in the patient room and on the unit where they can spend extended periods of time. Single rooms have clear advantage over multibed rooms in this regard as a result of increased privacy [14,67\u0001\u0001]. A survey of nurses in four hospitals found that nurses gave high ratings to single rooms for accommodating family members but accorded double rooms low scores [67\u0001\u0001]. In addition to these factors, organizational policies such as those that limit family visitation hours may inﬂuence family involvement and satisfaction with care. Conclusion Hospital design may help improve patient safety directly by reducing nosocomial infections, patient falls, medication errors and, sometimes, even by reducing patient morbidity and mortality. Hospital design may also help improve patient safety indirectly by reducing staff stress, staff walking and patient transfer, and by improving handwashing compliance. In contrast, very little has been reported recently on the role of hospital design as a barrier to adverse events in hospitals. Although research on the links between hospital design and safety has increased over the past few years, there is still a need for more focused studies. Some reported contradictions on these links also need to be resolved. Meanwhile, the growing body of evidence in the ﬁeld may already have an impact on how hospitals should be designed in the coming years. References and recommended reading Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as: \u0001 of special interest \u0001\u0001 of outstanding interest      Health care design professionals, planners, and administrators cite the advantages of private patient rooms, including reduction of hospital-acquired infections, reduction of patient stress levels, and facilitation of nurses’ and health care workers’ efficiency [e.g., Ulrich, R. (2003). Creating a healing environment with evidence-based design.

(2004). The role of the physical environment in the hospital of the 21st century: A once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity. http://www.healthdesign.org/research/reports/ physical_environ.php]. A review of the literature revealed that operating costs are reduced in singlepatient rooms compared with multioccupancy rooms due to reduction in transfer cost, higher bed occupancy rates, and reduction in labor cost. In addition, single rooms can positively impact patients’ hospital experience through increased privacy, better interaction between family and staff, and reduced noise and anxiety. This pilot study focused on nurses’ perception of the advantages and disadvantages of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy patient rooms in medical–surgical units in four hospitals in the northwest. A majority of respondents in the four hospitals favored single rooms over double-occupancy rooms for the majority of the 15 categories, including the following: appropriateness for patient examination, interaction with or accommodation of family members, and lower probability of dietary mix-ups. Future studies need to carefully examine the objective measures of patient care variables (e.g., incidents of medication errors, opportunities for surveillance), patient outcomes (e.g., recovery rate, falls), and implications of room occupancy on operating costs.

Background Demographic changes in the United States, such as the aging of the baby-boom generation, increasing life expectancy, and continued immigration, could result in a 46% increase in bed demand in hospitals by 2027 (Solucient, 2003). An increasing number of patients attend hospitals with a higher level of acuity, requiring complex care. In addition, the continuous upgrading in medical technology has generated the need for built-in flexibility in the design of hospital facilities. A recent extensive review of the literature evidence-based design in acute care settings has demonstrated that patient-centered and psychologically supportive acute care environments facilitate positive patient outcomes, such as increased patient privacy, increased patient control over personal information, and increased opportunity to rest and to discuss needs with family members and friends. The challenge for today’s hospital designers and administrators is to design patient rooms that promote therapeutic goals, foster positive patient outcomes, and function as intensive care rooms. Single-patient rooms have become the industry standard in the construction of new acute care facilities in the United States. Health care design professionals, planners, and administrators argue that private patient rooms reduce the possibility for infection, reduce patient stress levels, facilitate nurses’ and health care workers’ ability to do their jobs efficiently, provide adequate space for family members to participate in the healing process of the patients, and provide more privacy for the delivery of bedside treatments and for sensitive discussions with health care personnel (e.g., Bacon, 1920; Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Gallant & Lanning, 2001; Hill-Rom, 2002; Ulrich, 2003; Ulrich et al., 2004). However, are these claims supported by empirical evidence? How does this need to address increased acuity, as well as the need to promote therapeutic outcomes, affect patient density issues in patient room design? A systematic review of the literature by the authors demonstrated that single-occupancy rooms compared to multioccupancy rooms are more suitable for infection control and patient care issues (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Muto et al., 2003; Ulrich et al., 2004). However, no study on the nursing staff members’ perception of single-occupancy and multioccupancy patient rooms in acute care settings as it relates to patient care issues was found. The objective of this research was to conduct an exploratory pilot study to explore nursing staff members’ perception of the advantages and disadvantages of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy patient rooms in medical–surgical units. The research questions guiding this study were as follows: 1. What are the differences in operating costs, efficiency of management, care delivery, and disease control in single-occupancy and double-occupancy patient rooms in acute care settings? 2. What are the therapeutic impacts (socio-behavioral issues of patient privacy, social interaction, and daily functioning) of single-occupancy versus double-occupancy hospital rooms? A summary of the literature on single-occupancy and multioccupancy patient rooms is presented below to provide background information for this study (a detailed summary of this review is provided in Chaudhury, Mahmood, & Valente, in press). This review was conducted through a keyword search of relevant databases. The databases searched were as follows: Medline, EBSCO Host, ABI/Inform, Ageline, 1 Journals/magazines/newsletters searched for relevant articles: (1) architecture and design—Journal of Healthcare Design, Hospital Design, Journal of Healthcare Interior Design, Journal of Architectural and Planning Research; (2) hospital and healthcare—Journal of Healthcare Management, Managed Healthcare Executive, Health Facilities Management, Hospitals, Hospital and Healthcare Network, Modern Healthcare, Healthcare Forum Journal, American Journal of Infection Control, Journal of Hospital Infection, American Journal of Critical Care, American Journal of Nursing, Facilities Design and Management, Health Services Management, Nursing Times, Critical Care Nursing Quarterly, Healthcare Financial Management; (3) social, psychological, and behavioral issues—Social Science and Medicine, Journal of Environmental Psychology, Environment and Behavior, Behavior Research and Therapy, Health Psychology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology; (4) others—The Gerontologist, Canadian Journal of Aging, Journal of Gerontology (Psychological and Social Sciences), Journal of Gerontological Nursing, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.

Second, potential studies were identified by a systematic review of issues of relevant journals/ magazines in the area of health care design, management, and infection control.1 Finally, the reference lists for included articles that dealt directly with room occupancy issues were inspected, followed by a systematic review of issues of relevant journals/magazines in the area of health care design, management, and infection control. 2. Key findings from the literature The major issues of the literature were synthesized in three categories, and articles in each category were subdivided into empirical and nonempirical articles.2 The three categories are as follows: 1. Cost issues of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy rooms 2. Infection control 3. Health care facility management/patient care and therapeutic impacts. In terms of cost and management issues, the articles were mainly nonempirical and prescriptive in nature. The focus of the limited number of empirical studies identified by the researchers was mainly infection control issues (e.g., the need for isolation to limit the spread of nosocomial infection), with a few studies examining the therapeutic benefits of single-occupancy rooms (e.g., Burden, 1998; Kulik, Moore, & Mahler, 1993). 2.2. Cost issues of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy rooms Most of the articles reviewed on cost issues were descriptive articles in the form of opinions or guidelines.3 The opinions expressed in these articles emphasized that operating costs are reduced in single-patient rooms compared with multioccupancy rooms due to reduction in transfer cost, higher bed occupancy rates, and reduction in labor cost. However, the authors often cautioned that this cost reduction could be better achieved when conversion to single room is paired with other healing environment design principles. Some authors (Hill-Rom, 2002; Ulrich, 2003) have argued that cost savings due to reduction in transfers are particularly applicable with acuity-adaptable rooms. 2 Articles providing primary data were included in the discussion of empirical studies, and articles that were descriptive in nature or provided a review of the literature were included in the discussion of nonempirical studies. 3 A few empirical articles were identified in Section 2.1, and they dealt with overall cost issues in the hospital and did not focus on patient room types and associated costs. Articles that dealt with infection control and cost were grouped in Section 2.2. According to some authors (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas, 2000), even with higher first or unit costs of construction, furniture, maintenance, housekeeping, energy (e.g., heating and ventilation), and nursing, single occupancy can match the per-diem cost of multibed rooms because of higher occupancy rates. Additionally, others have argued that medication errors are reduced in single-occupancy rooms in comparison to multioccupancy rooms, resulting in reduced costs (e.g., Hill-Rom, 2002; Morrissey, 2003). 2.3. Infection control in single-occupancy versus multioccupancy rooms Most empirical articles on patient room issues were in the area of infection control.4 The nonempirical articles were either guidelines or reviews of the literature on existing studies on infections (e.g., Muto et al., 2003; Sehulster & Chinn, 2003). Both empirical and nonempirical articles highlight that infected patients or patients who are highly susceptible to infections need to be isolated in private rooms with proper ventilation systems and barrier protections to stop infection from spreading or to reduce the possibility of the development of a new infection. Ongoing research demonstrates that nosocomial infection rates are low in private rooms with proper design and ventilation systems; however, the data from these studies have not yet been published (The Center for Health Design, 2003). In areas with specific types of infections, Kappstein and Daschner (1991) argued the need for private rooms for patients with staphylococcal pneumonia, skin lesions, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The Society of Healthcare and Epidemiology of America guidelines recommend isolation for patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. In studies of transmission of hospitalacquired diarrhea, researchers have discovered that the transfer of different types of diarrhea occurred between patients sharing rooms and toilets (Korpela, Karpanoja, Taipalinen, & Siitonen, 1995). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is endemic in many hospitals; results in high average hospital stay, high average cost per case, and significant morbidity in patients; affects nurses’ workloads; and adds to the cost of cleaning and laundry. Research has demonstrated that physical proximity to a patient with CDAD and the number of antibiotics taken were significant risk factors for the acquisition of nosocomial CDAD (Chang & Nelson, 2000). Additionally, research has demonstrated that the isolation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients in hematology wards prevented patient-to-patient nosocomial HCV transmission (Allander et al., 1995; Silini et al., 2002). Caution must be used when interpreting results from infection control literature because findings and recommendations are often based on retrospective investigations of infection outbreaks in particular hospitals and associated contextual variables. They may or may not be applicable to other acute care environments. 4 The articles cited in this section are empirical, unless noted otherwise. 2.4. Therapeutic benefits of single-occupancy versus multioccupancy rooms Empirical (e.g., Burden, 1998) and nonempirical literature (e.g., Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Shumaker & Reizem- stein, 1982) point out that single-occupancy rooms increase patients’ privacy; provide patients with control over personal information, an opportunity to rest, and an opportunity to discuss their needs with family members and friends; and reduces noise and crowding. A few scholars (e.g., Gallant & Lanning, 2001; Ulrich, 2003) and hospital designers have argued that specially designed private rooms (such as universal rooms or acuity-adaptable rooms), compared with traditional private rooms, may better serve the therapeutic goals of hospitals.5 Empirical studies have demonstrated that excess noise can lead to increased anxiety and pain perception, loss of sleep, and prolonged convalescence (Baker, Garvin, Kennedy, & Polivka, 1993; Hilton, 1985). The influence of room occupancy on the type of pain medication usage is mixed. Some researchers discovered that patients in private rooms were more likely to use narcotics than were similar patients in semiprivate rooms, which may be due to decreased environmental stimuli in private rooms, whereas others have demonstrated that pain medication intake is less in single-occupancy rooms (Dolce, Doleys, Raczynsk, & Crocker, 1985). Mixed results were also obtained in studies and surveys of patients’ preferences for room design. This might be partly attributable to variations in subjective thresholds for pain tolerance in patients, quality of emotional support provided by staff and family, and variations of environmental quality within private rooms 5 Universal rooms or acuity-adaptable rooms are a current trend in design, especially in hospitals that are promoting patient-centered care and family participation in a patient’s healing program. These rooms are all private rooms. Results from a limited number of studies have indicated that medication errors, patient falls, and procedural problems may be reduced in acuity-adaptable rooms (Bobrow & Thomas, 2000; Gallant & Lanning, 2001; Hill-Rom, 2002; Spear, 1997). However, these results may be specific to the particular institutions studied. A more detailed study with examples from multiple hospitals is required before drawing specific conclusions.

The majority of patients prefer single rooms because of greater privacy, reduced noise, reduced embarrassment, improved quality of sleep, opportunity for family members to stay, and avoidance of upsetting other patients (Pease & Finlay, 2002). In addition, both empirical (e.g., Hilton, 1985) and nonempirical articles (e.g., Ulrich, 2003; Ulrich et al., 2004) have stated that multiple-occupancy rooms are associated with lack of privacy, higher noise level, and sleep disturbance. As mentioned earlier, private rooms are the trend in hospital planning and design. Both empirical and nonempirical literature demonstrate the advantages of single-occupancy rooms as improvements in patient care, a reduction in the risk of cross-infection, and greater flexibility in operation. However, the literature also highlights that it is important to view and interpret the benefits of single-occupancy rooms within the context of patient care issues, other environmental changes, and management policy changes to bring about desired and sustainable outcomes. 3. Method Based on the abovementioned literature, a survey instrument was designed to collect data on patient care, management, and infection control issues from nursing staff. The research methodology was reviewed and approved by the authors’ university Institutional Review Board and also by senior administrators at the hospital sites. This instrument was pilot tested with nursing staff members in four hospitals in the Pacific Northwest6 to gain insights into their perception of single-occupancy and multioccupancy rooms as it relates to patient care issues. Cross-sectional data were collected from nursing staff members (e.g., nurse managers, charge nurses, etc.) through structured surveys. Various scales were used to gather data on respondents’ perception of each type of patient room in terms of their physical environmental features and beneficial attributes as they relate to patient care issues. Respondents were asked 15 questions. Using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1=very low; 5=very high), they rated single-occupancy and double6 Researchers focused on hospitals in the Pacific Northwest for pilot study due to geographic proximity. Multiple hospitals in the Seattle and Portland areas were contacted, and four hospitals consenting to participate in the study were included. This article is based on a study that is part of a larger project that included a literature review and first cost analysis of hospital medical–surgical units. Thus, this study required access to the architectural plans of these hospitals. The four hospitals that consented to share the plans of specific medical–surgical units and to participate in the survey were selected for the study.

These items included family members’ participation in care, probability of medication error, and quality of patient monitoring (Table 2 lists all 15 items addressed through this set of questions). To investigate physical environmental characteristics in single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms, 19 questions were asked using a 4-point scale (1=helpful; 4=problematic). Items included the layout of the room, storage space, and heating and cooling (Table 3 lists all these items). 3.1. Participants Participants in this study included both administrative and nursing staff from three hospitals in the state of Washington, and one hospital in Oregon. In total, 77 nursing staff members participated in the study. The hospitals in Washington were Evergreen Hospital (15 nursing staff), Swedish hospital, (26 nursing), and University of Washington Hospital (17 nursing). Providence Hospital participated from Oregon (19 nursing staff). Table 1 provides demographic information on the respondents of the study. 3.2. Procedures Administrators at the four hospitals were contacted for participation in this study. All four hospitals gave their consent to participate. One charge nurse of a medical– surgical nursing unit at each of the four hospitals was contacted to schedule two sessions at a time when the maximum number of nursing staff members would be available for 1-hour periods. One time slot was allotted for dayshift nurses, and one was allotted for nightshift nurses. Nurses from both shifts completed their surveys during these time slots. For the three Seattle area hospitals, researchers met with three groups of nursing staff at the three hospitals and were present while the participants filled out the structured questionnaires. Respondents were told about the purpose of the study, and the surveys were completed by the staff members within 30–45 minutes. Surveys were mailed out to the staff members at the hospital in Oregon. Upon completion, these surveys were returned to the researchers by the administrator of that hospital. All respondents were remunerated with a US$10 Starbucks gift card. 4. Results 4.1. Comparison of single-occupancy versus doubleoccupancy rooms In comparing single-occupancy versus double-occupancy rooms, it is evident that nurses clearly favor singleoccupancy rooms, as demonstrated by data in Table 2.7 For instance, 84% of the respondents rated room flexibility as high or very high in single-occupancy rooms, whereas only 40% of nurses felt that double-occupancy rooms were moderately flexible. In terms of flexibility in private rooms, one respondent stated that, blots of room, private conversations in person and on phone, stay in room.Q Interaction with family members and flexibility in accommodating family members both got high scores (high or very high) in private rooms, whereas in double-occupancy rooms, interaction with family members was considered low (33%) or moderate (47%), and flexibility in accommodating family members was considered low (48%). Single-occupancy rooms were chosen as most appropriate for patient examination (85%) and collection of patient history (82%). However, fewer than half of the respondents rated double-occupancy rooms as low in their suitability for patient examination and collection of patient history. According to one respondent, single rooms are more helpful as there is bmore privacy, room for ambulation within the room.Q According to another respondent, bmy opinion is that I am totally focused on one patient without interruptions [when noting patient history].Q One respondent stated, bcan’t assure confidentiality if there’s another patient in the same room.Q Other factors, such as the quality of patient monitoring, patient’s comfort level, patient’s recovery rate, and scope for patient surveillance, were all rated more highly in private rooms compared to double-occupancy rooms. One respondent stated that b[patient’s recovery rate] could be impacted by loss of sleep due to noisy/sick roommate.Q On the issue of surveillance, one respondent stated, b100% focus on one patient is better than one eye on one patient, another eye on other patient.Q The study respondents perceived that the probability of occurrence of medication errors was blowQ in single-occupancy rooms (43%) and bmoderateQ in doubleoccupancy rooms (40%). The respondents stated that the probability of dietary mix-ups occurring in double-occupancy rooms was bhighQ (34%) to bmoderateQ (36%), whereas in single-occupancy rooms, it was blowQ (55%) to bvery lowQ 7 Responses do not always total 100%. However, even with the missing responses, the findings demonstrate that the nursing staff members in all four hospitals preferred private rooms over multioccupancy rooms. (25%). Thus, the findings demonstrate that the study participants perceived that the probability of medication error was low in both types of rooms; however, double-occupancy rooms had a slightly higher probability of dietary mix-ups. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents stated that the rate of acquiring a nosocomial infection is either low or very low in single-occupancy rooms (vs. 10% respondents in case of double rooms) compared to 11% of respondents stating that the rate is high or very high in single rooms (vs. 46% stating the same for double rooms). The incidence of patient falls was considered moderate in both types of rooms (48%). Similarly, the rate of taking pain-reducing or sleep-inducing medicine was considered moderate in both types of room (37% in single-occupancy rooms and 33% in doubleoccupancy rooms). 4.2. Environmental characteristics in single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms The respondents were asked to rate the environmental characteristics of single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms based on their experiences at their present work setting (see Table 3). The respondents rated many of the environmental characteristics of single-patient rooms as helpful. These included the layout of the room (47%), the availability of space in the room (49%), the arrangement of furniture (47%), privacy (89%), and space for family members (51%). Double-occupancy rooms were thought to be somewhat helpful in terms of being of walking distance from the nursing station (41%) and the visibility of patients for monitoring purposes (40%). The surveillance of patients was considered somewhat problematic in both single-occupancy (40%) and doubleoccupancy rooms (34%). Storage for clean and dirty supplies was considered somewhat helpful in singleoccupancy rooms (33%), but in double-occupancy rooms, storage was considered somewhat problematic (59% for clean supplies and 54% for dirty supplies). The location of the sink, bathroom, door, and window in single-occupancy rooms was rated as helpful by a large majority of respondents (63%, 66%, 67%, and 73%, respectively). Similarly, in double-occupancy rooms, the location of the sink, door, and window was considered somewhat helpful (34%, 41%, and 40%, respectively). The bathroom location, on the other hand, was thought to be somewhat problematic (38%). Data in Table 3 demonstrate that lighting, temperature control, and noise levels were considered helpful in singleoccupancy rooms, but these features were felt to be somewhat problematic or to be problematic in double-occupancy rooms. The data on environmental features in single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms demonstrate that single rooms have more helpful features than multioccupancy rooms. However, one must keep in mind that the environmental features of particular patient rooms are tied to room layout, size, design, and nursing unit layout. Thus, the helpful or problematic aspects of environmental features may vary from hospital to hospital. However, these findings indicate the helpful or problematic aspects of design features in relation to single-occupancy versus double-occupancy rooms within a given hospital. 5. Conclusion This project was a pilot study on nursing staff members’ comparative assessment of patient care issues between single-occupancy and double-occupancy rooms. The findings need to be viewed within the context of the limited sample size of this pilot study (nursing staff, N = 77). In comparing single-occupancy versus double-occupancy rooms, it is evident that the nursing staff clearly favored single-occupancy rooms. Most of the participants responded more favorably for single rooms than for double rooms in the majority of the 15 categories in the comparison questions. The most noticeable categories of positive assessment for single rooms include the following: flexibility in accommodating family, suitability for examination of patients by health care personnel, patient’s comfort level, patient’s recovery rate, less probability of medication errors, and less probability of diet mix-ups. The respondents rated many environmental characteristics of single-patient rooms as helpful. These included the layout of the room (47%), the availability of space in the room (49%), the arrangement of furniture (47%), privacy (89%), and space for family members (51%). Doubleoccupancy rooms were thought to be somewhat helpful in terms of being of walking distance from the nursing station (41%) and the visibility of patients for monitoring purposes (40%). Surveillance of patients was considered somewhat problematic in both single-occupancy (40%) and doublesupplies was considered somewhat helpful in single- The primary objectives of this pilot study were to gather an experience-based assessment from hospital staff members in regard to single-occupancy versus double-occupancy rooms and to examine the relevance of the two survey questionnaires. The results generally support the positive aspects of single rooms from a patient care perspective, as suggested by the literature. Findings need to be interpreted with the limited sample size in mind. Future studies need to examine carefully the implications for operating cost as it relates to associated patient care issues and room density. An in-depth case study approach using multiple methods (e.g., systematic observations, information from data logs, and qualitative interviews) can provide more useful data in regard to complex relationships among patient care issues, operating cost variables, patient outcomes, and staff efficiency, as well as subjective evaluations by patients and family members. However, the above discussion of hospital costs, infection control, falls reduction, and therapeutic impacts as they relate to room occupancy demonstrates that a simple consideration of room occupancy does not provide a complete picture of patient care, cost, or infection reduction issues. Room occupancy issues need to be considered along with other patient care issues, other environmental changes, or changes in management policy to bring about desired outcomes.      The physical environment has a significant impact on health and safety; however, hospitals have not been designed with the explicit goal of enhancing patient safety through facility design. In April 2002, St Joseph’s Community Hospital of West Bend, a member of SynergyHealth, brought together leaders in healthcare and systems engineering to develop a set of safety-driven facility design recommendations and principles that would guide the design of a new hospital facility focused on patient safety. By introducing safety-driven innovations into the facility design process, environmental designers and healthcare leaders will be able to make significant contributions to patient safety. ‘‘We shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us.’’ Winston Churchill, 1941.1 The design of a facility, including its technology and equipment, creates a physical environment in which caregivers provide services. Can this physical environment be designed to improve patient safety? Humans err. The reason for the sentinel 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To err is human: building a safer health system was just that: to stress the fact that physicians, caregivers—in fact the entire human race—all err.2 James Reason and Lucian Leape’s model of error contends there are conditions, which cause interruptions to human neurological systems, and these lead to human error.3 4 If these conditions causing human error are minimized or eliminated in a context such as hospitals, the result should be less human error, leading to fewer adverse events and preventable medical deaths, improved patient outcomes, and improved safety. What are these conditions of human error and Similarly, in his book The challenge of interior design, Kleeman states, ‘‘There are those who assert that essentially the design of an interior space and its location not only can communicate with those who enter it but also controls their behavior.’’6 In The psychology of everyday things, Norman reports that humans do not always behave clumsily and do not always err, but are much more likely to when things they use are badly conceived and designed.7 And finally, Moray sums it up well by saying that ‘‘people of good intention, skilled and experienced, may none the less be forced to commit errors by the way in which the design of their environment calls forth their behavior.’’8 In sum, experts from various fields agree that the physical environment does have a significant impact on safety and human performance. The research done by Reason and Leape testifies to the value of practices based on principles designed to compensate for human cognitive failings. When applied to the healthcare field, these include, for example, standardization, simplification, and use of protocols and checklists.4 Facilities designed to meet fire safety codes, for . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The architect Bruce Mau, in his book Massive change, has this to say about the importance of design: ‘‘For most of us, design is invisible. Until it fails. … When systems fail, we become temporarily conscious of the extraordinary force and power of design. Every accident provides a brief moment of awareness of real life, what is actually happening, and our dependence on the underlying systems of design.’’5 example, impact the health and safety of employees, patients, and families.9 In The role of the physical environment in the hospital for the 21st century: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,10 Ulrich and Zimring reviewed more than 600 articles and found rigorous studies that link the physical environment to patient and staff outcomes in four areas: 1. reduced staff stress and fatigue; increased effectiveness in delivering care 2. improved patient safety 3. reduced stress and improved outcomes 4. improvement in overall healthcare quality. Human factors analysis, ‘‘the study of the interrelationships between humans, the tools they use, and the environment in which they live and work’’, is basic to any study of a hospital’s design and its effect on the performance of the people who interface with the facility and its fixed and moveable equipment and technology.11 As a result, the design of a facility with its fixed and moveable components can have a significant impact on human performance. St Joseph’s Community Hospital of West Bend, a member of SynergyHealth, is an independent, non-profit, 80-bed acute care hospital located in West Bend, Wisconsin, near Milwaukee. Its affiliate, West Bend Clinic, also a member of SynergyHealth, is a multispecialty group of more than 45 physicians serving patients in three locations. In the unique position of building a new hospital, St Joseph’s recognized the opportunity to increase patient safety and promote a patient-safe culture by improving the traditional hospital facility design process. With billions of dollars spent annually on healthcare construction, St Joseph’s identified the need to develop a set of safety-driven design principles that could be used by all healthcare organizations—whether they are building a new facility, remodeling, or expanding an existing facility. Internal discussion at St Joseph’s focused on how design of a new facility could affect patient safety. St Joseph’s contacted leaders in patient safety, quality improvement, and human factors to seek their advice. The belief was that there was an opportunity to learn collectively about how a facility could be designed to improve patient safety. In April 2002, leaders in systems engineering, healthcare administration, health services research, human behavior research, hospital quality improvement and accreditation, hospital architecture, medical education, pharmacy, nursing, and medicine participated in a conference entitled Charting the Course for Patient Safety—A Learning Lab, sponsored in part by a grant from the University of Minnesota, Carlson School Program in Health Administration. These leaders represented organisations such as: American Hospital Association (AHA) N American Medical Association (AMA) N American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) N American Society for Quality (ASQ) N Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) N Institute for Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) N Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) N Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) N National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) N Patient Safety Institute (PSI) N University of Minnesota (U of MN) N University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UW-Milw) N Veterans Administration, Midwest Patient Safety Center of Inquiry (VA) N Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) N Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA)  Derived from the learning lab was the collective belief that safe hospitals could be designed using a process that supports the anticipation, identification, and avoidance of failure; by designing against the latent conditions and active failures which compromise physical and organizational defenses; and, by creating an organizational culture of safety. Participants in the learning lab were instructed to consider human error, why it occurs, and which factors undermine human performance. A great deal of information has been published on dealing with human error from a systems approach.8 12 13 In a systems approach, error reduction is achieved by strategically building defenses, barriers, and safeguards into the facility, equipment, and processes that make up the system. In order to achieve this, an under- standing of the types of errors present is necessary. Reason classifies errors found in complex systems such as healthcare as either active failures or latent conditions.8 14 In medicine, active failures are errors made by those who provide direct care to the patient such as physicians, nurses, and technicians. Latent conditions are those conditions that are present in the system, the facility, equipment, and processes that contribute to or combine with active failures to produce error. Latent conditions typically arise from decisions made by management, architects, and equipment  designers. Examples of latent conditions present in a healthcare facility include lack of standardization of equipment and procedures, poor visibility, high noise levels, and excessive movement of patients. Unlike active failures that are difficult to predict, latent conditions can be identified and remedied with safety barriers before they can contribute to an adverse effect. Safety barriers act to prevent a healthcare provider from committing an active failure or by mitigating the effect of an active failure.15 Participants, through a multi-voting process, created recommendations for facility design, safety culture, and process. The recommendations and principles have been categorized as either process recommendations (box 1), safety design principles (box 2), or safety culture (box 3), and are aimed at minimizing latent conditions, reducing active failures, and creating a facility design process and culture focused on patient safety. The safety design principles specifically address latent conditions and active failures, while the process recommendations identify critical components of the facility design process. The learning lab participants modified the traditional facility process driven by the commitment to patient safety (box 4).  Box 1 Safety design process recommendations 1.

It was also used to prioritize the potential design features, technology, and equipment to maximize safety while maintaining the budgets and capital available. St Joseph’s modeled the matrix using the quality functional deployment technique. The quality functional deployment matrix (house of quality) matches the voice of the customers to technical requirements.16 In our applications the ‘‘voice of the customers’’ were the National Learning Lab requirements for active failures reduction and latent conditions management. Other ‘‘voices’’ were meeting the design principles adopted by the board, and capital cost requirements. Failure modes and effects analysis at each stage of design Few issues about patient safety are raised in the traditional healthcare facility design process. St Joseph’s has redefined this process to include the application of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) at each stage. Faced with no experience in the application of FMEA to healthcare facility design, we looked to other industries for expertise and guidance. The American Society of Quality (ASQ) and an expert in the auto industry provided support and training to design and architect/construction team representatives. The design teams determined the traditional FMEA approach was too complex for healthcare facility design and developed a modified approach. They began by simplifying the FMEA spreadsheet to use a revised severity/occurrence scoring system. Instead of traditional numerical scoring, teams were asked to score failure occurrence and effects as low, medium, or high. This modified process identified potential failures of design and their relative priority, which was an important element in making design decisions. Patients/families involved in the design process Involving patients and family members is an important component in the facility design process. At St Joseph’s, focus groups were held and surveys were conducted at several points in the design process. Focus group suggestions on the patient room design led to an important relocation of the patient chair to allow an unrestricted path to the bathroom. Equipment planning beginning on day 1 Most hospitals begin equipment planning late in the design process. Equipment planning on day 1 ensures that the equipment technology and facility interfaces are maximized to meet the safety objectives. At St Joseph’s, technology options were developed to determine which systems could be implemented immediately or at the completion of the new facility, and those that could be acquired in the future. Priorities included automated systems where possible to eliminate human error, and decision support and patient information available at the point of care. Initial technology plans included centralized scheduling, a nurse call system, pneumatic tube transport, and automated systems for pharmacy, rapid admissions, and management of materials. Mock-up planning beginning on day 1 Many different types of mock-ups exist from two-dimensional to computer generated to physical construction. At St Joseph’s, two mock-up rooms were physically constructed, one on the Medical/Surgical floor and the other in the New Life Center. The rooms went through multiple revisions including such important features as door sizes, locations of patient chairs, and lighting sources and locations. Mock-up rooms can serve two functions in addition to designing a safer environment: simulation on systems, and future education and orientations. With a mock-up, simulations can be conducted on redesigned or current processes such as routine functions, medication delivery to a patient room, or emergency codes and other complex circumstances. Design for vulnerable patients There is a time during each patient’s treatment when they are at their most vulnerable point. This can occur when they first come in for treatment and are very sick, or immediately after treatment such as surgery. During these critical times, particular attention must be given to identify and minimize the risks to the patient. Designing hospital spaces around the common needs of patient groups may require that rooms look and function differently but share similar processes and technology. When making design decisions, the solutions should maximize safety for the most vulnerable patient. Particular attention should be paid to movement of patients, transfers, visibility, and patient room design. Vulnerable patients should typically have limited movement and exposure to the public. This is a consideration when making decisions regarding the adjacencies of departments, location of patient elevators, and ‘‘patient only’’ corridors. In addition, standardized procedures should be used during movement of patients and transfers to ensure that complete and accurate patient information accompanies the patient at all times.    Patient rooms should be designed with maximum visibility. As described earlier, this can be achieved with cameras, windows into rooms from charting alcoves (this will allow visibility without disturbing the patient), and designing rooms in a mirrored image layout where a nurse can view four patients from one location in the hallway. Rooms and bathrooms can be designed larger than a traditional patient room for ease in movement between bed and bathroom. A larger room can also include a comfortable space for family members, which will encourage family involvement and provide additional patient monitoring. Additional considerations to minimize risk to vulnerable patients include standardization of equipment, and the use of common monitoring systems and intravenous pumps. Articulate a set of principles for measurement In order to maintain focus on patient safety, it is important to have a set of safety-driven design principles to guide the design process, and to articulate these principles to all participants involved in the design. In a large building or remodeling project there are often many participants from various backgrounds including architects, contractors, hospital administration and staff, community members, and industry consultants. Many participants may not understand the concepts of latent conditions or active failures, nor appreciate the opportunity to minimize them through facility design. By having a clearly articulated set of safety-driven design principles, all participants will share a common focus and commitment to the design process. Establish a checklist for current/future design Developing a checklist of the safety-driven design principles is an important tool in maintaining focus on patient safety during the design process. At St Joseph’s, design team members were responsible for completing a checklist of the safety design principles, indicating how they addressed each principle in their proposed design. UNDERSTANDING AND MINIMIZING LATENT CONDITIONS AND ACTIVE FAILURES Noise reduction A report by the World Health Organization indicates that noise interferes with communication, creates distractions, effects cognitive performance and concentration, causes annoyance, and contributes to stress and fatigue. Mental activities involving a demand on working memory are particularly sensitive to noise and can result in degradation of performance. In a study by Murthy et al, anaesthesia residents exhibited reduced mental efficiency and poorer short term memory under the noisy conditions of an operating room averaging 77 dB.17 In addition to safety considerations, noise affects the quality of the healing environment for patients. It may elevate blood pressure, increase pain, alter quality of sleep, and reduce overall perceived patient satisfaction. Studies in paediatric intensive care units have shown that noise routinely disrupts sleep that is necessary for patient comfort or recovery.18 The nature of sound and its reverberation rate (how long the sound remains) has a direct effect on the noise level. When the reverberation rate is long there is greater opportunity for sounds to blend together, increasing the noise level. With speech communication, a longer reverberation time combined with background noise makes speech perception increasingly difficult. St Joseph’s has many design features to minimize noise. rooms with insulation between the rooms, more absorbent ceiling tile, and ‘‘quiet’’ equipment and technology. Scalability, adaptability, flexibility Scalability is the ability to expand or remodel easily so that latent errors are not designed into the building expansion. Adaptability is the ability to adapt space for different or evolving services so that latent errors are not built in. Many design and construction concepts can be applied to achieve a scalable or adaptable healthcare facility—everything from open spaces with modular systems, to infra- structure requirements, and expansion zones that support scalable and adaptable buildings. Specific examples that St Joseph’s has incorporated into the facility design include: ceiling heights (floor to floor) to allow for expansion or changes, and wiring or wireless technology that will allow future technology to be easily implemented. Key services located on outside walls allow for expansion sizing of patient rooms and provide greater adaptability. Visibility of patients to staff Visibility of patients to staff is an important issue regarding patient safety and quality in the healthcare setting. There is little debate that healthcare organizations trail their peers in service innovation. In the 19th century, it was said that form follows function. In the 21st century, it is becoming clear that form shapes function. A well chosen form helps providers deliver services more efficiently and cheaply.19 A pod structure allowing close proximity to their patients allows nurses to deliver improved quality, while enabling them to be more efficient and effective. Unit designs must allow caregivers to be visual in proximity to the patients under their care as well as accommodate the more traditional orientations of broader based patient responsibility. This can be accomplished by designing multiple mini-nursing stations throughout the unit, offering alcoves for charting and dictation and allowing for wall desks, whether in corridors or patient rooms. In addition, visibility can be enhanced through patient rooms designed in a mirrored image layout, with adjoining charting alcoves, cameras in rooms, windows in the charting alcoves, and convenient locations of supplies. Patients involved with care According to the IOM report, Crossing the quality chasm, many patients have expressed frustration with their inability to participate in decision making, to obtain information they need, to be heard, and to participate in systems of care that are responsive to their needs.20 Gerteis et al have identified several dimensions of patientcentered care: (1) respect for patients’ values, preferences, and expressed needs; (2) coordination and integration of care; (3) information, communication, and education; (4) physical comfort; (5) emotional support—relieving fear and anxiety; and (6) involvement of family and friends.20 Many of these dimensions have facility implications, including those of equipment and technology. In addition, during a hospital stay, keeping patients and family members informed can also potentially reduce errors or potential errors. For example, patients or their family members should receive a daily schedule of prescribed medication and treatments. They should be encouraged to verify this information with the caregivers administering the medication or treatment. In addition, providing a comfortable space for family members to stay in the patient’s room also facilitates their involvement with care. Examples are: no overhead paging, quiet floor coverings (carpet, rubber), ‘‘quiet’’ HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) systems, private rooms, private standardized Standardization Care standardization could substantially impact the basic consequences of organizational factors, enough to reduce medical errors and improve quality. Errors, like human failures in any other sphere, are not just isolated causes; they are themselves the consequences of upstream organizational factors or latent conditions.3 Facility impact on behavior is a documented and researched relationship in several areas, including commercial aviation and information and communications technology; however very little is known about facility impact on standardization and how it affects the medical error rates and quality of care. Much of the work in human factors focuses on improving the human/system interface by designing better systems and processes. This includes standardization of patient rooms, treatment areas, equipment, and procedures. The standardization of the facility and room design, from the location of the outlets, to the bed controls, to which cupboard the latex gloves are stored, the charting process, even switches on light fixtures—down to the most minute detail—all have an impact on behavior. In The psychology of everyday things, Norman talks about design novelty, stating, ‘‘Users don’t want each new design to use a different method for a task. Users need standardization.’’7 Specific examples to consider in facility standardization are: N Truly standardized patient rooms N Ambulatory care rooms N Gases and equipment N ‘‘Migrating’’ toward standardized IVs, beds, and monitors N Medication systems and other care processes. Automate where possible In Crossing the quality chasm: a new health system for the 21st century,20 the IOM identifies information technology (IT) solutions as a necessary component to improving patient safety. The IOM challenges the government and the healthcare industry to make a commitment to develop an information infrastructure to support healthcare delivery that would lead to the elimination of most handwritten data by the end of the decade. When designing a new healthcare facility, technology planning should begin early in the design process. If possible, ongoing assessment of the type and frequency of errors within the existing institution will assist in determining specific technological needs and setting priorities. To facilitate the decision process, it is beneficial to create a list of those IT systems needed and/or desired and to characterize those systems according to their relationship to one another, impact on patient safety, financial investment, implementation time, and their impact on facility design and operation. The financial investment should reflect the total cost of ownership, including costs for purchase, implementation, maintenance, and staff support. Minimize fatigue Research has identified fatigue as a possible contributing factor of human error.15 Although research has not proven the effects of fatigue on patient safety, studies have shown that fatigue has a negative impact on alertness, mood, and psychomotor and cognitive performance; all of which can have an impact on patient safety.21–23 Studies of surgical residents suggest that manual dexterity and fine motor skills may be compromised as a result of sleep deprivation.24 Shift work and, in certain circumstances, long hours and increased workloads are inevitable in patient care. As a result, minimizing fatigue is a complex issue in hospitals that requires a comprehensive approach. In facility design, this could mean minimizing the distances staff must travel between patient rooms, nurses’ stations, and treatment areas. This could affect not only the number of patient rooms per floor but also vertical and horizontal adjacencies of departments. The use of technology can increase the efficiency of workload and reduce the reliance on short term memory and thought processes. One example is the computerized tube transport system that can either eliminate or significantly reduce the need for staff to hand deliver laboratory specimens, blood products, or medical supplies, thus increasing efficiency of workloads.25 Noise reduction, as previously recommended, is another method of minimizing fatigue in both hospital staff and patients. Additional recommended strategies from the literature include limiting work hours and on-call periods, using forward rotation of shift work (morning to evening to night shifts), developing workstation environments that minimize distractions from patient care, alertness strategies such as napping and caffeine, and education of physicians and staff about the negative effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue and the importance of good sleep habits.22–24 Immediate accessibility of information at the point of service In order to provide patients with the most accurate diagnosis and treatment possible, physicians need to have complete, ‘‘real-time’’ information about the patient, suspected illness, and treatment options. Research has shown that lack of knowledge and information can lead to errors.14 Two significant causes of adverse drug events (ADEs) and potential ADEs are lack of drug knowledge and inadequate availability of patient information.26 Technologies have been developed that can assist physicians and other caregivers with complex cognitive tasks such diagnosis and treatment by providing ‘‘real-time’’ medical information.27 Examples of these technologies include the internet, computer-based patient records, and clinical decision support systems. In addition to technological solutions, other methods for improving the visibility of patient information can be used. Charting alcoves directly adjacent to patient rooms can provide easy access to patient charts without disrupting the patient. In surgery, operating rooms can be equipped with large boards or monitors displaying patient information and scheduled procedures that can be verified against physician instructions and the patient’s chart and medical records. Minimizing patient transfers/handoffs Participants at the National Learning Lab discussed this issue from a variety of perspectives. Transferring patients puts both patient and staff in a vulnerable position in which patients or staff could be harmed, and causes disruption for ill patients. Usually a transfer from a patient room involves multiple transfers. A patient is transferred to surgery or to radiology, transferred to a table in those locations, and usually returns to be transferred to the patient bed again. Often, these transfers involve handoffs: nurse to transporter to radiology tech to transporter to nurse, creating the potential for error or harm. Many other handoffs occur in a facility involving many caregivers, such as physician to nurse to nurse to radiology tech to lab techs, and so on, in high risk circumstances. These conditions are ripe for error. Minimizing patient transfers/handoffs, or minimizing the risk of harm when transferring patients, have many facility design implications. It is safer to design services to come to the patient, not the reverse. This design needs to be adaptable so services in the future can come to the patient. Potential errors due to transfers and handoffs can be minimized by having lifts in every care area in the hospital, barcoding for patient identification, and electronic medical records, so that ‘‘non-traditional’’ areas where medication may be dispensed or delivered; technology applications such as pharmacy decision support, barcoding, computerized physician order entry (CPOE), or electronic medical records (EMR) should be integrated with ‘‘appliances’’ such as IV pumps. N Deaths of patients in restraints. Consider visibility of patients i d i h id f t bl f f il in design phase; provide comfortable space for family members to stay with patient. N Patient falls. Develop bed exit technology to notify caregivers when patients are attempting to get out of bed caregivers when patients are attempting to get out of bed. N MRI hazards. Create a three-zone MRI suite; use a duplicated checklist; use hand-held metal detectors at point of entry; colour code any MRI compatible equipment; consider computer chip technology. Using the recommended tools and methodology focusing on patient safety, St Joseph’s patient room demonstrates minimising latent conditions and active failures through application of the safety design principles and designing around precarious events. The design of the patient room, coupled with technology and equipment recommendations, will institute changes in nursing and physician processes and workflow to increase patient safety. The ‘‘truly’’ standardized patient room reflects the following safety design features aimed at creating a safe, high quality, patient-centered environment: Charting alcove with window to increase patient visibility complete and accurate information is available for caregivers at the point of service where handoffs occur. Designing around precarious events The precarious events (active failures) should be based on a healthcare institution’s own database of sentinel events, adverse events, medical errors and near misses; and then on national databases such as those from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) and the Veterans Administration National Patient Safety Center. According to JCAHO, a sentinel event is an unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof.28 Such events are called ‘‘sentinel’’ because they signal the need for immediate investigation and response. According to the IOM, an adverse event is defined as an injury caused by medical management rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient. A medical error is defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (error of execution) or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (error of planning).2 A near miss is defined as an error that does not result in harm to the patient. The facility design process at St Joseph’s focuses on Patient room, St Joseph’s Hospital, 2005. for nurses, physicians, and staff.

CONCLUSION The 2002 National Learning Lab has had a powerful effect on St Joseph’s and is influencing other hospital facility development, both nationally and internationally. St Joseph’s fully implemented the recommendations of the National Learning Lab, modifying the traditional design process, designing around latent conditions and active failures, and enhancing the facility.

St Joseph’s has also received an AHRQ Grant to assist in the implementation of our major technology platform, Epic, and to assess the impact of the new institution on safety and quality. Studies have been completed on the original St Joseph’s and those same studies will be conducted in 2007 to assess the differences the new facility with its technology and equipment has on latent conditions, active failures, length of stay, patient satisfaction, safety culture, and cost per discharge. The new hospital opened in August of 2005. The planning of the move under the direction of the VP of Patient Care Services, Mike Murphy, evolved over a year’s time, using the tools we used in designing the hospital; FMEA, time outs, standard processes, etc. The outcome was a smooth, incidentfree move. Staff simulated caring for patients for about two months before opening, and oriented themselves to the new facility. A SWAT team was formed for the first few weeks to assist staff in addressing concerns after the opening. This group of employees representing technology services, materials services, clinic services, etc, were available 24 hours a day to support the needs of transitioning employees. The facility opened on time and under budget. In fact, St Joseph’s was able to add significant programs and enhance its safety features as a result of being under budget. The timing of the project allowed us to receive competitive bids with the high level of standardization. For example, cost concerns were expressed about fully standardized patient rooms compared to back-to-back patient rooms. The contractors actually felt fully standardized was at least the same, if not less, cost than back-to-back patient rooms. Opening a new hospital is a dramatic transaction for an organization. New technologies coupled with persuasive process modifications create significant change behavior. As much as we tested the technologies and processes, we still discovered issues around both. The simulations and orientations were very helpful but additional orientation and technology testing would have been useful. We have had an opportunity to conduct tours for many organizations around the opening of the new hospital and after the opening. The effects of the design around latent conditions (box 2) is apparent. Quiet environment, improved air flow, standardization, etc, all exhibit the commitment St Joseph’s had to safety by design. Staff from all areas have expressed their pride for influencing the design so they can provide safe care. It was truly a transforming experience to have been able to participate in the design of St Joseph’s. Architects, mechanical engineers, mechanical architects, general contractors, nurses, administration, board members, physicians all expressed their personal transformation at a recent National Learning Lab celebration. We changed our building and afterwards, our building changed us.

It is difficult to alter the architecture of hospitals after they are  built; therefore, it is necessary to consider various treatmentrelated aspects beforehand, both for the benefits of patients and  health care providers. Traditionally, medicine has pursued evidence-based treatments, which establish a procedure by defining and measuring changes in outcomes, depending on the  presence or absence of a treatment, and by judging their efficacy. Moreover, architecture has introduced the concept of  evidence-based designs. Since any change in the physical environment might affect the progress of diseases in various ways,  the rationale for studying these associations is clear. The belief  that the physical environment of a hospital could affect the  recovery of patients has existed since ancient times; however, it  is difficult to support this assumption, because randomized  controlled trials—although often conducted in medicine—are  rarely adopted in architecture. Medical facilities, whose aims are the prevention and diagnosis of diseases as well as rehabilitation, consist of various  medical place where patients tend to stay for the longest period;  therefore, ward environments directly or indirectly affect treatment outcomes. Many studies have examined the effects of  various physical ward environments on disease outcomes of  including the reduction of hospital-acquired infections. For  example, physicians have strived to reduce iatrogenic infections. Because an infection is caused by contact, physical isola- tion between patients, ventilation system components, and  easy-to-clean facilities are key architectural features. Light is another critical ward environment aspect that not  only leads to a decrease in patients’ distress but can also increase  patient satisfaction.1–4 Full-spectrum light prophylactically  controls viral and staph infections and also significantly  improves physical working capacity by decreasing heart and  pulse rates, lowering systolic blood pressure, and increasing  oxygen uptake.5 Inadequate light has a direct effect on fatigue,  diseases, insomnia, alcohol addictions, suicides, and other psychiatric diseases.6 Therefore, light has been emphasized and  used in the design of medical facilities.1,3 It is noteworthy that  the effectiveness of light can be better understood in relation to  Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential  conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this  article.  ABSTRACT  Background and Purpose: While providing medical services, hospitals generate many data about patients. Such medical data could  contribute to better treatments once their associations or patterns have been identified. With properly analyzed medical data, traditional  knowledge at an individual level could be further extended to broader populations. This comprehensive study was performed to demonstrate  the effectiveness of light using medical data accumulated over 15 years. Methods: Patients who were admitted to the window or door side of a six-bedded room were included. Patients admitted to the emergency  room and elderly people aged >80 years were excluded. Patients’ length of stay was compared per what bed they were in (excluding middle beds). A multiple regression analysis was performed with patients admitted to the window or door side to determine whether the window  affected their hospital stay. In addition, a multiple regression analysis was performed after adjusting for confounders by 1:1 matching  between the two groups (ie, age, sex, and admitting department). Results: Participants were 38 788 patients with a bed near the window and 46 233 patients with a bed near the door. Results revealed that  patients’ length of stay was shorter for those near the window compared with those near the door, which was also true after group matching  (33 921 participants in each group). Conclusions: Clinical trials that test evidence-based designs of physical environments in wards or hospital rooms are usually difficult to  perform. As an alternative strategy, using accumulated electronic medical data, we assessed this key element of hospital design. Keywords: Electronic medical record, database, light, evidence-based design, physical environment length of stay (LOS) because it has been reported that exposure to light affects LOS.3 Generally, while providing medical services, hospitals generate many data about patients, and this massive medical information is accumulated and stored digitally. Such medical data  could contribute to better treatments once their associations or  patterns have been identified. With properly analyzed medical  data, traditional knowledge at an individual level could be further extended to broader populations. Therefore, this comprehensive study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness  of light using medical data accumulated over 15 years. Methods Participants This study used information from a hospital database from  January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2013. With 1031 beds, a hospital ward comprises one-, two-, four-, or six-bedded rooms.  When a patient is hospitalized, he or she is randomly placed in  an empty room in our hospital. Beds close to the door had  restricted light and beds close to the window had light. Length  of stay was defined as the time from hospital admission to  discharge. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Outpatients and patients admitted to the emergency room,  elderly people aged >80 years, persons who were moved to a  hospital within 3 days after admission, and patients admitted  for more than 180 days were excluded. Patients’ data were  included in this study if they had been hospitalized in a sixbedded room and assigned to a bed either next to the window  or next to the door and had not changed beds or rooms (patients  with a bed in the middle were excluded). Study design and independent variable matching A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare the  group that was exposed to natural light (window) and the  group that was not (door). In public health, a retrospective  cohort design can be used to compare groups of individuals.  Recently, the use of observational data has increased, and many  investigators use matching techniques to create a control group  that is similar to the treatment group. We used the exact matching method, that is, select one patient in the case group (win- dow) and one patient in the control group (door) with the same  characteristics (ie, age, sex, admitting department). Because the  data did not include illness severity and LOS can differ based  on department, we matched admitting department. Medical  departments were grouped appropriately. The number of  patients admitted to each department was counted, and the rest  were grouped except for the top five departments. All study  protocols were reviewed and approved by the hospital’s institutional review board. Statistical analyses Chi-square tests were employed to compare categorical variables (ie, age group, sex, and department) at the time of hospi- talization. The Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric data  was employed to compare continuous variables, such as age and  LOS. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to  examine what variables affected LOS. In addition, a multiple  linear regression analysis was again performed after 1:1 exact  matching (see Figure 1). Software tools All data were processed using Eclipse 4.2.2 (IBM, Riverton,  NJ) for Java Programming, MS-SQL 2008 (Microsoft,  Redmond, WA) for the database management system, and the  R package (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) for  statistical analyses. Results LOS analysis before exact matching Participants baseline characteristics and LOS are shown in  Table 1. The age, sex, department, and LOS of both groups  significantly differed. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine  whether there was any difference in LOS between groups after  controlling for confounding variables. After controlling for confounders, the LOS of the window side group was still signifi- cantly shorter than the LOS of the door side group (Table 2). LOS analysis after 1:1 exact matching Participants’ baseline characteristics and LOS after 1:1 exact  matching are shown in Table 3. After matching, all variables  except LOS showed no significant difference between the two  groups. A multiple regression analysis was performed once again,  which determine that light affected LOS after 1:1 exact matching (Table 4). Discussion The focus on productivity and cost-containment in health care  systems is currently a sustaining challenge to hospital management. The LOS in a hospital represents one of the most essen- tial aspects to measure the quality of patient care and it is one  of the most widely used variables to evaluate resource allocation in hospitals. Length of stay is also a critical measure to  determine the required number of beds for hospitals during  planning,7 and it is a key indicator for comparing procedures in  hospitals across countries.8 Allocating beds and resources efficiently by shortening patients’ LOS is a chief way to achieve  maximum productivity in hospitals.9 Reducing LOS restores  hospital capacity, increases productivity and profits, decreases  waiting lists, and heightens patient satisfaction. Furthermore,  the beneficial effects of LOS on the public through the  National Insurance System have been reviewed intensively.  Several methods, such as early discharge planning, have been  recommended for reducing LOS.8 Medical personnel involved  in patients’ hospital care is under certain pressures worldwide  to minimize LOS.10 Because the LOS is a very robust variable  to evaluate the performance of hospitals, we selected it as our  key variable. Some studies have investigated light and its efficacy as part  of the ward environment. Lewy et  al11 found that being  exposed to light had a faster effect than did taking antidepressants; they reported that it took at least 4-6 weeks for an  antidepressant to show its effect in seasonal depressive disorders, whereas light could decrease depressive symptoms  within 2 weeks. Morning light was also more effective than  afternoon or night light. Walch et al12 examined spinal surgery patients and randomly assigned them to two conditions:  a ward with light versus a ward with the light blocked. Being  exposed to more than 46% light, the patients tended to report  less distress and pains than did those in the dark ward, and  they also needed 22% fewer painkillers, which led to 21% savings in total treatment costs. Furthermore, light is especially  effective when targeting patients with psychiatric disorders,  l l d These results suggest that it is vital to consider light in ward  arrangements;3 however, there have been few studies scrutinizing the differences in LOS depending on light conditions.  Beauchemin and Hays13 reported that the LOS of patients  with depression in a bright ward was brief (mean = 2.6 days),  and Beauchemin and Hays14 further found that the LOS of  patients after myocardial infarction, especially women, was  short-lived (mean = 3.7 days). In addition, in Korea, Kim15  showed that light had a positive effect on patients’ resilience,  which decreased their LOS. There have been a few investigations that directly examined  the relationship between light and LOS; however, they examined specific clinical samples. Therefore, it is difficult to gener- alize prior findings to broader populations due to limitations  such as small sample sizes, short research durations, and specificdisease study populations. Consequently, it is necessary to  examine the effectiveness of light on patients with diverse diseases to compensate for such limitations.4 Although we posit that light depending on the location of  beds has the primary influence on LOS, there are other likely  mediating variables. First, light might have affected medical  errors. Many studies have reported that illumination has an  effect on performance, suggesting that a visual inspection could  be disturbed at a low light level.16 In addition, other studies  h d d h d d d ff These results suggest that it is vital to consider light in ward  arrangements;3 however, there have been few studies scrutinizBeauchemin and Hays13 reported that the LOS of patients  Beauchemin and Hays13 reported that the LOS of patients  with depression in a bright ward was brief (mean = 2.6 days),  and Beauchemin and Hays14 further found that the LOS of  patients after myocardial infarction, especially women, was  short-lived (mean = 3.7 days).

Second, light in a ward may have had an influence on sleep.  Experiencing stress due to a disease would reasonably alter a  patient’s sleeping patterns, and defective sleep itself can increase  stress and delirium18,19 and decrease immunity.20 Such processes might elevate the morbidity stemming from diseases.21,22  Given that a light change reflected in the retina is the most  influential factor for circadian rhythm, the nearer a patients is  to a window, the more light he or she gets exposed to, which  might have affected circadian rhythms and consequently lowered his or her LOS. Many studies have reported that a decrease  in light due to the ward design, such as the location of the beds,  leads to poor nighttime sleep.23,24 Other mediators in the ward design are also plausible.  Many investigations have suggested that having a good view  has a positive effect on the treatment outcomes of diseases.  Depending on the presence of a window, some patients  would have had an outside view whereas others would not.  Perhaps watching the “outside world” decreases patients’  stress and improves disease outcomes. In addition, noise  may have affected LOS. Noise can influence performance in  medicine.25 Although some studies raised doubts about the  effect of noise, their crucial limitation was that their experiments lacked real clinical relevance.26,27 Patients next to the  doors could have been exposed to more noise (from outside  the room). In a patient satisfaction survey, noise was  in light due to the ward design, such as the location of the beds,  leads to poor nighttime sleep.23,24 O h d h d d l l bl Characteristics Door side group  (N  =  46  233) Window side  group (N  =  38  788) P-value Table 2.  Summary of multiple linear regression for variables predicting LOS.

Conclusions Through analysis of a large medical database, we demonstrated  that patients with beds next to the window had shorter LOS  than did those next to the door. We posit that this was due to  the presence of natural light. This has implications for hospital  design. Clinical trials that test evidence-based designs of physical environments in hospitals are difficult to perform; therefore,  our alternative strategy of using accumulated electronic medical data has value.      Wayfinding is the ability to find one’s way without getting lost(Passini, Rainville,& Marchand,1998). In itself a simple goal, this can be one of the most stressful tasks in a hospital.That wayfinding constitutes a chronic problem in health care facilities, and potentially affects staff time as well as the organization’s bottom line, is evidenced by multiple articles in professional and academic journals dating back to the 20th century (see for instance, Del Nord, 1999; O’Neill, 1991; Zimring, 1990). Wayfinding problems have been associated with high blood pressure,increasedphysicalaggression,andfatigue in patients (Carpman & Grant, 2001). Furthermore, Rousek and Hallbeck (2011) argue that with an aging population, it is important to also consider patients with visual impairments when designing a wayfinding system. They identified several design elements involving signage, paths/target sites, lighting, and flooring that created navigation issues. The effects of the wayfinding issues on participants ranged from tripping to getting lost in the surrounding environment. The unique needs of the elderly population were further emphasized in a study by Lee and Kline (2011) who demonstrated that younger subjects performed better in wayfinding tasks than an elderly subject group. Although wayfinding has been acknowledged as a key concern in health care facilities, few comprehensive studies of the designed environment in health care facilities are available in pub- lished literature. Disparate studies have identified a few of the environmental attributes that influence navigation, including visual configuration of space, signage, landmarks, architectural differentiation, and symmetry of layout (Ahn, 2006; Baskaya, Wilson, & Ozcan, 2004; Carpman, Grant, & Simmons, 1985). More recently, a position paper published for the Center for Health Design argues that the building blocks of a wayfinding system for a hospital are put in place in the master plan, architecture, interior design, and finally the facility amenities, graphics, and signage. Based on earlier work (Passini & Arthur, 1992), the whitepaper suggests that a person in a hospital, looking for a destination, relies on five wayfinding factors (Huelat, 2007), that is, (1) knowing where he or she is, (2) knowing his or her destination, (3) knowing which route gets him or her to the destination, (4) knowing when he or she has reached the destination, and (5) knowing how to return. The aforementioned literature provided two pieces of key information, that is, (1) navigation inside buildings entails multiple questions, from comprehending where one is to knowing when one reaches the destination and (2) people seek information from multiple environmental sources during navigation inside buildings. In contemporary hospitals, designers hypothesize and implement multiple strategies to aid wayfinding (from personal experience of the authors). Since the implementation of any design strategy is associated with capital cost expenditure, the existing literature lacks information for design prioritization. All capital projects have an upper limit to available funds. It is typical across projects to prioritize and compromise among and between design strategies to complete a project within budget. What strategies, then, should designers accord more importance to? An associated issue important to capital optimization as well as developing strategies across capital projectsisthewayenvironmentalcuesareprocessed in the human cognitive system. It is conceivable that some cues are used for short-term cognitive processing whereas others are retained in long-term mem- ory. Seminal studies on wayfinding in urban environments and complex navigation systems have suggested the concept of ‘‘mental maps’’ or ‘‘cognitive maps’’ (Lynch, 1960; Siegel & White, 1975). These theories suggest that people develop mental representations of the environment they encounter to better comprehend as well as navigate within it. These mental representations incorporate two types of information, that is, a survey-type information that constitute skeletal information at the global scale and route information that are context rich and incorporate environ- mental information at the local scale. Lynch (1960) suggested five types of information that get captured in cognitive maps as people attempt to make sense of their cities, namely, (1) path (streets, sidewalks, trails, and other channels in which people travel), (2) edge (perceived boundaries such as walls, buildings, and shorelines), (3) district (large sections of an urban area distinguished by some identity), (4) node (focal points, intersections, or loci), and (5) landmark (readily identifiable objects that serve as external reference points). Furthermore, Siegel and White (1975) asserted that the mental map is constructed of a series of mini-representations of a large and complex environment. People use such elements as paths to connect representations meaningfully. Little is known regarding the types of environmental information used by people navigating inside buildings to populate and make sense of their cognitive maps.Ifdatacanbegeneratedon(1) what types of environmental information people use while navigating inside buildings—which has already been examined to some extent in published literature, (2) which of the environmental cues are used more frequently—yet unknown, and (3) what roles do the different classes of information play in the development of mini-representations and cognitive maps, such data can serve as valuable design support information. Such information can enable optimization of wayfinding behavior, long-term organizational performance as well as first cost of health care facilities. Objective The specific aim of this study was to examine the nature and extent of aid provided by various design elements in supporting wayfinding decisions by adult visitors in an acute care hospital. Research Questions Considering the paucity of actionable knowledge available in the current scholarly literature, this study addresses three questions: 1. What aspects of the physical environment aid in wayfinding decision making for visitors? 2. How do the various wayfinding strategies compare in frequency of use? 3. What role do environmental cues in health care facilities, such as configuration, color, art, visible landmarks, maps, visual signage, and so on play win the wayfinding process? Methodology A multi-method, nonexperimental, exploratory, qualitative design was adopted for the study. Wayfinding theories on urban environments were used as a starting point to code and classify data. The basic data types included verbal protocol, digital photography, and subjects’ response on a survey questionnaire. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the corporate entity having administrative jurisdiction over the study hospital. Study Setting The study was conducted in an 866-bed, tertiary care facility in Texas. In 2009, a large new addition of 512,000 square feet, coupled with 132,000 square feet renovation of existing buildings, was completed. Considerable attention was given to creating a building design and deliberate features that would assist wayfinding through this large health care complex. As a collection of interconnected buildings, this site offered a unique setting for undertaking this study. End users navigating to a destination may come across settings with different levels of environmental information in the same trip. In the new addition, several design elements and strategies were incorporated to enhance wayfinding. Internet-based research was conducted by the design team to develop hypotheses on the type of elements or strategies that help people navigate through a building. The initial framework identified a variety of environmental information that possibly supports wayfinding, including colors, numbers, landmarks, and orientation by direction or views. More specifically, the following strategies were incorporated: 1. Each floor has its own unique landmarks. For instance, artwork in the elevator lobbies are unique to each floor as shown in Figure 1a. 2. Each floor and each unit has its own unique numbering system. Rooms are identified by unique room numbers ‘‘AB54321’’ identifying the building (AB), the floor number (54), and then the room number (321). For example, a patient tower room numbers start with an H (first alphabet in the building name) followed by the floor number and then the specific room number (e.g., H03210). 3. Each floor has its own views to the outside to orient visitors and maintain a sense of direction. This is most prominent in the waiting areas at the elevator lobby and on the ends of the bed units. Figure 1b Figure 1. (a) Artwork in elevator lobbies.

The art at the footwall of the patient rooms are selected from a series of six photographs so that not every adjacent room has the same footwall photograph (i.e., repetitions occur at a large interval of 80–90 feet). Routes Three different and interconnected buildings were chosen for the study. The buildings included a main hospital, a professional (medical office) building, and a patient tower. A total of 11 sequential origin-destination routes were identified for the study, which covered exterior parking lots and spaces in the three buildings. The destinations covered four different levels, some of which can be reached via elevators, staircases, and an escalator. Exiting the building and approaching some of the destinations through exterior routes was also an option in some cases. The sequence of destination was designed such that a single one-way route to cover all destinations was not a possibility. The first origin point was approximately a mile away from the hospital, inside a mall. The last destination point was the hospital parking lot in which the subject was parked. The destinations Subjects, Sample, and Recruitment Two types of subjects were recruited for the study, namely, (1) volunteering healthy adults to simulate visitors and (2) volunteering hospital employees. In the case of simulated visitors, considering the exploratory nature of the study, a total sample size of 10 adults were targeted. Solicitation fliers were posted in churches, community halls, and grocery stores. In addition, general e-mail solicitation was sent to all employees and students at two professional institutions. There were three exclusion criteria for simulated visitors, namely, (1) the subjectmustnot havevisited orhavebeenanemployee atthehospitalin thepast; (2) the subject mustnot be a design professional or student, such as architect, interior designer, engineer, and so on; and (3) the subject must have normal eye sight for their age. A purposive quota sampling strategy was adopted for the study. Two types of quota were targeted. One was age-group. The study targeted two subjects in the age-groups of 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60 and above. Within each age-group, one subject was targeted to be male and the other female. Subjects were recruited on Table 1. Origins and Destinations Used in the Study.

There was no predetermined selection strategy for hospital employees. They were selected onsite at random by a research assistant. Other than visual identification of the employee by a hospital ID card or badge, there were no inclusion or exclusion criteria for recruitment of employees. One hospital employee was randomly approached at each origin point, only for those origins located inside the hospital. A total of eight hospital employees took part in the study. Data Types and Instruments Simulated visitors. Three types of data were collected from simulated visitors. The first type of data involved verbal protocol. Subjects were given a destination at each sequential origin and asked to find their way. However, they were instructed to speak aloud (or think aloud) every thought occurring in their cognitive process. To prime the sub- jects, they were asked to imagine that one of their family members or relatives is currently a patient in the hospital and they need to perform certain tasks with the minimal expenditure of time. A research assistant accompanied the subject close by at all times, one of whose tasks was to continuously remind the subject to think aloud. The subjects were instructed to approach volunteers for help only if they feel that they are com- pletely lost and only as a last resort. Their task was to navigate all the 11 routes by using environmental cues alone. At no point in the process did the study staff offer or provide help to the subject. Two additional research assistants followed the subject. One assistant took photographs of physical elements that the subject pointed out during navigation as things aiding or hindering navigation. The third assistant captured the subject’s path on a set of pdf floor plans of the three buildings. At the conclusion of navigating the 11 routes, the subjects were administered a survey. The survey asked a short list of simple factual questions regarding their navigation experience in the hospital. The survey was expected to provide trian- gulation data for those generated through verbal protocol. Verbal protocol data were recorded using digital audio recorders. A digital camera was used for capturing photographs. Employees. Only one type of data was collected from the employees. At each origin point one employee was asked to provide verbal direction to the next destination (as outlined in Table 1). The verbal directions were captured using digital audio recorder. Data Collection Simulated visitors. On the day of data collection, subjects’ simulating visitors were instructed to arrive at a predetermined time to a mall parking lot, about a mile from the hospital. On arrival they were given a description of the study, the task she or he was expected to perform and their rights as human subjects. Questions posed by the subjects, if any, were then responded to, and the informed consent form was administered. Subsequently, the subject was fitted with a digital audio recorder and then taken as a passenger to the site. She or he started giving verbal directions and thinking aloud (verbal protocol) from the mall parking lot. From that point onward, she or he was provided standardized oral instructions to proceed to the next predetermined destination, one at a time, until she or he reached the last destination. The last task involved filling out the survey. The subject was subsequently dropped back in the mall parking lot. The entire process took between 2 and 3 hrs. Employees. A study staff randomly selected an employee at each of the origin points located inside the hospital. The employee was provided with a verbal description of the study and was inquired regarding his or her interest in voluntary participation. On gaining approval, an informed consent form was administered. Subsequently, the employee was asked to provide verbal directions to the next destination on the list of routes. The total time with each employee was between 5 and 10 mins. Data Preparation and Analysis Audio-recorded data from the 10 simulated visitors and 8 employees were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcriptionist. The transcripts were subsequently examined through content analysis. Microsoft Excel program was used for capturing data from the content analysis, in a series of separate worksheets. Coding the data involved two parallel strategies. In the first strategy, theories and frameworks from wayfinding in exterior environments were used as classifiers. The second strategy adopted a grounded theory approach, which included memoing and pattern identification. Memoing is a term used by qualitative research to describe the note taking done when first passing over considerable data to begin to look for patterns. The following questions constituted the primary drivers of the coding, memo- ing, and pattern identification tasks: 1. Are subjects actively or passively seeking information from the physical environment? If so, what environmental elements or attributes are being used? 2. Are there evidences related to the five wayfinding factors articulated by Huelat (2007)? 3. Are there indications on the subjects’ use of environmental information in some form of cognitive map? Is meaningful route knowledge being created? Are subjects creating some form of survey knowledge? Are there meaningful counterparts of the five elements (Lynch, 1960)—path, edge, district, node, and landmark—in building interiors? 4. Do employees use environmental information while providing directions? The final sets of coding involved three clusters, namely, (1) those related to Huelat’s (2007) five factors, (2) those related to individual physical designattributes and elements,and (3)those related to cognitive maps. Chunks of data relevant to more than one coding cluster were coded and captured for each qualifying cluster separately (in duplication). The same type of coding was performed for audio recordings of employees’ verbal directions. The coding and data representation on Excel worksheets were done separately and individually for each subject and for each route. Time stamp from digital photographs and path/route maps was cross checked and individual images were linked to each subject’s verbal recording. Data from the paper survey were transferred to an Excel worksheet. The worksheets were subsequently rendered ready for quantitative analysis. The clusters and classification resulting from the coding phase, along with definitions, are listed in Table 2 (subclasses are not included but described in subsequent sections). This table also provides examples of subjects’ verbal exposition for each coding category. Since some of the coding classes entailed subjective judgments, coded data were reviewed by more than one member of the research team to ensure that expositions were classified meaningfully and accurately. Numerical frequency data were captured for each instance of occurrence, within each category, separately for each subject and each route. Table 2. Clusters and Coding Categories From Subject’s Verbal Protocol. Cluster Coding Categories Definition Huelat’s (2007) five wayfinding factors Environmental cues (elements and attributes) Where am I?

Data from employees and surveys were analyzed using similar descriptive statistics and compared with quantitative analyses of the audio transcripts of simulated visitors. Quantitative analyses were guided by the three research questions. The following questions were asked of the quantitative data: 1. What aspects of the physical environment 3. What role do physical environment elements and attributes in health care facilities play in the wayfinding process? Examination of this question was conducted by calculating percentage of total for the frequency data in each individual category when compared to the total in each cluster. The clusters used here included ‘‘Huelat’s (2007) five wayfinding factors’’ and cognitive mapping. aid in wayfinding decision making for visitors? g g pp g This question was examined as part of the coding exercise. 2. How do the various wayfinding strategies compare in frequency of use for visitors? Examination of this question was conducted by calculating ‘‘percentage of total’’ for the frequency data in each individual category when compared to the total in each cluster. The cluster used was ‘‘environmental cues (elements and attributes).’’ Findings Aspects of the Physical Environment Contributing to Wayfinding A large variety of elements and attributes of the physical environment were identified in the data as contributing to wayfinding. The nature and frequency of support, however, vary considerably. Those include (1) maps, (2) signs, (3) logical clustering of functions, (4) furniture, (5) logical pairing of interior architecture elements, (6) structural elements (7) architectural features, and (8) other design elements. The ‘‘other design elements’’ include a large variety of things that interior designers procure or design and incorporate in building interiors. The specific elements found to be contributing to wayfinding, in this study, include (1) artwork, (2) fixed furnitureandmillwork,(3) displayboardsandinformation panels,(4) wall color, (5)vending machines, and (6) indoor plants. Following are brief descriptions of the elements and attributes identified. Maps. Maps, in this study, stand for diagrammatic, two-dimensional representation of the global environment. Maps on the study site primarily showed major departments, names of key program areas, hallways and corridors, and location of vertical circulation. Subjects frequently used maps for navigational information. Their most frequent focus was on hallways, vertical circulation nodes, and departmental boundaries. An observation worth noting was that subjects expected the exact name of their destination on the map. Furthermore, subjects expected a uniform pattern of map locations. For instance, if the first map they encounter was located in the elevator lobby, they expected a map every time they came across an elevator lobby. Figure 2 shows the two most common locations for maps when sought by the subjects—counter tops of the information desks in the lobbies of different hospital buildings and in the elevator lobbies. The following quote is an example of verbal protocol demonstrating the use of maps for navigational information: Here are what appear to be cashier stations and I saw those on the map so I thought that this long hallway here was near where the cafeteria would be and I see here now a sign that points me toward Cafeteria so I think I should go that way. Signs. Signs, in this study, stand for alphanumeric and symbolic declarations of programmatic spaces, directions, and routes. Those include room or space names and labels, directional signs, and images, logos, or symbols suggesting programmatic use. Signs constituted one of the first types of information sought by subjects. Each minute aspect of labels, space names, numbers, and arrow directions (in directional signs) were intricately examined by the subjects in order to derive useful and logical navigational information. Data suggest some noteworthy observations. First, in sign boards showing multiple destinations, subjects expected the destinations to appear in the same order as shown on the sign board. Further, similar to maps, subjects expected some pattern in the location and orientation of signs, based on their first encounter with a type of sign. Figure 3 shows the different types of signs displayed in the hospital. The following verbal protocol exemplifies the use of signs for navigational aid: Well, I am looking for Patient Room H403 I believe you said, but I am not seeing something that says Patient Rooms. Functional clusters. Functional clusters are defined as logical clustering of programmatic spaces with (sometimes) mutually supportive or complementary functions. Examples of such clusters include proximal location of cafeteria and lobby, main entrance and admissions, and adult waiting and children’s play area, among others. Figure 4a illustrates the proximity of a children’s play area to an adult waiting area. The actual waiting area (not visible here) is located on the other side of the escalator shaft. The following verbal protocol is the example of the way functional clusters were used as information sources: Everything is usually on the first floor Lobby area, food, you know, souvenirs or presents. The gift shop is usually on the same floor. Furniture. Furniture is defined as large movable equipment and associated accessories procured or designed by interior designers. It includes tables, chairs, sofas, and so forth. Subjects drew logical conclusions from the type of furniture they encountered in their field of vision. For instance, they asso- ciated the presence of seats with waiting area, located far away in the visual field to be able to read signs and labels. Figure 4b is a view of a waiting area when walking toward the imaging department. The sight of the chairs, occupied or not, indicated that this was a waiting area. No signs were visible from here. The following verbal protocol exemplifies the use of information from furniture: Figure 2. (a) Maps on counter tops of information desk in lobby. (b) Map in elevator lobby. Figure 3. Signs displayed in different parts of the hospital. Well I kind of see like something waiting down there . . . yes, I see like a lot of chairs and stuff . . . . Interior element pairing. Element pairing refers to logical pairing of interior architecture elements (excluding furniture), with associated functions. For instance, interior windows (Figure 4c) with counters were associated with admissions. The following verbal protocol shows an example of information derived from pairing (accurate or not): I am looking at that window over there. I don’t know what that is. I thought maybe it was something to do with Admissions. Structural elements. Structural elements are defined as physical elements designed by structural engineers. Examples include structural Figure 4. (a) Children’s play area in an adult waiting area; (b) chairs, sofas, and couches, whether occupied or not, were indicative of a waiting area, even from a distance; (c) the ‘‘after hours’’ window of the pharmacy which a subject thought to be the admission area; (d) the columns that separated the working areas of medical records employees were mistaken from a distance to be elevator banks. columns, beams, and so on. Subjects indulged in intelligent guesswork when they encountered with certain structure–function phenotypes. For instance, the presence of a series of deep columns was associated with elevator bank, although that was not the case, as illustrated in Figure 4d. The following verbal protocol provides an example: That appears to be maybe a bank of elevators there . . . I thought it was but I see now that it does not appear to be. Architectural features. Architectural features are defined as attributes of physical environment designed by architects or interior designers. Archi- tectural features included two types of attributes. One pertained to view of exterior spaces from the interiors. The second pertained to multilevel interior views afforded by atriums. In addition, directional signs posted in exterior spaces were picked up by subjects as informational cues to help navigate in interior environ- ments. The following verbal quote provides an example of the use of such information: Yes and there is Professional Building 3, which makes me think that this is Professional Building 1. Other design elements. This category includes things in the physical environment procured or designed by interior designers but provided a different type of information to the subjects. Although many of the elements in this category will seem to have apparent overlap with other categories articulated earlier, the fundamental difference is that subjects used elements listed in this category purely as familiarity markers and not as active navigational aids. The subtle distinction between familiarity markers and naviga- tional aid (albeit, perhaps, not less important in any manner) is articulated in detail in the discussion section. Interior elements identified in the data, belonging to this category, include (1) pieces of artwork, specifically paintings, sculptures, and piano; (2) fixed furniture and millwork, specifically information desk and cashier station; (3) display board and information panels, specifically, glass panel displaying names of donors, surgery information screen, electronic board with nonnavigational information, and a plaque with historical information; (4) wall color; and (5) vending machines. It is noteworthy that in case of paintings, the subjects did not capture the content of the artwork. They simply captured the existence of the artwork at a location. In addition, information desks were pointed out by subjects, whether occupied or not. Furthermore, display boards with information irrelevant to navigation were, nevertheless, found to be useful by the subjects. These other design elements are illustrated in Figure 5. Two other elements—indoor plants and fire extinguishers—were used only once as familiarity markersandhencewereexcludedfromthedataanalysis. The following verbal protocol data are exam- ples of use of this type of environmental elements: The patient floor that we were on however was a completely different color, completely different tone. Everything about it was totally different. I would know that if I go there again. And I see Information desk so I know that (the destination) is not going to be it right there. I remember coming in from here because of the artwork which actually helps me stimulate my memory because it is different and it is an individual. That’s the hard part I have had with other hospitals is the fact that everything looks the same. My guess is it (the destination) is right there . . . by that television board that we just passed by that we were looking at. Comparison of Frequency of Use How frequently did the subjects use the variety of environmental information identified in the previous section for active navigation or developing familiarity? Proportion and percentage data were calculated within the‘‘environmental cues’’ cluster. Table 3 presents example text chunks within each type of coding category. It should be noted that environmental information in the ‘‘other design elements’’ category were used in a different way by the subjects (for familiarity develop- ment) in comparison to the remaining classifications (which were used as information for active navigation). Table 4 presents the percentage of times different types of environmental information were sought by the subjects. Table 5 presents the distribution in the other design elements category. A few notable observations can be made in Tables 3 and 4. Signs constitute the most frequent environmental information sought by subjects— substantially more than the other classes of information. Four classes of environmental information—signs, architectural features, maps, and other design elements—covered 95% of the occasions when environmental information were sought by subjects. Among other design elements, artworks were associated with the highest Figure 5. Other design elements.

Three types of other design elements—artwork, display boards and information panels, and fixed furniture and millwork—together accounted for 90% of the environmental information use. Role of Physical Environment Elements and Attributes in the Wayfinding Phenomena What role do physical environment elements and attributes in health care facilities play in the Table 3. Examples of Text Chunks Coded in Different Categories of Environmental Information. Environmental Information Category Subcategory Example Quote Maps I will go look the first floor map again and see if it gives me any clues I was also checking to see how close we were to the next Information desk because there might be a map up there No I didn’t see a map set up similar to the one that is upstairs Signs I like having the sign on the side. If they just had the sign on the top I could cruise right past there and never notice that it was Admissions And right off the escalator I see a sign that says Chapel with an arrow straight ahead and I am going to follow that So this goes Cafeteria, Coffee Shop, Cashier, Chapel. So if there was any kind of justice in the world when we go down here we’d find them in that order Functional clusters Everything is usually on the first floor Lobby area, food, you know, souvenirs or presents. The gift shop is usually on the same floor Areas away from the Main building is more medical things. I don’t think there is coffee there Obviously here is Admissions and here is ATM, here is Restrooms. All of those things are normally in a kind of central location maybe near the lobby and an area where perhaps you would be headed toward patient rooms. Cashier’s Department. This appears to be the Cashier’s Department. That would lead me to believe I am near check-in Furniture I kind of see like something waiting down there but I am not sure if it is for the Surgery.

I thought it was but I see now that it does not appear to be Since I saw so many people waiting down there that’s what I kind of think is the Surgery Lounge There is a wide space there that could be some sort of, or perhaps, it is still down another level because all those people were sitting down there that it is possible they were waiting for imaging Artwork I remember the pictures on the wall now even though they didn’t mean anything to me I remember that pretty art at the end of the hallway too I remember coming in from here because of the artwork which actually helps me stimulate my memory because it is different and it is an individual.

The comparative frequencies of each of these themes, as counted from audio transcript data, are presented in Table 7. Data suggest that almost two thirds of the time subjects were seeking environmental information associated with the wayfinding questions of the location of the destination and the way to navigate to the destination. Using environmental information for comprehension of current location was the third most frequent sought cue. Two new phenomena were observed during navigation. Although ‘‘where a person is’’ is typically associated with a person’s starting location, data suggest that subjects engaged in a ‘‘continuous assessment’’ of their then current situation during the entire process of navigation. According to study data, 66% of the thought process during navigation between sets of origin-destination were devoted to continuous assessment of ‘‘where am I?’’ Example of text chunk that articulates this phenomenon is provided subsequently. Implications of this phenomenon are addressed in the discussion section. I could see the sign (name deleted) at the top so I know that I am, I hope that I am going in the right direction. . . . .and if I am correct that H stands for (name deleted), which may not, hence I would think that maybe I am near patient rooms. We at least do appear to be in patient rooms now and there is 461. Table 4. Comparison of Environmental Information Types Sought by Subjects, From Most to Least Frequent. Percentage Environmental Cues Frequency of Total wayfinding process? This question was examined using two coding clusters. The first pertained to Huelat’s (2007) suggestion that the process involves five questions, namely (1) knowing where he or she is, (2) knowing his or her destination, (3) knowing which route gets him or her to the destination, (4) knowing when he or she has reached the destination, and (5) knowing how to return. Accordingly, the data coding exercise included each of the five themes to examine whether such thought processes exist and if so the comparative frequency of such thought processes. Data suggest that all five thought processes occurred among subjects.

Examples of Text Chunks in Each Thematic Category. Thematic Category Example Text Chunk Where am I? I am just more towards the main part Where to go? I am wondering if it may be that large area two floors down, so my proposal would be to go back After we get off the escalator I am going to go to my left That would probably lead me outside the hospital which is not what I want. So and then here so I see there is another exit-type looking thing so I don’t want to go that way How to go? I guess we can use the escalators So I am going to go up the escalators and then I am going to look at that sign that is up there Did I reach? And then this, that little sign, it is kind of small but it says, Welcome to the Family Surgery Waiting Lounge, so this is the waiting lounge So this sign on the pillar was the one I looked at when I was looking for the Surgical Center so that says the Interventional Center, so that confirms that it is here Returning back? I am going back down the putty-colored hallway . . . my thinking as I am going to some place I always want to know how to get back. So I like to point out things to find my way back I am going to go back the way I came just to be on the safe side. So I am going to turn to my right and I am just going to go back to the Main Lobby . . . We came this way and we came down the escalator so I am going to go back up the escalator Table 7.

They are conference rooms and auditoriums, teaching areas, forum. So this is not what I am looking for. A second phenomenon pertains to the subjects’ prediction regarding the probable visual appearance of the destination. Although it occurred explicitly in only 2.7% of the total occurrences of the five questions in the thematic category discussed in this section, it has potential implicit or indirect association with some of the classes of environmental information discussed in the other coding categories. This phenomenon will be further articulated Thematic Category Frequency Percent of Total Occurrences in the discussion section. Example of text chunk that articulates this phenomenon is provided subsequently.

Wayfinding Phenomenon Frequency Percentage of Total Example Text Chunk Mental map 109 62.40% (Name deleted). Okay, I remember seeing that when we were on the first floor I remember the Chapel is the very first thing on the left when we came in from the lobby so So I think that is kind, kind of far, not far, but I am going to go back down the same hallway because I remember it was not in the main area but it was a floor below with the escalators Familiarity marker 68 37.60% . . . .there should be a help desk here. Oh! Escalators, escalators. We should go to the escalators. . . . Yes, right above the escalators is the sign, surgery lounge I would imagine that Surgery Waiting would be kind of big because I imagine this is where family is. But if it was like a waiting area or a reception area or that kind of thing there would be chairs against the window and it would be a dead giveaway—that’s a place where people wait. Most cafeterias are on the first floor. The second coding cluster examined here is the one pertaining to cognitive mapping. Transcripts of audio data suggest evidence in support of two themes, namely, (1) creation of mental maps and (2) adoption of familiarity markers. Table 8 presents example text chunks as well as frequency statistics on the two concepts. Although prevailing theories provide evidence of people developing mental maps, the phenomenon of adopting familiarity markers in the pro- cess has not been discussed widely. A related phenomenon observed from the data is the use of ‘‘anchor points’’ by the subjects. The term anchor point is coined by the authors and was not used by the subjects. The concept relates to the adoption of a base location (like a mother ship in space) by the subjects, which served as interim point of familiarity and perceived safety as well as major nodes and orientation points in their mental maps. Subjects used such terms to refer to anchor points as ‘‘home base,’’ ‘‘where everything is,’’ ‘‘where I feel safe,’’ ‘‘that’s where I get help,’’ and ‘‘point of reference.’’ In total there are 32 instances of use of anchor points by subjects. On detailed examination of routes subjects followed, anchor points demonstrate some common characteristics, including (1) close to an exterior entrance point (not necessarily the entrance used by the subject), (2) presence of vertical circulation, (3) presence of multiple activities, and (4) presence of maps and directional signs. Even if a specific anchor point had not been very effective in offering adequate help in locating their destinations, subjects still sought to return to these anchor points to orient themselves. A key concept from literature—landmarks— only rarely surfaced in the audio transcripts as a word. However, data suggest multiple uses of landmarks and varying elements serving as landmarks. Furthermore, landmarks were closely linked to the concept of familiarity markers. What are the implications of anchor points? What purpose do familiarity markers serve? What elements do people use to create familiarity markers? These issues are addressed in the discussion section. Environmental Information Use in Employee Direction–Giving Behavior Most of the verbal directions provided by employees involved architectural features (hallways, lobby area) at 67.6% of total reference to environmental elements and attributes. It was followed by directional signs (8.8%) and space labels (2.4%) both falling under the ‘‘signs’’ classification. Following is an example quote of instances of use of physical design cues by employees. You come around our radiology front desk and head down the hallway to the orange chairs. You take a right at the orange chairs, okay? Follow that hallway to the elevator, which will be on your right. Take the elevator to the first floor and you should see the Chapel. Results of Paper Survey Two findings from data analysis of the survey are of relevance. The first involved the response to a question ‘‘On a scale of 0–5, to what degree did the following help you in locating your destination today?’’ The line items included (1) ‘‘follow- ing signs and directions,’’ (2) asking people for help, (3) ‘‘following landmarks,’’ (4) ‘‘following instinct,’’ and (5) using a facility map. Table 9 presents the mean ranking obtained from data analysis. A second survey question of relevance is ‘‘along the route to your destination, are there any landmarks (distinctive features in the environment such as artwork, colors, stairs, elevators, and so forth) that you remembered particularly, which may help you find your way next time?’’ Table 10 lists the landmarks self-reported by subjects. Discussion Environmental Information Sought by Subjects Study data suggest several useful information from practical as well as theoretical perspectives. The first issue of relevance is the kind of information sought by subjects during navigation. Data demonstrate that a wide range of environmental elements and attributes were used by subjects to navigate on the assigned routes, ranging from signs and architectural features to artwork. One key question of interest pertains to the elements Table 9. Mean Ranking (Highest to Lowest) of Navigational Aid Self-Reported by Subjects in the Survey.

Landmarks Self-Reported by Subjects as Helpful Information, in the Survey. Frequency of Appearance in Survey Landmark Response and attributes most frequently used by subjects. According to the study, data signs constitute the leader among all classes of environmental information, covering 71% of the number of times subjects sought information. Signs include space or room labels, numbers, directional signs, sign boards listing multiple destinations, and images and logos symbolizing certain functions. Based on study data, the environmental cues listed in Table 4 can be clubbed into three broader categories. The first broad category includes signs, architectural features, and maps. The authors would like to term this category ‘‘primary navigational information.’’ The second broad category includes functional clusters, interior element pairing, structural elements, and furniture. The authors would like to term this category ‘‘supporting navigational information.’’ The last broad category includes other design elements—which is itself an aggregate class including five subclasses of interior elements. The authors would like to term this cate- gory ‘‘mapping information.’’ Primary navigational information. Environmental elements and attributes in the primary navigational information category provided the global navigational information, as in ‘‘survey knowledge’’ suggested in literature. It creates the initial skeleton of the global environment in which the Architectural features (atrium, escalator, elevator, sky bridge, etc.) 6 Artwork (painting, artwork around a column, etc.) 4 Signs (including subway logo, bold signage, etc.) 3 Other spaces (main lobby, lobby, patient tower lobby, etc.) 3 Fixed furniture and millwork (desk, admission desk, etc.) 2 Furniture (waiting area chairs, etc.) 2 Functional clusters (coffee shop) 1 subjects navigated. It provided the basic, utilitarian, foundation of a cognitive map but lacking any rich contextual information. In terms of frequency of use the three elements or attributes, together, accounted for almost 90% of instances in which environmental information was sought by the subjects. This was corroborated in the subjects’ survey response, which after ‘‘following instinct’’ and following signs and directions obtained the highest mean rank to a question on the degree of help it provided in locating their destination. ‘‘Expanded visual access’’ was not part of the survey question. ‘‘Using facility map’’ showed up as the feature providing the least degree of help. The reason perhaps reflects on the quality of the maps as opposed to the frequency of use of maps (which was third highest). As noted earlier, subjects were expecting the exact name of their destination on the maps. It is possible that maps were not found to be helpful, despite the subjects’ frequent use of it for navigational information. It is noteworthy that none of the maps designed as navigation aid identified where the subject was (as in ‘‘You-AreHere’’). That may have contributed primarily to the low ratings of maps by subjects. These element or attribute types associated with primary navigational information are meaningful and intuitive. Signs and maps, by defini- tion, provide the most vital information for navigation to a destination. Architectural features, in this study defined as visual access to exterior environments along with multilevel interior environments, in essence vastly expanded the visual field of subjects, thereby providing crucial information regarding horizontal and vertical circulation systems as well as external clues (via exterior signs) to possible internal routes to targeted destinations. Signs were the very first information sought by subjects. It was only preceded by a time window (sometime considerable) that involved the subjects’ critical assessment of whether the name of the destination provides any clue regarding the type of sign to look for. From that perspective, alphanumeric nomenclature for destinations also constitutes a type of sign. Thus, the subjects’ cognitiveprocessisactivatedwiththequestionpertaining to the meaning of the name of a destination and the appropriate sign type to seek to reach that destination.Thisiterative processofseekingmeaningfrom a name or alphanumeric nomenclature, and subsequently seeking out appropriate signs, was repeated at each of the 11 origin points. Data point to cognitive processes that were involved in developing a global-level understanding of the three buildings and intra-/interbuilding circulation linkages. Supporting navigational information. Environmental elements and attributes in the supporting navigational information category played a different type of role in the cognitive process. Data suggest that subjects may be engaging in a process of developing a visual prediction of the destination and spaces along the destination. These may be originating from their long-term memory of similar spaces in other buildings. The authors would like to term this phenomenon as ‘‘destination features prediction’’ where destinations include the final as well as all interim destinations. As a result, subjects were continuously matching what they expect (images from memory) to what they see—although their prediction was not accurate all the time. When subjects expected the cafeteria to be collocated with the main lobby, or the admissions to be proximal to the main entrance, and they found it to be true, it acted as confirmatory supporting information—that they are probably at the right destination or following the right direction. Comparing expected visual features with actual ones constituted the initial cognitive process, which was invariably followed by final confirmation from signs and nomenclature. Similar other instances include expecting comfortable sofas in waiting areas, windows with pass-through counters at admissions (which was not true), and deep columns (or architectural wall elements) suggesting elevator bank (which was not true), among others. Functional clusters, interior element pairing, structural elements, and furniture are the four sources of information associated with supporting destination features prediction. The process of destination features prediction can also be viewed as a ‘‘continuous—where I am—assessment.’’ As subjects developed skeletal cognitive maps based on signs, architectural features, and maps, it appears from data that they also developed provisional (expected) mental images of interim and final destinations. As they navigated using the skeletal cognitive map, it appears that they were continuously assessing their location at any point in time (where am I) with the expected visual features, and further confirming with information from signs. As a result, it may be asserted (pending confirmation through further research) that initial cog- nitive maps are rarely purely skeletal in nature. People attach semirich contextual information to skeletal maps (based purely on initial information from signs, expanded visual field, and maps) with expected visual features from long-term memory. As people encounter actual environments during navigation, they perhaps replace their mental representations based on long-term memory with richer and truer contextual information from the immediate environment. When a mismatch between expected and actual environmental features occurs, those locations, interest- ingly, served as landmarks for subjects. But, what are landmarks? That warrants discussion on the third type of broad environmental cue category—mapping information. Mapping information. What roles do other interior design elements play in wayfinding? Shouldn’t the primary and supporting navigational information be sufficient for people to navigate in building interiors? Are there any justifications for capital expenditure on the other interior elements? Data suggest that subjects meaningfully and frequently used infor- mation offered by elements in the other design elements category of environmental cues. This study identified five classes of other design elements that provided useful information—artwork, display boards and information panels, fixed furniture and millwork, wall color, and vending machines. Discussions on other design elements should ideally occur within the concept of anchor points introduced previously. To comprehend the concept of anchor points, it is best to imagine oneself in the woods or in the outer space. While navigating in such environments, it is common for people to create safe spots to which that they can return. In outer space, it is the mother ship. In the woods, it is often a clearing or perhaps a base camp. It must be noted that all subjects were totally unfamiliar with the hospital where the study was conducted and had never visited the facility in the past. They were in unfamiliar territory. As subjects begun developing skeletal maps using infor- mation from signs, visual field, and maps, and populating those maps with provisional expected visual features of yet unseen and unknown destinations (interim and final), perhaps, the first instinct was to locate a safe spot (a base camp or a series of base camps or mother ships). Study data strongly suggest the phenomena of identifying anchor points. Anchor points, as previously articulated, had several common attributes— close to an external entrance point (not necessarily the entrance used by the subject), proximal location of vertical circulation, multiple activities, presence of people, and presence of maps and signs. As subjects navigated beyond these anchor points, they tended to select and pick elements in the visual environment as familiarity markers. The process is akin to leaving pebbles on one’s path in the woods or rather using any element that sticks to one’s memory like bread crumbs along the path. This phenomenon is pertinent to the concept of landmarks. While, traditionally, landmarks are considered as visually dominating objects, study data show that a wide variety of elements (including those visually dominating) being used as landmarks or familiarity markers. This phenomenon is corroborated in the survey data. Data show that familiarity markers were actively used by subjects whenever they traversed the same path more than 1 time. This phenomenon can also be viewed as a part of the continuous assessment of ‘‘where I am.’’ Moreover, familiarity markers perhaps constitute the contextual information, which were added continuously to the skeletal survey map to develop rich route map information described in the introduction. Elements in the other design elements category of environmental cues were the ones used as familiarity markers or landmarks by the subjects of this study. The importance of this class of information is reflected in the frequency of information seeking (Table 4) where it ranks immediately after the broad category of primary navigational information. It is corroborated in the survey data (Table 9) where following landmarks was rated immediately after ‘‘following signs and directions’’ as the information source that afforded the highest degree of help to the subjects. Among the other design elements group of elements, artwork (paintings, sculptures, and a piano) constituted the most frequent information source to be used as familiarity markers or as landmarks. Finally, in comparison to studies in other settings, wayfinding studies in hospitals should be viewed as a special case. It is because, unlike other settings, people do not visit hospitals regularly and when they do they are generally at a high level of stress and anxiety. Study Limitations Five areas of limitations are evident. First, the subjects were generally from an educated middle-class background. That leaves a considerable proportion of patient or visitor population out of the analysis. The second area of limitation pertains to using simulated visitors as opposed to actual visitors. It may be asserted that real visitors would experience higher levels of acute stress and anxiety and may behave somewhat differently from the observed behavior in this study. This is despite the investigators’ attempt to induce some level of stress by creating a hypothetical scenario (priming) for the subjects. The third limitation pertains to obtaining the subject’s review of the audio transcript. Since the transcripts contained verbal protocol as opposed to interviews, which were transcribed verbatim, there was no reason to believe that the subjects would disagree with the transcription. The subject, however, could have provided some insight into what they were truly thinking at some point in time. It may be argued that since the transcripts captured their ongoing thought processes, the subjects themselves may offer interpretations that are different from what they were thinking at that point in time, if they do actually manage to remember. The cross checking of interpretations primarily occurred among the investigators. Fourth, although the sample size for simulated patients and visitors was appropriate for a qualitative, exploratory study, the sample size for employ- ees could havebeenlarger.That mayhaveprovided some additional confidence into the kinds of environmental information employee’s use while pro- viding direction. Finally, the study was conducted in one hospital. Multisite studies would have provided greater credence to study findings by virtue of a larger sampling under a more broad set of circumstances. Future Efforts This research opens up a series of questions for examination in future studies. The first pertains to subjects. The subject profile could be expanded to include people with other levels of education and income, people not proficient in English as well as using actual patients and visitors as opposed to simulated ones. Furthermore, repetition of the study in multiple health care facilities will enable identification of common themes and provide greater credibility to the findings. An associated issue not examined pertains to wayfinding challenges encountered by the staff. Perhaps, typically, it is assumed that health care staffs do not encounter wayfinding challenges since unfamiliarity with the facility should not be an issue for them (other than the initial few days for a new employee). However, in the context of health care in the United States, in both the public and private sector, it is customary to hire short-term rotating or float nurses (sometimes called agency nurses). These nurses may not be familiar with the physical facility and may experience the same level of disorientation as visitors and family members of patients. Improper wayfinding could affect staff response time in getting special medications, getting equipment, and similar issues as a result affecting efficiency, safety, or both, depending on the nature of staff trip. The type of information sought by staff for wayfinding may or may not be different from those sought by patients’ family members and visitors; which is impossible to ascertain without empirical data. Furthermore, several concepts and phenomenon of theoretical and practical importance emerged in this study that warrant further examination include (1) continuous where I am evaluation by subjects, (2) destination feature prediction, (3) creation and use of anchor points, and (4) familiarity markers as landmarks and the expanded definition of landmark for wayfinding in building interiors. Finally, a crucial question pertains to ‘‘importance.’’ There are conceptual differences between ‘‘frequency of use,’’ ‘‘usefulness,’’ and importance among the various sources of environmental information. The present study question did not include examination of importance—for instance, identifying the ‘‘aha’’ moments leading to leaps in clarity pertaining to navigation. Future studies need to extend the current study to examine this vital question. Ideally importance should drive capital investment, for which this study creates the necessary foundation. Conclusion A wide range of environmental elements and attributes provide information during navigation. Those include signs, architectural features expanding visual fields, maps, interior elements (artwork, display boards, information counters, and so forth), predictable functional clusters, predictable pairing of interior elements, structural elements, and furniture, among others. The information is used in different ways. Signs, architectural features, and maps are used as primary navigational information. Functional clusters, interior element pairing, structural elements, and furniture are used as supporting navigational information. Other interior design elements play the vital role of familiar- ity markers. Signs, architectural features that expand visual fields, maps, predictable functional clusters, and artwork constitute the five most frequently used environmental elements for informa- tion during navigation, in that order. Architectural feature is the top contributor in the domain of architecture. Artwork (painting, sculpture, piano, and so forth) is the top contributor in the domain of interior design, according to study data. Implications for Practice 1. Alphanumeric labeling system. A. Data show that the very first cognitive process, where subjects spent substantial amount of time, is in attempting to find meaning in the label itself. Since labeling systems fall beyond the purview of the design profession, it is imperative that professionals be engaged in developing and testing labeling and number- ing system for buildings, floors, rooms, and other program areas. B. Labeling systems get distorted over time as new buildings are added to an existing hospital. While developing a labeling and numbering plan, focus on devising systems that will retain its meaning over the long run, as the facility expands and new buildings are added. C. Data suggest that incorporating building name or number, floor name or number, and room name or number in a labeling system provides useful clue to subjects. D. These findings are only those observed in this one study. Consultants must survey published literature on designing labeling systems for developing a comprehen- sive plan. 2. Signs. A. Signs constitute the most frequently sought environmental information. Since signs are typically not within the purview of the design profession, it is imperative to engage specialist consultants for developing signage system. B. In some instances, subjects got confused with directional signs that ended up with another directional sign to the same destination but in the opposite direction. Test the signage system to ensure that directional signs do not lead to dead ends and accurately point to the destination. C. Be careful with up/down arrows. Those could be interpreted differently as forward/backward or upward/downward, depending on the subject. D. Subjects interpret left and right side placement of arrows on a single board dif- ferently. Ensure that placement of directional arrows on a single sign are meaningful, clear, and not likely to be misinterpreted. E. Subjects expect a pattern in signage location. Be consistent in where signs are located. F. Be aware of the wayfinding implication associated with a series of laterally deep column wraps or architectural features. Such architectural elements block line of sight to signs that are meant to be viewed at a distance. G. These findings are only those observed in this one study. Consultants must survey published literature on designing signage systems for developing a comprehensive plan. 3. Sign or information boards. Sign or information boards are boards or electronic screens that show directions to multiple destinations. Subjects assume that the order of progression of destinations shown on the boards is reflected in actual placement of destinations. Ensure a match between the order of progression on sign boards and the actual sequential appearance of destinations. 4. Maps. A. Subjects expect to see the actual name of their destination on the map. While including all destinations on a single map may not be feasible be as inclusive as possible. B. Ensure that all maps show the location of the person viewing it. C. Subjects expect some pattern in map locations. For instance, if their first encounter with a map occurs in an elevator lobby, they expect all elevator lobbies to have maps. Develop a consistent and predictable plan for map locations. D. There is a large body of literature on you-are-here maps. Consultants should refer to those in addition to these findings. 5. Space programming and planning. A. Proximity, adjacencies, visual, and physical access are typical considerations in space planning. In addition to these, program areas with mutually supporting functions or complementary functions maybecollocated.Subjectspredictdestinations based on logical clustering of functions. B. Initiate this procedure, from a patient or visitor perspective, starting with the major entrances and subsequently follow through to the rest of the public areas or public–clinical space interface locations. 6. Movable furniture. A. Subjects develop expectations regarding furniture type based on the destination. Choose or design movable furniture that reinforces the phenotype of a destination. 7. Interior architecture and structural elements. A. Subjects engage in predicting and matching elements of interior architecture and subtle implications of struc- tural patterns with program areas or subfunctions. Make the optimal use of such cognitive matching. 8. Architectural feature—visual field. A. Subjects make optimum use of expanded visual field for obtaining primary navigational information. The fre- quency of such use in this study is only second to the use of signs. B. Optimize size and location of exterior windows to expand visual field beyond the typical limits in building interiors. C. Locate exterior signs and directions strategically to afford visibility from inter- iors and inform interior wayfinding. D. When multilevel atrium spaces are included in a project, design and locate such spaces to maximize visual fields from the expected starting points of visitors and patients. Enhance such expanded visual field with proximal location of major signs, maps, and vertical circulation. Create direct lines of sight to important destinations and major hallways and vertical circulation cores on all levels. 9. Anchor points. A. Depending on the size of a facility, design multiple anchor points where appropriate. B. Make optimal use of atrium spaces to create anchor points—there are strong synergetic relationships between the two. C. ‘‘Nodes’’ or the crossing of major public hallways offers ideal locations for creating anchor points. Whenever feasible, use such nodes for designing cogni- tive anchors. D. Locate anchor points close to major entrances and vertical circulation for best performance. Incorporate multiple activities and logical clustering of program areas—anchor points and logical clustering of program areas bear a synergetic relationship. Ensure large number of people presences—especially uniformed staff. Strategically locate maps and signs for best identification from a distance. E. In case of multiple anchor points, locate anchor points within reasonable proximities. Maintaining direct line of sight between anchor points is optimal. If that is not feasible, reduce cognitive confusion by maintaining relatively orthogonal hallway configurations and reducing intersection of major hallways between anchor points. F. Create unique perceptual characteristics (visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory) for each anchor points. 10. Familiarity markers. A. Familiarity markers play a crucial role in navigation, including creation of anchor points. Be strategic in the use of artwork, fixed furniture, and millwork such as information or reception counters, display boards and information panels, and colors. Ideally, these can be used to provide perceptual differentiations between major public hallways. B. Environments with higher complexity (familiarity markers, people, and activities) tend to aid more in developing familiarity. 11. Budget optimization. Pending further studies to develop greater level of corroboration of study findings, budgetary allocation may be ordered according to the frequency of use of environmental elements and attributes found in this study. The top five elements and attributes are (1) signs, (2) architec- tural features that expand visual field, (3) maps, (4) predictable functional clusters, and (5) artwork, in that order. Architectural feature is the top consideration in the domain of architecture. Artwork (painting, sculpture, piano, etc.) is the top consideration in the domain of interior design, according to study data.      Previous research indicates that the built environment has a fundamental eﬀect on people, and that design can aﬀect people’s mental health (e.g. moods) (Clements-Croome 2005). Designing buildings that are beneﬁcial for physical and mental health and well-being is therefore a relevant goal for architects and interior designers. The relationship between built environments and health is, however, a complex issue that involves a large number of diﬀerent factors, some of which are physical and others which are psychological. Over the past decade an increasing number of solid empirical studies have documented that experiences of nature can be beneﬁcial for human health and wellbeing (Health Council of the Netherlands 2004). One set of psychological beneﬁts of nature that has received much attention in research involves aesthetic or aﬀective responses. According to Ulrich (1983), viewing a setting with natural elements can elicit a response of aesthetic liking, which, in turn, leads to more positive feelings. Several studies have indicated that people in general prefer natural scenes dominated by vegetation to urban scenes lacking vegetation (Kaplan, Kaplan, and Wendt 1972; Zube and Anderson 1975; Knopf 1987). Indoor settings containing natural elements have also been evaluated as more positive (Bringslimark, Hartig, and Patil 2009). Findings from several studies suggest that simply looking at nature, as compared to built scenes where nature is absent, is signiﬁcantly more eﬀective in promoting ∗Corresponding author.

Stress-reducing eﬀects have been found when viewing videotapes of nature versus videotapes of urban scenes (Ulrich et al. 1991; Parsons et al. 1998; Laumann, Gärling, and Stormark 2003), and when looking at trees and vegetation out of a window versus not having a window view (Hartig et al. 2003). With regard to indoor settings, several studies have reported a decrease in stress responses when indoor plants were present as opposed to absent (Bringslimark, Hartig, and Patil 2009). With increasing urbanization, people have less access to nature in their daily life. In Western societies, people spend most of their time in indoor settings. Integrating features of nature into the built environment can therefore give people the possibility of experiencing and interacting with nature to a larger degree than what they experience today. Results from preference studies and other relevant research provide evidence that architects and interior designers can use to promote health and well being in a wide range of built environments through the inclusion of natural elements. This study focuses on the eﬀects of natural elements, particularly wood, in a hospital environment. Use of natural building materials, such as wood, in the indoor environment, can make it possible to introduce natural elements in hospitals or institutions where there are limitations to the use of indoor plants. Furthermore, natural building materials are also visible when there may be limitations to the view through a window. © 2013 Taylor & Francis The psychological aspects of the relationship between the physical environment and human health and well-being constitute a major area of concern in the ﬁeld of study known as environmental psychology. Currently, new design strategies are emerging that focus on implementing the psychologically beneﬁcial eﬀects of nature to the built environment. Biophilic design Biophilic design emphasizes the necessity of transferring the beneﬁcial experience of nature to the built environment (Kellert 2005, 2008; Joye 2007). It builds on the biophilia hypothesis, which states that since humans have evolved in natural environments we have an innate aﬃnity toward nature and other living entities (Wilson 1984). According to Kellert (2008) both direct experiences with natural features in the built context (e.g. natural materials and window views to nature), indirect experiences (e.g. potted plants and water fountains), and symbolic representations of nature through images and pictures can all appeal to this innate aﬃnity and evoke positive experiences in built environments. It should be noted that the biophilia hypothesis is a generaltheoreticalapproach,anditdoesnotexplainthepsychological processes involved in human responses toward nature. Biophilia is further seen as a ‘weak’ biological tendency that depends on cultural learning for its full development (Kellert 2005). Within environmental psychology two major theories have been developed that describe the more speciﬁc psychological processes involved in human reactions toward nature, and in particular why nature has restorative or stress-reducing eﬀects. These are Kaplan and Kaplan’s (1989) attention restoration theory, which focuses on cognitive processes for restoration, and Ulrich’s (1983) psycho-evolutionary theory, which has a more aﬀective approach. However, both theories assign importance to natural features in the environment for stress reduction or restoration. To take humans’ psychological, physiological, and behavioural needs into consideration when designing buildings is important in all kinds of built settings (Hartig, Bringslimark, and Patil 2008). Even in people’s daily life it is important to go beyond mere survival to also consider quality of life and more salutogenic factors in the built environment that can possibly improve people’s health and well-being. However, implementing features that can enhance stress reduction or restoration in the built context might be especially important in settings designed for healing, such as hospitals. Evidence-based design Psychophysiological stress-reduction beneﬁts may mediate a variety of short- and long-term health beneﬁts. Some lead to a reduction in the use of healthcare facilities in a prison (Moore 1981) and faster recovery from surgery in a hospital (Ulrich 1984). In the indoor context, plants have been associated with an increase in pain tolerance (Lohr and Pearson-Mims 2000; Park, Mattson, and Kim 2004), decrease in self-reported health and discomfort symptoms (Fjeld et al. 1998), and a decrease in self-reported sick leave among oﬃce employees (Bringslimark, Hartig, and Patil 2007). Although evidence-based medicine is concerned with the quality of treatment (Timmermans and Mauck 2005), evidence-based design focuses on the quality of the built environment (Ulrich and Zimring 2004). Both approaches do, however, aim at applying the best available evidence gained from empirical research in decision-making. Even though evidence-based design is applicable to many types of building projects, it has focused primarily on hospitals and healthcare settings. Much of the work in evidencebased design is concentrated around physical factors that can reduce stressful exposures and support restoration for patients, family, and staﬀ. Thus, the main issue is to design healthcare environments that can amplify the healing process for patients, and that also might lead to less stressful experiences for hospital employees. According to Ulrich (2008), there is a considerable body of research on the inﬂuence of nature elements in healthcare settings on patients, staﬀ, and visitors. According to Ulrich, these studies include diﬀerent experiences with natural elements, such as physical activities in gardens or horticulture therapy, but most of the studies concern passive interaction with biophilic elements such as window views to nature, pictures of nature, or having other elements of nature indoors. Beneﬁcial outcomes from evidence-based biophilic design have been reduced stress-responses, improved emotional well-being, and pain alleviation. The use of evidence-based design has not been without critics (e.g. Stankos and Schwarz 2007), and healthcare decision makers have questioned the quality of the available evidence for health impact of healing environments (cf. American Society for Healthcare Engineering 2008). However, other review studies have shown possible healing eﬀects of the quality of the physical environment in healthcare settings (van den Berg 2005). Study The main objective of the study is to examine how elements of nature such as wood, pictures of nature, and window views to nature might possibly aﬀect Norwegian patients. As part of a larger study, we ﬁrst conducted a study on preferences for wood in patient rooms using employees at a hospital as an expert group. The earliest studies on human–nature relationships started with preference studies, especially preferences for landscapes (Ulrich 1985). One of the main assumptions guiding these studies was that the p g y; p wood to all wood (identiﬁcation of visual surfaces according to Figure 1).

Thus, preferences may signal possibilities for psychologically beneﬁcial outcomes and are therefore thought to provide indications for potential psychological beneﬁts. An anonymous e-mail questionnaire was sent out to employees in one department at a Norwegian hospital. All employees in the department were allowed to complete the survey. In order to investigate possible diﬀerences between workers visiting patient rooms in their daily work, such as nurses and physicians, and respondents who do not spend time in patient rooms, such as administrative and technical personnel, the responses were treated as separate groups in the analysis. The questionnaire was sent to the employees’ work e-mail address, and could be completed at work or at home. The questionnaire was accompanied by a cover message from the research team stating that the study was part of an evaluation of well-being in the newly built hospital facility. A total of 437 employees received the questionnaire; 102 employees returned their answers. The employees were nurses and auxiliary nurses (65.7%), physicians (13.7%), and other hospital staﬀ(administrative workers and technicians) (20.6%). The response rates corresponded well with actual staﬃng in the hospital: nurses and auxiliary nurses (70.0%), physicians (18.6%), and administrative and technical staﬀ(11.4%). Nine respondents completed less than 90% of the questionnaire; these responses were excluded from the study. Missing responses in the remaining dataset were treated as missing values in the statistical analysis. The questionnaire consisted of 10 computermanipulated pictures of a patient room with diﬀerent inte- riors. The interiors diﬀered with respect to wood use on a continuum from no wood to all wood (see Table 1 and Figure 1). The respondents evaluated all pictures. For each respondent, the pictures in the e-mail questionnaire were shown in a random sequence. That is, the employees answering the questionnaire were shown the pictures in different sequences. The option of showing the pictures in a Figure 1. Sketch of room and identiﬁcation of visual surfaces; ﬂoor (I), walls (II, III, IV), ceiling (V). The patients are positioned facing wall III (cf. Figures 2–4). random sequence was employed in order to avoid possible correlation between respondents’ ratings of the pictures. All pictures used in the questionnaire were based on a computer-generated model provided by the architect designing the hospital. A picture of a regular patient room with no wood was manipulated in order to provide diﬀerent interiors and furniture. Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of the room and the surfaces that were manipulated: (I) ﬂoor, (II) wall behind patient, (III) wall facing patient, (IV) wall with window, and (V) ceiling. The window view was identical for all pictures. The wooden surfaces were either from oak (Quercus) or pine (Pinus). Both materials are commonly used for indoor applications in Norway and the Nordic countries. Oak ﬂooring is commonlyusedinpublicbuildings,andhasbeenusedinanother department at the hospital. A picture with an oak wall was also used in the study in order to explore possible use of hardwood for other purposes than ﬂooring. Pine interior wooden wall cladding is common in Norwegian homes and was therefore also included in the study. In addition, the pictures included wooden or steel furniture. Participants were asked to rate the pictures on a scale from 1 to 7, where low values indicate low preference and high values indicate high preference. The participants were not explicitly asked to consider the room as part of their workplace. Instead, they were asked to rate the rooms on a 7-point scale according to whether they liked the room (‘I like the interior in this patient room’), whether they thought the interior was suited for a patient room (‘The interior is III II IV Room numbers 5 6 7 8 9 10 I like the interior in this patient room All respondents (n = 93) 3.37 3.45 3.70 3.91b 3.91b 4.18b 3.40 3.66 3.40 2.82b Nurses (n = 59) 3.10 3.39 3.51 3.61 3.70 4.12b 3.20 3.63 3.25 2.59 Physicians (n = 14) 4.36 4.08 4.43 4.64 4.57 4.93 4.00 3.86 3.85 3.36 Other staﬀ(n = 20) 3.45 3.20 3.75 4.32b 4.10 3.85 3.55 3.60 3.55 3.10b Th i i i ll i d f i The interior is well suited for a patient room All respondents (n = 93) 3.63 3.59 3.71 4.05b 3.85b 4.20b 3.45b 3.68 3.43b 2.69b Nurses (n = 59) 3.53 3.57 3.51 3.78 3.68 4.15 3.39 3.59 3.36 2.56b Physicians (n = 14) 4.14 4.23 4.43 4.79 4.50 4.79 3.71 4.14 3.85 3.00 Other staﬀ(n = 20) 3.60 3.25 3.80 4.37b 3.90 3.95 3.45 3.60 3.40 2.85b I ld lik t k i thi I would like to work in this room All respondents (n = 93) 3.44 3.61b 3.63b 3.89b 3.89b 4.13b 3.43 3.76b 3.43 2.91b Nurses (n = 59) 3.17 3.45 3.42 3.64 3.76b 4.14b 3.32 3.73b 3.39 2.66 Physicians (n = 14) 4.36 4.54 4.36 4.64 4.57 4.86 3.93 4.21 3.92 3.71 Other staﬀ(n = 20) 3.60 3.47 3.75 4.11 3.80 3.60 3.40 3.55 3.25 3.10b aMean preference scores.

The pictures were shown in a random sequence to all respondents. Statistical analysis A repeated measures analysis of variance was completed with each preference variable. In each analysis, room was treated as a within-subjects factor with 10 levels (corresponding to the amount and disposition of wood on surfaces) and professional group was treated as a betweensubjects factor with three levels (nurses, physicians, and other staﬀ). Given violation of the sphericity assumption in each analysis, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom are reported for the within-subjects main eﬀect of room and the room × professional group interaction. Subsequent within-subjects contrasts addressed diﬀerences between the standard patient room and each of the nine other rooms. Results Average preference scores for the patient rooms are reported in Table 2. The results indicated that room 6 (Figure 4), with an intermediate level of wood, was the most highly preferred. This room had the highest score on the preference item ‘I like the interior in this patient room’ (M = 4.18), and also on the items ‘The interior is well suited for a patient room’ (M = 4.20), and ‘I would like to work in this room’ (M = 4.13). The rooms at both ends of the continuum were the least preferred rooms. The regular hospital room with no wood (room 1, Figure 2) was in general rated among the Figure 2. Room 1: Standard patient room with no wood. The second least preferred room with respect to liking (‘I like the interior in this patient room’) and work environment (‘I would like to work in this room’). Figure 3.

The most preferred room. room’ (M = 2.82), ‘The interior is well suited for a patient room’ (M = 2.69), and ‘I would like to work in this room’ (M = 2.91). Note that all of these values fall below the midpoint of the scale. When the data were divided into groups according to the respondents’ profession, the overall impression of the results remained the same; room 6 (Figure 4) was the most preferred and room 10 (Figure 3) the least preferred. Physicians did in general rate all rooms higher than nurses and technical/administrative staﬀ. Statistical analysis revealed that the responses from nurses diﬀered statistically signiﬁcantly (cf. Table 2). Results from the repeated measures models are reported in Tables 3–5. For all models, the results indicate that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups of professionals. The within subjects eﬀect was signiﬁcant, i.e. preference for the rooms diﬀer signiﬁcantly due to room design. Interaction between room design and groups of professionals was not signiﬁcant. The results therefore indicate that it is the room design, i.e. the amount of wood that inﬂuences the stated preferences. Finally, a series of contrasts was used to compare possible diﬀerences between rooms. The standard patient room was compared with the other room designs in order to identify rooms that were rated signiﬁcantly better or worse than the standard patient room. Nine pairs were compared, i.e. room 1 vs. room 2, room 1 vs. room 3, . . . , room 1 vs. room 10. Table 3.

For the ﬁrst model, assessing overall preference, two rooms were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the standard room, rooms 6 and 8 (P value = 0.0320 and P value = 0.0497). Both rooms had higher preference scores than room 1. Rooms 6 and 8 had oak ﬂooring and furniture made of wood as well as wood on one wall. Room 8 also had pine in the ceiling. For the second model, assessing the suitability of the room as a patient room, room 10 was statistically signiﬁcant from room 1 (P value = 0.0085). Room 10 had the lowest overall score and was the room with wood on all surfaces, oak ﬂooring, and pine on all other surfaces. For the third model, assessing the rooms as work place, two rooms, rooms 5 and 6, were signiﬁcantly more preferred than room 1 (P value = 0.0282 and P value = 0.0046). Both rooms had oak ﬂooring and one pine wall, the only diﬀerence between rooms 5 and 6 was the materials that the furniture was made from (wood vs. steel). Conclusion Increased focus on environmental issues has resulted in the emergence of new sustainable building practices and design (Minke 2009; Ritchie and Thomas 2009). As the new design strategies emphasize the use of building materials with small or moderate environmental impact, there has been an increased focus on renewable materials such as wood (Bergman and Bowe 2008; Upton et al. 2008; Dodoo, Gustavsson, and Sathre 2009). wood, inﬂuences user preference. Hospital employees tend to prefer patient rooms with an intermediate level of wood. A regular patient room with no wood was not preferred; nor were rooms with extensive wood use. There are obviously limitations to how much wood is preferred. Preference studies are important because they provide some insights into what people like, and can also give some indications with regard to possible psychological or health-related outcomes since preferences are aﬀective responses. The results indicate that the preference for diﬀerent rooms was due to room design, and thus the amount of wood used in the interiors. There were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between diﬀerent groups of professionals. Furthermore, the contrast analysis indicated that rooms with an intermediate amount of wood are preferred to a traditional hospital room with no wood. Similar room designs are preferred both for overall appearance (I like the interior of this patient room) and the suitability of the room as place to work (I would like to work in this room). However, there are limits to how much wood should be used, in particular, the room with wooden ﬂooring and wood on all walls and in the ceiling was not considered suitable as a patient room. Therefore, designing the interiors (patient rooms) that are preferred by users is probably a good strategy for improving the work environment for the employees at the hospital. Mean scores are in general close to 4, i.e. neutral. This indicates that although there are preference variations among the rooms, few of them are truly liked to any great degree. Owing to hygiene regulations in Norwegian hospitals, wood surfaces have to be treated with a varnish because this makescleaningeasier.Useofsurfacetreatment,suchasvarnish, may inﬂuence the appearance of ‘naturalness’ of wood materials. Wood surfaces do in most cases have a darker colour compared to white ceilings and walls. This contrast is probably a relevant feature of wood and should be taken into consideration when applying the results. Contrasts between painted surfaces and wood surfaces may have a beneﬁcial eﬀect for the overall appearance of an indoor environment because it adds to the complexity of the room design. It must be kept in mind that hospitals are complex buildings where design aims at fulﬁlling a large array of diﬀerent functions. Including biophilic elements is just one of many strategies that may improve the physical environment in hospitals. Earlier studies have in general identiﬁed weak relationships between natural elements in built settings and health outcomes. The response rate can be considered a limitation to the study. Even though the respondents represent a sample of the employees, only 24% of the employees who were invited returned the questionnaire. Generalization of the results should as always be done with caution. The results correspond with the fundamental principles of biophilic design, since the inclusion of natural elements in the indoor environment evidently increases overall preference with respect to the interior of a hospital. Still, the results provide a more complex insight into this issue. There could congest. This indicates that biophilic design should take into account the fact that environments using natural elements must be carefully designed. Even though all groups of employees agree with respect to which rooms they prefer – and disprefer – the magnitude of the ratings vary. Physicians do in general give higher ratings to the rooms than nurses and administrative/technical staﬀ. This diﬀerence may be due to the employees’ knowledge of questionnairesandacquaintancewithparticipatinginthiskindof survey. It is, however, worth pointing out that the employee groups face diﬀerent working conditions. In particular, the results may be related to the fact most nurses spend their workday in hospital rooms caring for patients. The image of a patient room is therefore probably more associated with work demands than it is for the other groups. The eﬀects we have uncovered are rather small, and they do not concern clinical outcomes for patients or health outcomes for workers. Nevertheless, even small associations can have great practical signiﬁcance when aggregated over a large number of people over time. As pointed out by Clements-Croome (2005), design can improve the work environment, and thus aﬀect moods and improve work performance among nurses working at the ward, and possibly their services to the patients.     Introduction Patients in the hospital have hopes and expectations for health recovery and healing. Hospitals have recognized the relationship between the physical environment and patient outcomes and have focused on creating safe and aesthetically pleasing physical spaces. However, much of the work describing the relationship between the physical environment and patient outcomes has come from architects and designers. Consequently, it is focused on outcomes of interest to health-care organizations rather than those of the patients. Studies that provide an understanding of healing experiences from the patient’s perspective are limited and most have focused on healing at the end of life. An identified gap in the literature is how the physical environment influences the patient’s ability to experience healing. We postulate that creating a healing space, one that evokes feelings of serenity, calm, and relaxation, can contribute to an environment that facilitates the innate healing process—a process of repair, recovery, and return to wholeness in mind, body, and spirit (1,2). The hospital’s physical environment is 1 of the 4 interrelated areas that can maximize the patient’s innate healing process: the internal environment, individual healing intention and personal wholeness interventions; the interpersonal environment, the relationships that facilitate healing; the behavioral environment, the actions that we take to enhance health and facilitate healing; and the external environment, the physical environment where we work, live, and receive care (Figure 1). Background As early as 50 years ago, social scientists who examined the influence of the environment on human behavior identified that seating arrangements influenced patient interactions within a psychiatric ward (3). More recently, the application of science to design has had a remarkable impact on health care and health-care facilities. Evidence-based design (EBD) uses scientific tools to establish links between design and patient, family, and organizational outcomes. Its principles support design decision-making to improve safety, efficiency, and clinical outcomes. A review of EBD literature (4) revealed key design elements that influence patient, staff, and organizational outcomes (Table 1). A study by MacAllister (5) identified spatial features that impact patient satisfaction scores: bed location and orientation, window opening, point of first encounter, and nursing orientation in the room. Other than patient satisfaction, spatial features have been linked to other outcomes linked to room design that include reduced injuries, fewer infections, less stress, and improved quality of sleep (6,7). A systematic review by Dijkstra et al (8) examined the relationship between environmental stimuli in health-care settings and patient health and well-being. The study found that noise abatement interventions positively affected patients’ perceived quality of care. They also found that exposure to sunlight and pleasant ambient odors had significant positive effects on stress, pain, and mortality rate in women (8). Seven design strategies that contributed to healing in psychiatric settings include (a) single rooms, (b) calm, naturalistic, and domestic artwork or photographs, (c) eastfacing windows, (d) plants, (e) acoustic ceiling tiles, (f) low noise-producing unit areas, and (g) window views of nature (9). Schweitzer et al (10) described the ‘‘powerful and pervasive’’ link between the hospital environment and beha- viors, stating that ‘‘a positive toned mood affects how occupants feel in a space and affects physiological restoration’’ (10, pp. 72 and 79). Using the scientific model established in EBD, this study looks to understand healing spaces through the explicit exploration of the patient’s perspective. There is little published research describing patients’ engagement with their environment or patients’ perceptions of the impact of the environment on healing. A primary barrier to healing is stress and the environment can impact one’s stress (11,12). Specifically, Ulrich (12) identified the psychological and behavioral manifestations of support that have been promoted and enhanced by design features. These supportive design features afford a sense of control, positive distraction, and social engagement of the patient to improve their well-being and level of stress. While this exploratory study is not intended to further explore the theory of supportive design, it purports to take an initial step in understanding the connection between the physical environment and the patient, the interaction of the patient with the environment, and the patient’s perception of how the spatial features within the environment contribute or detract from the healing experience. Purpose The purpose of this mixed methods study was to gain a deeper understanding of healing spaces as a phenomenon experienced by patients and the meaning they assign to the physical environment in relation to a healing experience. Specifically, (1) How do inpatients receiving treatment for cardiac conditions experience their physical care environment? and (2) How does the physical care environment contribute either positively or negatively to their perception of their experiences of healing? Methods Research Design A mixed methods research design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, was used to better understand the impact of the physical environment on patients’ experiences. A phenomenological approach was used to gain an understanding of the patients’ experience of healing and their perception of how the physical space and its features (eg, inpatient room, furnishing, views, and equipment) contributed to their experience. Quantitative data were collected dur- ing the interviews by asking patients to rate specific aspects of their experience and the physical environment. Architectural drawings and observations of the physical environment were evaluated by the lead researcher (L.M.) for layout, size, furnishings, views, technology, and distractions. Figure 2 presents the data collection methods. Site Selection A list of potential hospital sites was generated based on the following criteria. The hospital (a) has a subscription to the C.A.R.E. Channel, (b) submits patient experience of care scores to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [HCAHPS]), (c) has a sufficient number of patients meeting eligibility criteria on specific units, (d) has participated in research in the past (ie, to achieve Magnet status), and (e) was able to designate an on-site principal investigator (PI). A member of the HHS team sent an introductory e-mail containing a project overview to the identi- fied nursing research leadership at 7 facilities. The SI researchers followed up directly with the sites by e-mail and phone to assess interest in the study. Of the 7 sites, 2 were willing and able to participate in this research project. Table 2 provides information on the 2 sites, WVUH and HCH, that collaborated on this study. Participant Selection and Enrollment In discussions with the collaborating site PIs, it was determined that a homogenous patient population would be opti- mal for this study and that patients with long-standing, stable cardiac disease would be a suitable cohort. Eligible study participants were those who met all of the following criteria: (a) aged 18 years or older, (b) diagnosed with congestive heart failure or had elevated troponin levels (>0.30 ng/mL), (c) occupied the current hospital room on 1 of the identified units for at least 48 hours and not more than 5 days, (d) oriented to person, place, and time and willing to give informed consent, and (e) fluent in English. Patients who had experienced any unexpected complications (eg, infection, cardiac, or respiratory arrest) during the current Figure 2. Mixed methods research model. hospitalization were not eligible to participate, as these confounders could negatively impact the patient’s perception of a healing experience. Inpatients receiving care in one of the study units at WVUH and HCH were screened for participation in the study by the nursing staff. The SI researchers did not have access to patient records, as all information was collected through the electronic health record by the clinical nursing staff. A designated unit nurse approached eligible patients, briefly explained the purpose of the study, and, if the patient was interested in participating, scheduled a time for the patient to meet with the SI researchers. After written informed consent was obtained, the researchers conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews and collected relevant data. Participant recruitment continued until themes were repeated fre- quently and saturation was achieved at each hospital. Data Collection and Sources Four sources of data were collected in this study: qualitative data, quantitative data, researcher observations, and analyses of architectural drawings and photographs. Qualitative data were collected through in-person interviews by 2 SI researchers in patients’ rooms. Open-ended questions inquired about patients’ perspectives on healing, healing spaces, and the contribution of the physical environment to their healing experience. The interviews lasted between 15 and 35 minutes and were audio-recorded with the participant’s permission. Interview questions and probes were structured to ensure that references to the C.A.R.E. Channel occurred at the end of the interview, unless the participant mentioned it spontaneously beforehand (Table 3). Quantitative data were obtained by asking participants to rate 3 areas on a 10-point Likert scale: their healing experience, their hospital room as a healing space, and the noise level in and around their room. Researchers collected observational data from patient rooms of study participants and recorded these on an environmental checklist (Table 4), noting spatial room features that have been shown to have an impact on health by Ulrich et al (4). Other important spatial features mentioned by participants during interviews were also noted. A final data source were architectural plans with room configurations, room measurements, and photographs of empty rooms that were obtained with permission. While the researchers had intended to collect aggregate room-specific HCAHPS scores as well as other patient’s self-reported outcomes, the organizations were not able to provide that level of detailed data in the required time frame for the study. The authors reviewed the publically reported HCAHPS data for the hospital units included in the study, and they were both similar in their outcomes. Data Analysis The SI research team reviewed the audio recordings and transcribed notes from the interviews. Key phrases that described how participants defined healing, healing spaces, and healing described healing in terms of being symptom-free (eg, ‘‘getting up and walking around without struggling to breathe’’ or ‘‘I had pain, then I didn’t have pain anymore; that is healing’’). Some described a healing experience as improving or returning to the state of normalcy (eg, ‘‘leaving the hospital in a better state than when you arrived’’ and ‘‘returning to a state before you were sick’’). Two participants understood healing to be something that the hospital staff did to or for them (eg, ‘‘they got me feeling like I’m back to me’’ and ‘‘they fixed me up’’). Two respondents characterized healing as something beyond getting better, getting well, or returning to normal. One participant characterized healing as ‘‘God’s grace.’’ Another described it as ‘‘complete something, improve, become whole,’’ elaborating on this with ‘‘learning something new and taking in new knowledge, understanding the world around you.’’ The experience of healing was predominantly described as a process of going from an illness state with bothersome or debilitating symptoms to a state of being better, well, or back to normal. Some viewed it as an external process of ‘‘being fixed’’ by hospital staff. A few described healing as a spiritual or a salutogenic process (eg, reaching completion, becoming whole). Average ratings of patients’ healing experience were 7.3 at WVUH (private rooms) and 6.8 out of 10 at HCH (semiprivate; Table 8). Healing Spaces Participants described a healing space in terms of the physical attributes of the space, the feelings that the space evoked, the familiarity of the space, its relationship to nature, spiritual or religious significance, and as a space where they felt cared for by attentive staff (Table 9). Having sufficient space and not feeling crowded or closed in were the most commonly mentioned physical attributes. Other physical attributes that were associated with healing spaces included privacy, natural light, quiet, and cleanliness. Participants described a healing space in terms of the positive feelings and sensations it evoked. A healing space felt calm, soothing, and relaxing, a place where one felt comfort and ‘‘cozy.’’ The theme of a home-like environment emerged, with descriptions of familiar rooms in the home (eg, bedroom, backyard) and being with family members. Seeing views of nature was frequently mentioned in describing home as a healing space. One participant described her porch swing in the backyard, ‘‘watching the trees grow’’ as a healing space. Another described her bedroom or kitchen with a view outside to the forest, ‘‘where I can see birds at the bird feeder and the deer.’’ Participants associated a spiritual connection with healing spaces. For some, it was the experience of being in church; for others, ‘‘talking to the Lord,’’ ‘‘serving God,’’ and receiving ‘‘spiritual care by the priest.’’ One participant said that a healing space is Nirvana, a place to improve your Table 2.

During discussions among the research team, the key themes that emerged from the patients’ perspective were ‘‘healing,’’ ‘‘healing spaces,’’ ‘‘healing experience enhancers,’’ and ‘‘healing experience detractors.’’ The quantitative and qualitative data were tabulated and integrated with the EBD literature to portray the phenomenon of healing spaces as experienced by patients in the hospital. Findings This study was conducted in 5 inpatient units in the 2 hospital facilities. Seventeen participants, 9 at WVUH and 8 at HCH, were enrolled. Study participant demographics are presented in Table 5. Researchers observed that patient rooms in both hospitals were austere in design and decor. Each room was furnished with a patient chair, hospital bed(s), an overbed table, TV(s), white board(s), and visitor chairs. All of the patient rooms met the minimal clearance around the bed of approximately 3 ft. The HCH was operated as semiprivate rooms, and the rooms in WVUH were all private rooms. The walls were painted in shades of white to gray, and the number of visitor chairs varied by room. Room specifics are detailed in Table 6 and Figure 3. Views from the bed varied from room to room; exemplars are shown in Figures 4 and 5. Healing Experiences Almost all of the participants responded that the term healing meant ‘‘getting better’’ or ‘‘getting well’’ (Table 7).

A few participants offered suggestions to make the hospital environment more like a healing space. Some addressed the physical space attributes (providing more space, privacy, natural light, quiet, neatness, and cleanliness), positive feelings (calm, relaxing, and soothing), and sensations (increas- ing comfort). Others suggested ways to bring in elements from their home and nature to the hospital room, recommending to ‘‘change the environment by adding the ability to connect with nature.’’ Some could not see the connection between a healing space they had just described and the hospital room, describing their current surroundings as Table 6.

Participants associated a healing space with being in their home, with family members, and with nature. Some Figure 5. Window view from Holy Cross Hospital (HCH). Table 7.

Healing Experience Enhancers and Detractors Healing experience enhancers. Several themes emerged that were categorized as ‘‘healing experience enhancers’’ in response to questions about how the hospital room and environment contributed to their healing experience (Table 10, Figure 6). Factors that contributed to a healing experience were positive attributes and features of the physical space, including low or no noise, access to indoor and natural light, comfortable hospital furniture, and adequate space. Fixtures and furniture that were described as healing contributors included medical equipment used by hospital staff to deliver care and visitor chairs for family visits. The hospital bed and chair were healing enhancers if they were perceived as comfortable. Participants identified care spaces including the staff and family zones in the room as healing enhancers as it enabled them to see people doing their job and to visit with friends and family. The attentiveness, caring, and competence of the hospital staff contributed to participants’ healing experiences. For many, visits from family members and feeling connected to home helped enhance their healing experience in the hospital. Taking time to rest and sleep and having ‘‘soothing Table 9.

Several participants described watching a TV channel that helped to create a sense of relaxation, calm, and comfort (eg, ‘‘it’s a very comforting station’’ and ‘‘it calms me when I’m ready to go to bed a night’’). When asked what they specifically liked, they mentioned that their favorite aspect was the music, the nature scenes, and feeling a ‘‘connection with God’s creation.’’ Although none of the participants explicitly mentioned the C.A.R.E. Channel by name, the researchers probed to sufficiently identify or display the channel they were describing. These healing experience enhancers are clustered into 7 groupings: the TV, furniture and fixtures, the care space, and 4 sensory features (ie, visibility, lighting, noise, and cleanliness). Table 10 presents these 7 groupings with the 3 com- monly mentioned experiential outcomes by the participants (ie, being cared for, feeling comfortable and calm, and being in home/familiar setting). Healing experience detractors. Participants responded to questions about what in the physical environment detracted from or negatively impacted their experience of healing; specifically, anything in the environment that caused pain, discom- fort, stressfulness, or agitation. The predominant themes described as ‘‘healing detractors’’ were attributes and features of the physical space over which the patient lacked any control to change (Table 11, Figure 7). Lack of control of physical features in the environment was shared when the patient was speaking about discomfort, agitation, and even pain. Examples included insufficient space in the room to maneuver or have visitors comfortably visit, uncomfortable hospital beds and chairs, a bothersome level of noise, lack of privacy, lack of cleanliness, and inability to control the room temperature. Additionally, participants described negative physical and mental states that detracted from their healing experience. For instance, the physical discomfort associated with medical treatments and conditions, as well as mental agitation and sadness due to their physical restrictions and debilitated state. One participant expressed frustration about Table 11. Patients Descriptions of Healing Experience Detractors.

A few negative encounters with hospital staff that lacked technical or interpersonal communication skills were also perceived as healing experience detractors. Passing time. Some activities that individuals described were time-passing distractions, which neither positively nor negatively impacted their healing experience. The most common distractor was watching TV. Nearly all participants turned on the TV during their hospitalization. For some, the TV was on as background (‘‘it’s just on for the noise’’), while others chose to watch familiar news programs, game shows, and sports that they watched at home. Other activities to pass the time included the use of other technology, with about onethird of participants using cell phones, computers, or tablets to check e-mail and use social media. Several described reading the newspaper, playing games, or watching people in the hall as time pass. Healing Space as Experienced by Hospitalized Patients In this study, we asked hospitalized patients to consider what healing meant to them, describe attributes of a healing space, and then identify what factors in their environment either Negative physical and mental state (mobility restricted, painful condition/treatment) 11 (34.4) Negative encounters with staff (lack of technical/ interpersonal skills) 3 (9.4) Total 32 Figure 7. Detractors from a healing experience related to experiential outcomes. contributed to or detracted from their healing experience during this hospitalization. Participants’ lived experiences of healing were from a pathogenesis perspective of going from an illness state with troublesome symptoms to a state of being better, well, or back to normal. Some viewed it as an external process of being fixed by the hospital staff. Few described healing beyond this illness context from a spiritual or a salutogenic perspective in alignment with the SI definition of healing as a process of cohesion of body, mind, and spirit (1). The phenomenological cataloging of responses systematically integrating all of the data collected into a cohesive picture resulted in 3 experiential outcomes of a healing experience that were influenced positively by the physical envi- ronment: (a) being cared for, (b) home-like environment, and (c) comfort and calm. These 3 themes clearly emerged through the interviews at each study site. The study participants shared their understanding of what was healing to them. While this is a personal emotive response, the themes discussed below were evident. Through the interviews with the patients, healing space evoked a sense of being cared for and included the attentive support that they received from family and hospital staff. The patients shared directly that the care from the nurses and doctors, and just being in the hospital to receive the care, was healing to them. They also shared that having the space for visitors and family members to stay with them was healing. This theme is more an action that is afforded by the environment. Spatial features that supported ‘‘being cared for’’ included having adequate space and chairs for visitors. Visibility and the presence of hospital staff supported this experience as well. Healing spaces evoked a sense of home. This sense of home enabled participants to establish a feeling of connection in an unfamiliar environment. This theme emerged through the comments that many of the patients, when asked about what is a healing environment, shared it was their own home. Watching favorite TV programs, having familiar furniture, having the family together, and seeing views of nature created this sense of home for some participants. This theme is a place that each person had and was able to clearly describe when asked. The patients described familiar items that triggered those memories and feelings. When asked if the home environment that they described could be found in their current hospital room, some could not see the connection, viewing their patient rooms as impersonal and utilitarian. Finally, healing spaces evoked feelings of comfort and calm. Being comfortable and calm tracked primarily to the furniture, views, and sensory comforts like ambient noise and temperature. This theme emerged from an awareness of the ambient environment: the features of the space that were being dealt with on an ongoing basis that were unfamiliar. The patients described situations that helped them to either cope with these items or found ways to identify what could further support them in feeling comfortable. These actions were things like closing the door, so the noise from the nurses did not disrupt the patient visiting their loved one. The TV was utilized by many of the participants to achieve a sense of calm by either using it to drown out the noise or help them to pass the time while in pain. Limitations As an exploratory mixed methods study, the sample size was small with 17 participants who were older (50-96 years) with chronic coronary conditions. While this was a limiting factor, it was intentional by the research team to try to further limit the outside influences to the patient and find a population that would have a 3-day stay with a very predictable and similar care protocol so that we could be certain that care did not vary between sites. The older population may have interests different from other populations, so the findings and themes derived were generalized to a wider population as well as correlated with greater research on supportive design. Another limiting factor could be the variation of the bed units being semiprivate and private. The research team found that, however, there may have been an opportunity for the semiprivate rooms to enhance detractors of the environment with a roommate. The team did not find that to be the case and the outcomes did not show an influence of the private and semiprivate spaces. Discussion Participants’ descriptions of healing space and healing experience enhancers are congruent with Ulrich’s theories of supported environments (12–15). The theory of supportive design identifies stress reduction as a primary pathway to healing and postulates that physical design supports social relationships, provides positive distractions, and enhances a sense of control. Similarly, participants in this study identified healing spaces with social support (ie, being cared for) and the comfort and familiarity of home. Research strongly supports the role of the visitors and family visits as a stress reducer (16,17). While a sense of control is a critical factor in Ulrich’s theory, participants did not specifically identify it as a contributor to healing experience in this study. In fact, we found the corollary to be true; many of the detractors to healing described by participants had to do with their lack of control over their physical environment (eg, insufficient space, uncomfortable furniture, lack of privacy, and moderate noise). Congruent with a study by Friedman et al (18), participants in this study highlighted the TV as a positive distrac- tion, using it to help sleep, as calming background noise, and to keep in touch with the outside world. Friedman et al (18) found that patients who were allowed to watch at least an hour of TV prior to surgery were less anxious than patients randomly assigned to routine care. Other studies have demonstrated that positive distractions, such as the TV, art, and nature, reduce stress and anxiety in patients (19,20), as contrasted with static views and lack of space (17). The findings of this study provide a further evidence of how the environment supports the perceived care and well-being of patients beyond the actual care they are receiving. These findings build on a foundation, as well as provide an opportunity, for further study of environmental contributors to healing using supported design theory. The TV was clearly a portal to the patient that afforded them to connect with something outside of their current situation. The interviews with the patients revealed that the TV was the primary element used to take their mind off the current situation, as well as provide relaxation. The variation of outcomes for the patient depended on the channel selection and how easy the TV was to openly ‘‘surf’’ the available stations. When the TVs were channel based, the patients were able to quickly find their favorite show that they watched at home or find a soothing channel that provided them a more calm environment to drown out the hospital noise. When the stations were within a menu of options, there was a higher frustration with engaging with the TV and the patients tended just to watch their ‘‘known shows,’’ and few of them found calming stations to sooth them. The findings in this study show that the TV can be a primary portal for the patient to find positive distraction connecting with the outside world as well as calm. Conclusion The physical environment provided cognitive, physical, and spiritual support through visual associations with home, comforting distractions, comfortable furnishings, and space that supported the patients’ social relationships with family and hospital staff. Patients offered real-life descriptions and understanding of the concepts of healing and healing spaces. Their pragmatic descriptions of healing space and their perceptions of the inpatient space differed from the researcher’s theoretical and idealistic descriptions. The theoretic definition of healing space as a physical environment that enhances cohesion of mind, body, and spirit and promotes social cohesion and healing relationships may need to give way to a more pragmatic definition. Patients identified healing space by the feelings the space evoked; specifically, a sense of being cared for, a sense of home, and feelings of comfort and calm. The present study confirms that there are spatial enhancers and detractors to a patients’ experience of healing beyond the care they are receiving and that patients can identify healing spaces with healing enhancers. With the knowledge of this information, the staff can engage the environment more greatly to support the patient. Hospital staff can use this study to further enhance the care that the patient receives to move toward healing. A healing space creates a sense of being cared for and reminds one of the best of being home, surrounded by a feeling of comfort and calm.     It is well established that sleep and mental illness share a bidirectional relationship where sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions worsen mental illness and vice versa (Pandi-Perumal et al., 2009). Indeed, sleep disturbances are a diagnostic criterion of mental illnesses (e.g., depression; American Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 1993) and are often the target of therapeutic interventions (Luca, Luca, & Calandra, 2013). Just as disturbed sleep is a marker of illness and its severity, restoration of regular sleeping patterns is a hallmark of clinical recovery (Baune, Caliskan, & Todder, 2006; Breitstein, Penix, Roth, Baxter, & Mysliwiec, 2014; Dolder, Nelson, & Iler, 2012; Pieters, Theys, Vandereycken, Leroy, & Peuskens, 2004). Although sleep disturbances are often dismissed as a symptom of psychiatric illness and are ineffectively screened for during inpatient stays, a variety of environmental factors in hospital may contribute further to sleep disturbance on psychiatric units (Reid, 2001). In psychiatric facilities, creating a sleep supportive environment is particularly challenging since noise, altered routines, and increased anxiety all interfere with good sleep (Reid, 2001). These milieu effects arise in addition to sleep disturbance produced by psychiatric illness and treatment of such illnesses (Monti & Monti, 2005). A hospital environment, particularly one with dormitory-type rooms, is unpredictable and likely to produce and be surrounded by a myriad of auditory and light stimuli generated in the shared bedroom itself and on the unit. The aggregate experience of such an environment may also undermine the patient’s sense of security and therefore ability to sleep. Finally, in hospitals where multiple patients share a room, disruptions of one another’s sleep because of social rhythms, visible symptoms, and social needs would likely be the norm rather than the exception. Notably, numerous studies indicate that the severity of sleep disturbance in psychiatric populations is associated with illness severity (Baune et al., 2006; Lemke, Puhl, & Broderick, 1999) and other clinical variables, including aggression and impulsivity (Kamphuis, Dijk, Spreen, & Lancel, 2014). Sleep disturbance is commonly reported during inpatient psychiatric hospitalization (Ferentinos et al., 2009; Lemke et al., 1999), and its disruption may represent a prognostic factor for recovery on the unit (Baune et al., 2006; Pieters et al., 2004). However, to date, no robust study has objectively examined sleep of inpatients with psychiatric illness, perhaps due to the difficulty of diagnosing sleep disorders in severely mentally ill patients (de Niet, Tiemens, & Hutschemaekers, 2010; de Niet, Tiemens, van Achterberg, & Hutschemaekers, 2011), and the perceived inadequacy of treatments for sleep disruption in hospital (de Niet et al., 2010; Rosenbaum, Sherrington, & Tiedemann, 2015; Vitinius et al., 2014). In addition, the study of sleep quality in psychiatric inpatients is often confounded by the use of traditional polysomnographic techniques. These techniques involve a variety of potentially disruptive conditions (anxiety from attachment of electrodes, drastic change in sleeping environment, etc.) pointing toward the need for alterna- tive, less invasive, methods of measuring sleep quality. One such method, actigraphy, holds some promise in that it provides a comparable index of sleep quality to polysomnography while maintaining patients’ natural social rhythms within a hospital setting (Marino et al., 2013). Despite the availability of actigraphy, the relation between environmental design characteris- tics and sleep quality in psychiatric populations remains surprisingly unexplored and the impact of evidence-based hospital design on sleep in hospitalized psychiatric patients is unknown. The redevelopment of a large psychiatric hospital in a major metropolitan area in central Canada provided an unprecedented opportunity to assess this relationship. The new building was constructed on the same grounds as the old facility controlling for a variety of confounding environmental factors including proximity to social services, the landscape and grounds, and the culture of the surrounding neighborhood. This redevelopment marked a transformation from a 1950s era sociopetal (Osmond, 1957) style mental health facility to a state-of-the-art ‘‘evidence-based design’’ informed hospital that included a variety of improvements over the old facility. One of the most notable features, hypothesized from the time of initial design to potentially impact sleep quality, was the switch to single patient rooms from dorm-style rooms on the old units. This allowed patients to sleep alone, with nearly complete control over access to their room, control of natural and artificial light, and an en suite bathroom. Inasinglebedroom,withalockabledoor,anden suite bathroom, the level of noise, light, and social disruptionislikelytobemuchless,bothfrominside the room and from the unit given the patient has control over their own door, lighting, and windows. The hospital was specifically designed to control noiselevelsthroughtheadditionofimprovedsound proofing of walls and doors as well as the use of the climate control systems to generate a small background of white noise. Additional procedural fea- tures such as minimizing overhead pages add to the level of noise control and deinstitutionalization of the facility. Also, given the degree of con- trol patients have over these features, the patients’ sense of privacy and security is likely to be much higher and thus produce more favorable physical and psychological conditions for restorative sleep. Other centers have reached similar conclusions (Ulrich, 2006); however, we are not aware that this notion has ever been formally tested using objective measures. Finally, a systematic review demonstrates a positive effect of single patient rooms in hospitals (van de Glind, de Roode, & Goossensen, 2007), but this review did not include psychiatric hospitals, which present unique challenges. The overarching goal of the present study was to examine the impact of a new facility on the sleep quality of hospitalized psychiatric patients. We examined sleep characteristics and circadian rhythms of a population of psychiatric inpatients with heterogeneous diagnoses in order to determine whether sleep characteristics, particularly nightly disturbance, could be significantly impacted by hospital environment factors, including natural light exposure, improvements in unit layouts and amenities, but primarily by each patient having an individual bedroom that included control of light and noise. As part of a larger evaluation project, this study was a priority because of the integrated effect of design features. Specifically, the implementation of single patient bedrooms is increasingly the norm for hospital design; an improvement in sleep quality would represent an important justification for these design features. Accordingly, a cross section of participants with a variety of mental illnesses filled out subjective questionnaires and was followed over the course of 7 days with actigraphy and daily sleep interviews. These measures were administered before and after our move from a 1950s era building with dorm-style bedrooms (either two or four sharing) to a facility that is approximately 850,000 square feet, features single bedrooms, larger wards with access to more amenities, and enhanced exposure to natural light in the ward milieu. With so few relevant studies to draw from, and considering the prevalence and severity of sleep disturbance in this population, we tentatively hypothesized that we would find some evidence of an improvement in sleep quality in the new facility. Method Participants The design was a pre–post cross-sectional survey consisting of two patient samples with minimal overlap ofparticipants betweenthe two timepoints. From September 2013 to February 2014, N ¼ 47 adult participants (mean age ¼ 37.3 [SD: 15.0]; 22 male: 25 female) were recruited into the study prior to the reconstruction of the mental health facility (see Table 1 for a description of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample). Following the redevelopment, in September 2014 to February 2015, an additional N ¼ 47 adult participants (mean age ¼ 39.4 [SD: 14.3]; 25 male: 22 female) were recruited. Inclusion criteria for study participation included patients currently undergoing treatment for a mental illness and admitted to the psychiatric inpatient units. Exclusion criteria included history of acquired brain injury, developmental delay (e.g., documented Intelligence Quotient < 70), and presence of neurological/neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, we excluded anyone with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder such as insomnia. The study was approved by the local Research Ethics Board. Signed informed consent was obtained for each participant. In addition, consent was obtained to review medical and psychiatric chart information for each participant. Table 1.

Primary Outcomes At study onset, participants were equipped with an actigraph (Littner et al., 2003) to be worn for a 7-day period (a minimum of five 24-hr periods of full data were required to be considered complete data) during which questionnaires and daily interviews were completed. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a 10-item self-report instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep. It differentiates ‘‘poor’’ from ‘‘good’’ sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0–3 scale, where a rating of ‘‘3’’ reflects the negative extreme on the Likert-type scale and a score of ‘‘0’’ represents the opposite. The PSQI has a reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s a) of .83 for its seven components. To avoid comprehension issues, the scale was administered as an interview upon initiation into the study. Actigraphy. Actigraphy is a method used to study sleep–wake patterns by assessing movement, most commonly of the wrist using a watch-like device. Actigraphy is reliable and valid for detecting sleep in normal, healthy populations and has the advantage of being able to measure multiday human rest-activity patterns and the estimation of sleep– wake patterns (Littner et al., 2003). For the present study, the ActiLife 6 analysis software was used with ActiSleepþ wristbands from ActiGraph Corp. to objectively measure sleep. The Cole– Kripke sleep scoring algorithm in ActiLife 6.10.4 was used to score sleep variables of participants. In order to account for the highly irregular sleeping patterns observed in this sample, adjustments to sleep periods were made according to observational rounds from participant charts. Daytime naps and short nightly sleep periods (e.g., <3 hr) were frequently present in our sample and overlooked by automatic sleep scoring, and as a result, all sleep periods (including any night and daytime sleep periods that met a 1-hr threshold length) were identified by verifying actigraphy with observational rounds data, summed over 24-hr periods and averaged for the week. Sleep diary. A sleep diary was used to collect daily data via interview on sleep and other variables that affect sleep quality (e.g., caffeine; napping; subjective measures of sleepiness, fatigue, mood). Participants scored their overall sleep on a scale ranging from 0 very poor to 3 excellent. Secondary Outcomes Horne–Ostberg Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). This scale assesses an individual’s tendency toward being a ‘‘morning’’ or ‘‘evening’’ type and represents an important demographic specifier in relation to changing sleep quality in a new environment. The MEQ produces a total score between 16 and 78, where lower scores indicate an evening type and higher scores indicate a morning type. It has a reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s a) of .83. In order to facilitate comprehension, the scale was also administered as an interview upon initiation into the study. Chart. Chart information was used to reliably and efficiently capture demographic characteristics of participants. We extracted participants’ basic demographic (e.g., age, sex), clinical (e.g., diagnosis, length of stay, medications), and observa- tional rounds information from their charts, which includes nursing observations of patients’ sleep schedules. Results Statistical Analysis Toexaminegroupdifferencesinage,questionnaire, and actigraphy variables, independent samples ttests or Mann–Whitney U tests were conducted, depending on normality of data (assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test). For the calculation of correlations, depending on normality of data, Pearson or Spearman correlations were used. Significance was set at a ¼ .05 for all analyses. All sample data except for the actigraphy autocorrelation scores and age were not normally distributed, and as a result, an independent sample t-test and Pearson correlation was used for actigraphy autocorrelation scores and U tests and Spearman correlations for all others. Proportions of categorical variables pre- and post-move were compared using w2 analysis. Analyses were conducted with SPSS 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and R 3.0 statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Demographic Characteristics Participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. There were n ¼ 22 male and n ¼ 25 female participants pre-move with an average age of 38.11 years and n ¼ 25 male and n ¼ 22 female participants post-move with an average age of 39.36 years. PSQI There were no significant differences in any of the seven domains of the PSQI or its global score pre- and post-move (ps > .05; see Table 2). The number of participants who fell in the categories of good or poor sleepers did not change (p > .05). Although the mean global score decreased, it Table 2. Questionnaire Results.

Finally, a large proportion of individual participants’ global scores (77%) across both time points were above the threshold. Sleep Diary Although none of the data from the selfreported sleep diaries were statistically signif- icant between the two time points, participants’ subjective overall ratings of sleep quality improved slightly at the second time point (see Table 2). This result trended toward significance. Actigraphy Actigraphy data were averaged across the examination period and summarized into indices of (i) sleep efficiency, the ratio of time spent sleeping to time in bed presented as a percentage; (ii) total sleep time, the number of minutes spent sleeping per night; (iii) wake after sleep onset, the number of minutes the participant spent awake each night; (iv) total time in bed, the number of minutes the participant spent in bed each night; (v) latency, the number of minutes it takes to fall asleep each night; (vi) number of awakenings per night; and (vii) autocorrelation which quantifies how regular a person’s sleep cycle is (see Table 3).

Sleep efficiency significantly increased while wake after sleep onset, total time in bed, latency, number of awakenings, and autocorrelation all significantly decreased following the move; total sleep time did not differ significantly. The length of participants’ current admission was significantly corre- lated with both total sleep time and wake after sleep onset. Horne–Ostberg MEQ There were no significant correlations between the score on the MEQ and the actigraphy indices; however, the MEQ did correlate significantly with sleep quality and latency scores of the PSQI and was trending toward a significant correlation with the global score. Discussion This study is the first to reveal a significant impact of evidence-based hospital design features on sleep quality among psychiatric inpati- ents. Specifically, there was a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality following a move from an older hospital environment with dorm-style rooms to a new hospital that incorporated evidence-based design features, including private sleeping quarters, maximized natural light, and full patient control over noise and light exposure. Here, the collection of actigraphy data illustrated a significant decline in the amount of nightly sleep dis- turbance in the sample from the new facility. Sleep efficiency, a global measure of sleep quality, increased significantly while the number of minutes of wake time after sleep onset, a key indicator of nightly sleep disturbance, decreased significantly, showing the largest decrease (i.e., effect size) among all of the actigraphy measures. Finally, patients experienced a significant decrease in the number of awakenings each night. By assessing sleep quality pre- and post-move to a new facility, we were able to illustrate directly the positive impact that evidence-based design features, most prominently, individual bedrooms, had on mitigating the deleterious impact of environmental stimuli on sleep quality among psy- chiatric inpatients (noise from roommate’s psychiatric symptomology and care needs and from the unit, shared artificial and natural lighting, etc.). . . . there was a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality following a move from an older hospital environment with dorm-style rooms to a new hospital that incorporated evidencebased design features, including private sleeping quarters, maximized natural light, and full patient control over noise and light exposure. By assessing sleep quality pre- and postmove to a new facility, we were able to illustrate directly the positive impact that evidence-based design features, most prominently, individual bedrooms, had on mitigating the deleterious impact of environmental stimuli on sleep quality . . . Interestingly, although these objective data point strongly toward the positive impact of the rebuilt environment on sleep quality, there was no difference in subjective sleep quality between the two groups. This finding is in line with a wide body of evidence pointing toward discrepancies in objective measurements of sleep quality in inpatient psychiatric settings (e.g., mood disorders, addictions, eating disorders) and patients’ subjective report (see Pyrke, McKinnon, Langstaff, Gillard, & Bieling, 2016). Factors that may contribute to this discrepancy include cognitive limitations that may impact responding on complex scales that rely upon recall of past events and the relative sensitivity of objective and subjective measures of sleep quality. The PSQI requires participants to consider their past month of sleep, which may be not only cognitively difficult for this population but also could be confounded by reports of sleep at home if the participant has not been in hospital for one full month. Furthermore, the sleep medication subscale of the PSQI may have been inflated due to the timing of psychiatric medication dosing as a sleep aid and metabolic. Indeed, previous reports indicate that subjective report may exaggerate the severity of schedulerelated measures of sleep quality (e.g., sleep dura- tion, latency) resulting in a lack of correlation with more complex sleep quality variables (e.g., sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset; Baune et al., 2006; Brooks, Krumlauf, Whiting, Clark, & Wallen, 2012; Kung, Chou, Lin, Hsu, & Chung, 2015; Lemke et al., 1999; Matuskey, Pittman, Forselius, Malison, & Morgan, 2011; Staner et al., 1995; Wallen et al., 2014; Woodward, Bliwise, Friedman, & Gusman, 1996; Yamahara, Noguchi, Okawa, & Yamada, 2009). Here, it is probable that whereas objective measurement techniques may represent key diagnostic tools for assessing sleep quality, subjective report may be equally crucial in indexing patient perceptions regarding sleep quality. Notably, patients who reported being more of an evening type tended to report more severely disturbed sleep on the PSQI. From a clinical standpoint, the hospital environment may be less accommodating of this sleeping pattern raising the possibility that the PSQI may capture some aspect of attitudes regarding difficulties attaining an individual’s ideal sleeping pattern (e.g., late morning awakening) in this subpopulation. It is further notable that the actigraphy analysis revealed relatively high durations of time spent in bed in our patient sample (mean between 9 and 10 hr for both groups) as compared to studies in other populations (Matuskey et al., 2011; Wallen et al., 2014). In contrast to previous studies, our sample included patients with schizophrenia, a population that may have increased sleep duration. Notably, this increased duration resulted in sleep efficiency levels above 85% (a value which is thought to be within the ‘‘normal range’’ for shorter durations of sleep) despite patients’ subjective reports of disturbed subjective sleep quality. Unfortunately, it was not possible to accurately link patient self-reported sleep logs to the actigraphy data, and instead observational nursing rounds were used to adjust bed times when reviewing automatically generated sleep periods. Here, patient sleep logs may have suffered inaccuracies due to difficulty recalling the duration of sleep period (exacerbated by burden of illness among some participants). Many participants also napped frequently and for an extended period throughout the day, an activity that was difficult for participants to chart accurately. Finally, although there was a significant reduction in the latency to fall asleep after the move, the latency in general appears to be underestimated as the values are comparatively small when considering previous findings that control more care- fully for latency (Baune et al., 2006). Interestingly, patients’ circadian rhythms within the new building were less regular (autocorrelation value at a cycle period of 24 hr decreased) than in the old facility. Notably, severe mental illness may further cause disruptions in neurological circadian timings and result in highly irregular, but metabolically cued, sleeping patterns (Pritchett et al., 2012).Indeed, forcing a sleep rhythm onto an individual might have the countertherapeutic effect of decreasing sleep quality despite the appearance of a more regular sleeping pattern. The primary limitation of the study was that our sample consisted of individuals with heterogeneous and often comorbid psychiatric disor- ders, although, as a result the findings are also likely to generalize to similar inpatient psychiatric facilities. Unfortunately, given the severity of illness and comorbidity in this population, and the burden of the current study protocol, an approach where a diagnostic interview was conducted to enroll a single or specific diagnosis would not have been feasible. This would have excluded many of our participants, resulting in the selection of a subset of patients who are cognitively well enough to endure a lengthy assessment battery and not representative of the larger population. Paired samples were also an impossibility, given the average length of stay of patients; few patients whom we studied in the old building moved to the new building. A second limitation was the conflicting subjective and objective results. Although our findings are supported by previous literature identifying a difference between the two, ideally improvements would have been observed in both or demonstrated some correlation. Conclusion The recent move of our hospital from an older building with dorm-style rooms to a new facility with private sleeping quarters provided an unprecedented opportunity to systematically and objec- tively assess, with a high level of ecological validity, the clinical value of new evidence-based design features for psychiatric inpatients. Here, we found that a novel, objective measure of sleep quality (actigraphy) revealed a significant improvement in sleep quality among psychiatric patients undergoing hospitalization following the move. This study illustrates the merits of using a noninvasive and objective measure of sleep quality, actigraphy, to gauge sleep quality in inpatient settings. As a result, actigraphy offers a compelling combination of practicality and objectivity, and future studies should focus on differences between specific psychiatric populations and diagnoses, given that sleep disturbance does have some unique aspects in different disorders. Also, it is possible that design and milieu elements have a differential impact depending on the patient’s presenting problems and treatment provided. More- over, this study raises broader questions about sleep quality in hospitalized patients beyond mental health settings. Here again, actigraphy offers the opportunity to better understand sleep patterns in hospitalized patients and can be used not only in basic research paradigms but also quality improvement approaches to test for design solutions that have the most robust impact. For example, research could be designed to disentangle the impact of sound, light, and privacy to better understand the most critical specific design element. These findings have important implications both for clinical treatment and for decisions concerning the design of healthcare facilities. These data suggest that the integrated effect of increased natural light exposure and control over that light, noise reducing features such as white noise, and critically, individual patient rooms, have a significant influence over clinically relevant psychia- tric variables such as sleep quality. Furthermore, these data illustrate a clear methodological confound within hospital-related sleep literature where features of the built environment are not considered, described, or controlled for. Specifically, these results provide clear support for the introduction of private rooms to all new psychiatric facilities on the grounds that sleep quality would be expected to improve. Design of psychiatric facilities should further consider features such as natural light exposure and patient control of noise and light as critical features likely to have valuable clinical impact. Finally, this work raises the possibility that actigraphy could become a valuable clinical tool—a practical and objective method to examine sleep in specific patients over time, with improvement in sleep variables becoming a valuable therapeutic target. . . . these results provide clear support for the introduction of private rooms to all new psychiatric facilities on the grounds that sleep quality would be expected to improve. Implications for Practice \u0004 Private sleeping quarters represent a key opportunity to improve sleep quality in psychiatric inpatient settings; this is important, given sleep disruption is common in this population. \u0004 Nonpharmacological interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in psychiatric inpatient settings should consider carefully the influence of environmental characteristics. Improving environmental factors can enhance sleep quality. \u0004 These data suggest that the impact of environmental characteristics on sleep is pro- found and that inpatient sleep can be noninvasively measured. Clearly, clinical decisions and treatment directed at sleep of psychiatric inpatients should be guided by a combination of objective and self-report measures, and environmental interventions should form the first line of treatment.     Patient safety in health care settings is a well-recognized  priority for health care organizations (Agency for Health­ care Research and Quality, 2013; Joint Commission,  2014, 2015). Fall prevention essentially links to patient  safety (Ulrich et al., 2008), since a fall resulting in an  injury within a hospital setting may complicate the health  status, length of stay, or result in additional heath complications of patients, adversely affecting the quality of care  and health care utilization (Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality, 2013). Research shows 30% of  falls occurring in hospital settings lead to physical injuries and additional treatments, which is problematic for  the patient and increases hospitalization costs (Lavsa,  Fabian, Saul, Corman, & Coley, 2010). For falls resulting  in a more severe injury, such as a hip or pelvic fracture or  upper extremity fracture, the average the length of the  hospital stay increases 6 to 12 days. This can increase  hospital costs up to $35,561 (Wong et al., 2011). In 2008, the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services’ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) initiated changes to reimbursements received by  hospitals to incentivize patient safety and quality care.  This change followed the release of the Institute of  Medicine’s findings on high-frequency events that threatened patient safety during hospitalization (Inouye,  Brown, & Tinetti, 2009). This prompted CMS to develop  a list of high-cost and high-volume patient risks within  hospital settings; in 2013, this list grew from 8 to 14 concerns, with patient fall risks remaining a central concern  (CMS, 2015). In other words, hospital administrators are  expected to seek and implement preventive measures to  reduce or eliminate patient falls and are in jeopardy for  not being reimbursed for treating patient fall outcomes  that require additional treatment. The call for inquiry on psychiatric patient falls is compelling, given the high fall risk of this vulnerable popula- tion. Psychiatric patients are estimated to experience falls  at a higher rate than other hospitalized adults; indeed, 13  to 25 falls per 1,000 inpatient days compared with other  adult patients in medical–surgical units (Blair & Gruman,  2005). Unlike most adult inpatients in medical–surgical  units, psychiatric patients are typically not limited to their  beds, which in itself is a contributor to falls. In addition,  psychiatric patients may be more likely to be prescribed  sedating drugs that elevate the potential for falling,  whereas medical–surgical patients require fewer sedative  drugs with side effects linked with fall risks. There is  strong evidence linking psychiatric patient falls to psychotropic medications (Estrin, Goetz, Hellerstein,  Bennett-Staub, & Seirmarco, 2009). In fact, falls can  increase by 78% when antipsychotic drugs are taken  (Bloch et  al., 2014). Another study by Williams et  al.  (2015) showed that diagnoses such as depression and  anxiety per se are not significant fall contributors; however, psychotropic medication, antidepressant, and ben- zodiazepine use are linked to patient falls. Difficulties in  maintaining balance and other side effects of psychotropic drugs increase the risk of falls, and include sedation,  confusion, balance issues, difficulty in neuromuscular  coordination, and changes in vision, blood pressure, and  cardiac rhythm (Howland, 2009). Other factors contributing to patient falls can be those stemming from aggres- sive, agitated behavior, rapid movements among manic  patients, suppressed movements, including gait changes,  typical of clinically depressed patients (Morse, 2008). Among the many factors associated with falls, the role  of the physical environment is deserving of close study. A  longitudinal study from 1995 to 2003 by the Joint  Commission attributed 44% of patient falls to the physical environment (Hignett & Masud, 2006). While experts  encourage promoting a safety culture within the hospital,  patient care in health care environments can suffer from  factors including caregiver workload, inconsistencies in  communication related to patient data, and even inadvertent limitations posed by the design of the facility. In fact,  some argue that the physical environment can be more  influential in improving patient safety in hospitals when  compared with creating a safety culture alone (Lopez,  Gerling, Cary, & Kanak, 2010). For these reasons, all  influential fall factors should be considered as ways to  ensure patient safety. From a work system standpoint, the physical environment is a component of a larger system including people  and organizations, as described in a model developed by  Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety, which  aims to improve patient safety through synergies between  (a) organization, (b) person, (c) technology, (d) tasks,    and (e) the physical environment (Carayon et al., 2006).  Guided by the work system approach, a study by Taylor  and Hignett (2016) systematically reviewed the body of  literature on inpatient falls and classified patient fall contributors into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The over- arching themes under extrinsic category include those  related to the environment (workspace envelope, personal  workspace, products, and ambient environment), organization (staffing and maintenance), and people (patients  and staff); the intrinsic categories were related to physiological and psychological conditions of patients, which  includes the extrinsic physical environment, people, and  organization (Taylor & Hignett, 2016). This generated a  framework for understanding falls in hospital settings  called SCOPE of falls, which is theoretical model categorizing falls such that environmental factors, in addition to  people and organization, are one of the main factors  involved in fall events. The role of the environment on falls has not been well  studied in inpatient psychiatric settings where the care  dynamics significantly differ from other inpatient settings  (Shepley & Pasha, 2013). Therefore, this study aims to  describe the spatial and temporal patterns of falls occurrences, their location along the levels of safety contin- uum, and the role of the physical environment on falls. Method Design and Setting A case study method, using quantitative and qualitative  data collection and analysis, was adopted to allow for an  in-depth exploration of 7 years of fall-related sentinel  events at one 81-bed academic psychiatric hospital. The  qualitative data about environmental and situational factors that were perceived to be involved in patient falls  were analyzed using content analysis of open-ended sentinel event narratives, which also allowed for quantitative  summaries of the fall events in relation to the environment and the type of space in which they occurred. In the psychiatric hospital under study, patients had an  average length of stay of 8 days. More than 150 staff  members worked in this facility, a 27-year-old, one-story  hospital located in the southeast region of the United  Figure 1.  Space types based on the levels of safety framework. States. The facility included five units, four of which  were included in this study. The fifth, an eating disorders  unit, was excluded from the study due to small number of  patients and fall events. The four units that were investigated had a combination of single and double rooms with private bathrooms.  Each of the four units included an open communal area in  the center adjacent to the nursing station, which was  enclosed with glass to maximize visibility and connection  with the patients. Bedrooms were located around the  communal area. Each unit had a dedicated patio for  patient activities. Figure 1 shows the floor plan of each  unit. In addition to these four units, the study included  data from the intake unit where patients were first examined before being admitted to one of the four units. The patient population differed across the four units.  Unit 1 was dedicated to children and adolescents with age  range of 7 to 23 years. Unit 2 focused care on adults with  depression and elders, including 19- to 100-year-old  patients. Unit 3 included patients with alcohol or substance abuse issues between ages of 19 and 85 years. Unit  4 contained patients with psychotic disorders, with an age  range of 15 to 87 years. Data Collection This study used 7 years of retrospective data (sentinel  events) collected between January 2007 and December  2013, the only available data in digital format at the time  of data retrieval. The data collection phase was performed  after obtaining institutional review board approval and  was conducted by reviewing the sentinel events record of  7 years. The sentinel event reports were recorded by staff  members, usually a nurse or a mental health technician.  All fall records contained the following information: (a)  time of the fall event, (b) level of severity of the injury  from the fall, (c) age, and (d) patient diagnosis. Hospital  protocol required that each fall episode be classified into  one of 10 standardized fall scenarios: (a) fall from Hoyer  lift, (b) fall from bedside commode, (c) fall outside of  patient room, (d) fall while picking something up, (e) fall  from toilet, (f) fall from bed, (g) fall from chair, (h) found  on the floor and reporting a fall, (i) fall while walking  (ambulating), and (j) other types of falls. Although there  were two observation rooms per unit equipped with video  cameras and motion detectors for high-risk patients,  especially those prone to falls, the data collected for this  study did not contain video-recorded information. Each sentinel record contained a brief open-ended narrative of the sentinel event that described the situation,  context, and patient status perceived by the report writers  to have played a role in the episode. Content analysis was  performed on these narratives. The coding key for content analysis included levels of safety environmental fac- tors (Bayramzadeh, 2017; Hunt & Sine, 2009), the  association with the physical space based on the SCOPE  of falls model (Taylor & Hignett, 2016), and multisystem  fall prevention model (Choi, Lawler, Boenecke, Potoski,  & Zimring, 2011). Data Analysis Two coders with design background were trained together  on 60 randomly selected sentinel event reports to determine whether those events were related to the physical  environment according to Levels of Safety framework  and SCOPE of Falls model. After agreeing to a coding  strategy, all cases, referencing the physical environment,  were coded independently. Following this, a second sorting was done. The fall rate was calculated for the hospital  by diving the total number of falls by the number of  patient days, multiplied by 1,000. All fall events were first categorized as witnessed or  unwitnessed falls. Witnessed falls refer to those observed  by staff, and unwitnessed falls to those not seen by staff  or others. Next, within each of these two categories, falls  were divided into intrinsic and extrinsic, based on a study  by Taylor and Hignett (2016). Extrinsic factors are those  that are not inherent within the condition of patient’s  physiological or psychological status, whereas intrinsic  conditions are those related to preconditions the patient  had already acquired. The extrinsic category included  factors related to the environment (workspace envelope,  personal workspace, products, and ambient environment), organization (staffing and maintenance), and peo- ple (patients and staff); intrinsic factors were related to  physiological and psychological conditions of patients  (Taylor & Hignett, 2016). Workspace envelope is defined  as physical attributes of the environment such as proximities of different spaces. Personal workspace refers to  areas surrounding people and often associated with specific functionalities such as workstation or interactions  such as those with furniture or equipment. Products  include furniture or equipment, and ambient environment  includes environmental conditions such as light and noise  (Taylor & Hignett, 2016). Additional subcategories were  added to the existing ones as determined necessary for  this study. Fall events were divided according to the levels of  safety framework (Bayramzadeh, 2017; Hunt & Sine,  2009), which describes safety risks that are linked to the  type of location and level of supervision by staff on those  locations. These locations are categorized as (a) staff service areas, (b) corridors, (c) dayrooms, (d) patient rooms  and bathrooms, (e) admission spaces, and (f) seclusion  areas. For example, there are fewer opportunities for  appropriate staff supervision in private bedrooms and  bathrooms than in public spaces in the facility such as  dayrooms. Results A total of 818 inpatient falls was recorded from January  2007 to December 2013. The highest number of falls was  recorded in Unit 2, a geropsychiatric unit including  patients diagnosed with major depression, with 39% of  all falls (n = 315) and a rate of 6.9 falls per 1,000 patient  days over the 7-year period. The second highest number  of falls was recorded in Unit 3, the alcohol and substance  abuse unit, with 32% of all falls (n = 259) and a rate of 6.8  falls per 1,000 patient days for the 7-year period. This  was followed by Unit 4, the adult psychiatric unit, with  25% of falls (n = 203) and a rate of 4.9 falls per 1,000  patient days. The child and adolescent unit (Unit 1) contributed to 3% (n = 25) of the reported falls in the hospi- tal, with a fall rate of 2.3 per 1,000 patient days. The  intake unit incurred 1% (n = 10) of falls. The overall fall  rate for the hospital was 5.8 per 1,000 patient days.  Environmentally related falls were specifically 15%    (n = 83) of all falls, while 85% (n = 496) of events  appeared to be related to organization (n = 14, 2.4%),  people (n = 176, 30%), intrinsic factors (n = 135, 23%),  and some were unknown (n = 171, 30%). Of 818 falls, those that specified patient gender totaled  653 sentinel events with 49.7% (n = 325) female and  50.3% (n = 328) male. Falls across three nursing shifts  were categorized into day (7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.), evening (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.), and night (11:00 p.m. to  7:00 a.m.). The results showed most falls occurred in the  evening shift with 37% (n = 304), followed by the day  shift with 35% (n = 288) and the night shift with 28% (n  = 225). In addition, the severity for each fall scenario was  categorized as follows: no injury, minor injury (e.g.,  slight bleeding, mild skin abrasion), and major injury  (e.g., head injury and hypertensive crisis, severe pain,  fractures, bleeding). The results showed that in 272 total  falls citing extrinsic factors, 68.4% (n = 186) of falls did  not result in any injury, 29.4% (n = 80) of falls resulted in  minor injury, and 2.2% (n = 6) of falls resulted in a major  injury; see Table 1. The content analysis of the sentinel events narratives  showed that 45% of the events (n = 263) were witnessed  and 55% (n = 316) were unwitnessed. Of 579 falls for  which qualitative data were available, 270 falls (47%)  were related to extrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors included  the environment (e.g., workspace, ambient environment),  the organization (staffing and maintenance), and people  (patients and staff). Table 2 shows the witnessed and unwitnessed as well  as intrinsic and extrinsic falls. Environmental factors  included ambient environment, workplace envelope, personal workspace, and products. Products, as the most fre- quent type of environmental related fall, included 51%    (n = 42) of all environmental related falls, followed by  workspace envelope (37%, n = 31), ambient environment  (6%, n = 5), and personal workspace (6%, n = 5). The  subcategories of each environmental fall are provided in  Table 3. Table 1.  Fall Types and Related Level of Injury.

Locations noted in the sentinel event reports were categorized based on the levels of safety framework and  included corridors, dayrooms, patient rooms and bathrooms, admission and seclusion rooms. The content anal- ysis also expanded the framework to include transitional  and exterior areas including the front door entrance area,  patio space, and volleyball courts. An analysis of extrinsic factors showed that patient  rooms had the most fall occurrences with 39% (n = 107).  This was followed by patient bathrooms with 22%    (n = 59), dayroom or activity rooms with 20% (n = 55),  corridors with 8.5% (n = 23), and patios with 9% (n = 24).  The admission area included only two falls, quiet room,  and staff area each included only one fall event. Within patient rooms, out of 107 falls, 27% (n = 29)  were related to the environment, where products  accounted for 15% (n = 16), and workspace envelope,  ambient environment, and personal workspace accounted  for 6% (n = 7), 3% (n = 4), 1.8% (n = 2), respectively.  About 40% (n = 42) of falls occurring within patient  rooms were not witnessed by staff. Patient bathrooms accounted for the second highest  number of falls across all types of spaces in the psychiatric  hospital with total of 59 falls with 47% (n = 28) directly  referencing the physical environment. Unwitnessed falls  accounted for 50% (n = 30) of falls in the bathrooms.  Other fall categories occurred in the following order:  workspace envelope (24%, n = 14), products (17%,    n = 10), personal workspace (5%, n = 3), and ambient  environment (2%, n = 1). Dayrooms were the setting for the third highest frequent  falls with a total of 55 falls, out of which 25% (n = 14)  Table 3.  Falls Associated With the Physical Environment.

To show how these qualita- tive results relate to the SCOPE model’s factors, narrative  exemplars are provided in Table 5. Patient Rooms and Bathrooms According to the sentinel event narratives, there were  many cases of nighttime falls that implicated the physical  environment. Typical scenarios involved patients falling  while ambulating in their rooms at night. Inadequate lighting, tripping hazards, and the level of patient alertness all  contribute to this situation that supports ambient environment issues of concern described by the SCOPE model. Another frequent type of fall occurring in the patient  room was triggered by obstacles that cause patient tripping. Fall events relating to tripping over or sliding from  furniture happened in different situations when patients  were awake or asleep: laying down or getting in or out of  the bed. Falls in bathrooms presented a variety of environmental issues, including the layout, lack of grab bars, ADA  design, and reachable positioning of the fixtures. For  example, a narrative stated that a patient had reported that  when she attempted to sit on the toilet, the seat was lower  than what she expected, and there was no side rail on the  wall to offer support. Other complaints included difficulty in reaching the sink or the toilet to flush, which  resulted in patient fall and injury.   Flooring 6 7% were related to the environment. Most of the falls in this  category were associated with products that made 24%    (n = 13) of the total (n = 55), and one remaining case was  related to workspace envelope. Patios were the fourth most frequent location for falls  and accounted for a total of 24 falls where 42% (n = 10)  were environmental. Corridors were ranked as the fifth  place to host the most falls with a total of 23 falls (8.5%)  with only two cases related to the environment. The summaries of type of falls across different types of spaces are  provided in Table 4. Environment: Personal workspace 2 2%   Lack of/poorly positioned  permanent assistive devices 2 2% Environment: Products 17 20%   Furniture 5 6%   Slide from furniture 8 10%   Unstable/unmovable furniture 4 5% Total 83 100% Corridors Corridors represent shared/public spaces in a hospital frequented by patients. The sentinel event report excerpts  suggested a range of factors contributing to ambulating  events in the corridors, including wet floor that caused  falls or racing with other patients. In the case of wet flooring, some patients ambulated in recently cleaned areas  despite caution signage, which often resulted in slipping. Dayroom Sentinel event narratives revealed some falls in the dayroom are associated with furniture, such as chairs, tables,  and wheelchairs while getting up from a chair or seated in  a wheelchair. Sliding off furniture was one of the common ways of falling from chairs or wheelchairs, which  was more prevalent among elderly patients. Another hazard of falling occurred when patients tried to get up from  their chairs when table legs or chair legs were positioned  in the way. Table 4.  Fall Types by Space in Psychiatric Units.

For instance, a sentinel  event narrative reported that a patient fell during a group  walk by tripping over uneven concrete and landed on his  knees. Discussion Falls are one of the most critical patient safety concerns  in all hospital settings (Ulrich et  al., 2008), and this  includes psychiatric hospitals. The physical environment  has been recognized as a contributing factor to patient  falls constituting 9% to 16% of falls (Al-Khatib et al.,  2013). This study reviewed patterns of patient falls in  relation to the physical environment within the context of  a psychiatric hospital from a 7-year period of sentinel  event reports and contributes new insights regarding  environmental design factors related to inpatient falls in a  psychiatric hospital. Understanding the root cause of this phenomenon  calls for a close examination of all contributing factors.  However, a challenge to research on falls is the reality  that a large number of fall events in health care settings  are unwitnessed (Ward & Armitage, 2012). Unwitnessed  falls constituted more than half of the recorded fall cases  and were recorded based on self-report information by  patients. Unwitnessed falls data can raise concerns about  relative lack of staff knowledge pertaining to antecedent  environmental risk factors (Ward & Armitage, 2012). The  hospital under study revealed a fall rate of 2.3 to 6.9 per  1,000 patient days, a rate much lower than the rate of 13  to 25 per 1,000 patient days found in another study of  falls in psychiatric settings (Blair & Gruman, 2005). As  in the same study (Blair & Gruman, 2005), gender or time  of the day did not play a significant role in changing the  fall rate in our study. A critical concern derives from the  potential associated injuries that patients can sustain in  falls. However, the rate of falls resulting in an injury in  the current study was relatively lower compared with  other studies (Chan et al., 2013). It is not known whether  this can be attributed to the patient population in the present study, the physical environment, or other factors. The findings revealed that patient rooms and patient  bathrooms were the sites with the most frequent falls, followed by patios, dayrooms, and corridors. Although these  results support the five levels of safety model in terms of  frequency of falls in different locations, Chan et al. (2013)  found that among 145 psychiatric patients fall cases, corridors were the most frequent place where falls occur  (39.3%, n = 57), followed by patient rooms (26.9%, n = 39),  patient bathrooms (18.6%, n = 27), and the activity room  (6.9%, n = 10). Both studies did identify patient rooms  and bathrooms as a relatively frequent site of falls;  Table 5.  Instances of Categorizing the Sentinel Event Narratives. Fall type and description Sentinel event narrative Lighting and visibility at night Poor lighting Patient reported to this writer that she had got up in the night, not turning on the light and fell. Patient found on the floor after staff heard her yell for help. Patient stated she fell after  tripping over the edge of the bed. All the lights were out in the room and the door was  closed making the room totally dark. Patient came out of his room stating he had fallen. [patient] states he turned out his light and  was trying to find his bed and fell on the floor hitting his forehead and left arm. Furniture/fixture and difficulty with negotiating the physical environment   Furniture/fixture Patient claims to have fallen and hurt her nose when attempting to flush toilet. Head-to-toe  assessment performed by nurses and doctor without any notable trauma. Patient declined  any medication for pain.   Cords or tubing Patient climbed on top of the table below the TV and fell after attempting to plug in the cord  into the outlet and turn on the television. [patient] was found by the toppled table and  landed on her knees. [patient] was aided to her feet and she had no complaints of injury. No  apparent injury, vital signs were stable.   Furniture [Patient] was sitting in chair in day room and slide off chair. She said she was OK and declined  ice. Nurse was notified. Watched [patient] walk down hallway go into room. Five minutes later heard crash. Went in  to see [patient] on floor and chair turned over. [patient] was responsive and in no physical  distress. [patient] complained of dizziness, no sign of seizure. Toileting challenges in the bathroom and bedside   Doors in patient rooms not  open/out of the way (due to  spatial conflicts) Patient states he fell while attempting to enter the bathroom because the bathroom door got  in his way.   Lack of/poorly positioned  permanent assistive devices [Patient] was found in floor. She stated she was trying to get over rail to go to bathroom and  fell. [Patient] refused to allow staff to check for injuries. She stated she did not hurt herself. [Patient] went into bathroom on own using a rolling walker. [Patient] stated that when she  started to sit on the toilet she realized that the seat was too low and there was no side rail on  the wall and the sink was too far away for her to reach. Stated that she fell to the floor and  caught herself with the backs of her hands. Patient said she did not hit her head and only has  minimal pain on left hand. Patient was able to get herself up with the use of her walker, and  then patient came to nurses’ station to tell staff she had fallen and needed a higher toilet seat.   Bedside commode Patient fell from bedside commode in room when he leaned over to his right too much. He  was found on floor by nurse and suffered abrasions to end of nose and forehead. Assessed  by nurse-no serious injury . . . Dr. called. Patient was closely observed the rest of evening. Mobility limitations that compound environmental challenges   Environment: Products: Slide  from furniture Patient slid form wheelchair and was found sitting on the floor, in the doorway of her room.  She was assisted back into her wheelchair. Patient had no complaints of pain and no injuries  were observed. Family was notified, Doctor was notified.   Environment: Products:  Unstable/unmovable furniture Patient was attempting to get out of bed and the mattress went with him; both mattress and  patient ended on the floor. Patient was laying on bed propped up against wall, staff came in to do temperature, after  temperature was done, and staff turned around and was leaving room, when she heard  a bang. Staff turned around, saw bed pushed away from wall, and patient lying on ground  between wall and bed, with back to wall and holding his head. Inconclusive linkage with physical environment   Other ambulatory issues Patient came to nursing station and reported to me that while he was running on the patio  during a ball game he was unable to stop and ran into a wall. however, the findings diverged on the level of falls with  Chan et al. (2013) finding a greater number of falls in corridors as compared with the present study. It is difficult to  draw a firm conclusion based on these results. Differences  in the length of the corridors, traffic patterns with the  facilities, level of lighting and visibility as well as patient  demographics all may have influenced the results. What  is important to note is that the design and location of corridors and hallways can support ambulatory patients or  inadvertently create fall hazards. Patient Rooms and Bathrooms In patient rooms and bathrooms, the environment should  be viewed as an extrinsic factor contributing to falls  when there is inadequate lighting, a poor spatial layout  or ill-conceived adjacencies between the patient’s bedroom and bathroom. According to one of the sentinel  reports for instance, patients who want to use the bathroom in the middle of the night may be reluctant to walk  the distance required to go from their beds to the threshold of their room where the main light switch is located  to turn on the lights; instead, patients often walk to the  bathroom in darkness, risking a fall. The patient’s inability to easily control lighting complicates their function- ing and ability to perform regular activities that they  would have been able to do in a well-lit room. Poor lighting can increase the risk of falls (Vu, Weintraub, &  Rubenstein, 2004), and adequate lighting can benefit  special populations such as geriatric or disabled patients  (Lopez et al., 2010). In psychiatric settings, the majority  of falls occur when patients walk to the bathroom at  night (Tsai, Witte, Radunzel, & Keller, 1998). However,  there is not much evidence clarifying what level of lighting is considered “adequate” in such a setting (Gulwadi  & Calkins, 2008). In many of the sentinel event narratives, uneven flooring surfaces (i.e., in the transition between carpeting and  linoleum) or level changes (i.e., in the threshold between  sheet vinyl and tile flooring) were identified as problematic. Uneven flooring has been identified as a falling haz- ard in previous studies (Lopez et  al., 2010). Therefore,  both new flooring installations and repairs of existing  floors (e.g., retiling a sections of a flooring) call for careful  attention to ensure level flooring surfaces to alleviate falls. In this study, falls from the bed were the third highest  type of fall in patient rooms. For example, an unassisted  effort to sit up or get up from bed can result in slipping or  rolling off the bed, whether asleep or awake. The dangers  of falling when some patients try to get out of bed unassisted has been reported elsewhere (Lee, Mills, & Watts,  2012). Although efforts have been taken by hospital staff  to monitor such attempts by patients, another strategy  calls for minimizing the potential injury caused from  such falls by providing bedside mats that buffer these  potential accidents (Lee et  al., 2012). Other strategies  include specifying bedrails, bed heights, and bed alarms.  However, these options are not always fail-safe; for  example, some research on the use of bed rails in hospital  settings not only does not show a significant decline in  the frequency of falls, but ironically this design intervention may actually exacerbate the severity of the bed fall  injury (O’Keeffe, 2004). Lower bed heights were introduced as a patient safeguard by the Joint Commission  (2014) since a lower height enables patients to touch the  floor; however, a literature review conducted by Hignett  and Masud (2006) was unable to corroborate the influence of bed height on the frequency or severity of the fall.  Another strategy for reducing falls from beds is the use of  bed alarms. However, a study by Tideiksaar, Feiner, and  Maby (1993) found the use of bed alarms failed to identify any significant difference in fall frequency between  the control and intervention groups. Furthermore, staff, in  general, may not be supportive of bed alarms, which are  not considered easy-to-use or effective and consequently,  often are deactivated for extended periods of time in hospitals (Lopez et al., 2010). In the present study, handrails and grab bars contributed to some falls when they were reported by patients to  be inconveniently located or absent in key locations, such  as bathrooms. The absence of handrails has been relatively well-substantiated as being associated with fall  risks, especially for the elderly. This finding has been  established across context from residential settings  (Marshall et  al., 2005) to health care facilities (Lopez  et al., 2010). Unlike the somewhat inconclusive findings  regarding bed rails, bed heights, or bed alarms, the tactic  to install grab bars in accident-prone locations of facilities does seem to reduce the risk of falling. Yet it is impor- tant to be aware that even grab bars can pose hidden  dangers. For instance, a tragedy can result when grab bars  and bed rails lack anti-ligature features and thus become  an aid for suicide attempts. Finally, in this study, some bathroom falls appear to  have been caused, in part, by the overall layout of the  space, the height of the commode or sink, or the level  changes in flooring or thresholds. To help prevent accidents in bathroom areas, design solutions are called for  that consider commodes with easy access toilet seats that  facilitate the ability to sit down and get back up with  greater ease and safely and that have manual flushes at a  convenient height or alternatively implement automatic  flushes. Other narrative results describe the falls when  flooring is not adequately slip-resistant or cases where  tripping over the threshold between the bedroom and  bathroom becomes a problem. These extrinsic factors  become even more dangerous when the patient is medicated, causing increased drowsiness or dizziness. Corridors Few falls took place in corridors in this study. This may  be explained, in part, by the design of the hospital under  study. As corridors were relatively short and were surrounded by staff service areas, the length of time to get  from one area of the facility to another was shorted and  patient movement throughout most of the corridor could  be easily monitored. Overall, shorter corridors in conjunction with the positioning of staff areas seemed to  reduce patient falls in the hallways (see Figure 1). Other  researchers have advocated for shorter travel distances  for in-patient hospitals as an effective strategy in reducing falls among psychiatric patients (Lee et  al., 2012).  The length of a patient’s travel distance in the facility  influences the level of patient falls as does the layout of  spaces and overall size of the unit (Lee et al., 2012). Narratives pointed out that some patients use corridors  as a social space. In the hallways, patients can engage with  others, even racing from one end of the hall to the other.  Given the relatively narrow width of the corridors, a  patient who is walking very quickly may fall or even run  into another patient or staff member who, in turn, falls. Of  course, using the corridors for power walking or racing  can be dangerous and might signal the lack of adequate or  patient recreation. If psychiatric patients are discouraged  to spend time alone in their rooms and have limited opportunities for entertainment in a secured environment, it is  incumbent on caregivers and staff to provide places, other  than the corridors, for patient activities. Dayrooms Falls were relatively infrequent in dayrooms in this study  compared with other spaces. When falls were reported in  dayrooms, furniture often was the culprit as narrated in  sentinel event reports. Furniture placement could become  a tripping hazard; patients could slide off chairs or tumble  into a sharp edge; other times, patients fell over furniture,  slid from furniture, tumbled off furniture; in other cases,  patient falls while ambulating resulted from nonenvironmental factors, such as a seizure or the interaction  between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In short, falling is a complex issue, and fall prevention  does not lend itself to easy solutions. As found in this  study, the physical environment is only one factor contributing to falls and cannot be categorically separated  from human and organizational factors. Each fall event  may be an artifact of one or more contributing causes,  ranging from intrinsic human factors to extrinsic organizational and environmental influences. Although some  falls might have been most heavily influenced by a physiological condition, the root cause of other falls could be  traced to a combination of human, organizational, and  environmental factors at play. More research is called for  to explore the relative importance of these factors in association with typical patient fall scenarios. Limitations Although accessing the retrospective data provided an  invaluable opportunity to explore fall patterns over time,  the collected data did not allow for inferential statistical  analysis. Lack of information on patient treatment  approaches and medications did not allow for control of  related risk factors that played a role in patient falls. The  amount of time that patients spent in each type of space  and whether that had a role in the frequency of falls is  also unknown. At times, the sentinel event narratives  lacked more detailed information on environmental  design features that might have strengthened the results.  Therefore, the effects of environmental design on falls in  this study may have been underestimated. Furthermore,  the sentinel event reports may have somewhat misrepresented the location of the falls in the case of sentinel  events occurring with the dayrooms and adjacent corridors, given their adjacency. Specifically, in the hospital  under study, dayrooms were designed as relatively spacious areas that opened into the corridors and circulation  spaces. For this reason, some falls may have been designated as occurring in the dayroom instead of corridors or  vice versa. Another shortcoming of the study was that diagnostic  information on the total resident population was not  available. Since permission to access patients’ diagnosis  information was only limited to patients who fell (and  excluded those who did not fall), it was not possible to  correlate patient diagnoses and fall patterns. About 20%  of the sentinel events did not provide gender of patient,  which limited any conclusions drawn on gender. The collected data did not allow for identification of chronic fall- ers, who could have represented a disproportionate share  of falls. More importantly, data from a single case study  cannot be generalized to the population of psychiatric  hospitals; however, the issues raised on extrinsic fall  factors are important in directing further research. Conclusion Reducing patient falls and improving patient safety is essential in today’s health care system. Psychiatric patient falls are  greater in frequency and severity compared with other  patient populations. Although this may be partially due to  the use of psychotropic drugs, the environment appears to  play a role in the number of falls occurring and associated  patient injuries. The study findings can help inform decisions about the design of safer psychiatric hospitals.     There is little literature that specifically examines recreation or day room provision in an acute hospital – a topic not commonly researched by nurses. Some research has been carried out into hospital-built environments by nurses working with designers (Douglas and Douglas, 2004, 2005). There is one Cochrane review (Drahota et al., 2012), which reports various interventions aimed at improving patient experience (such as room type, furnishings, lighting and temperature). The authors concluded that while there is growing interest in the physical environment, there is limited evidence to “support or refute the implementation of physical changes” (Drahota et al., 2012, p. 2). In the UK, one hospital environment study reports from a patient perspective. While patients were not too concerned with physical appearance, they liked the hospital to be “patient-friendly” and wanted “something to occupy your mind during the day – a room to go to and have a sit and a drink”. Respondents also consistently reported that they had little to do in the hospital and became “fed up and bored” and suggested the “provision of recreational facilities both on the ward itself in terms of an afternoon entertainer, a library or social (tea) room and wider facilities across the site” (Douglas and Douglas, 2004, p. 65).

The highest satisfaction was related to café services, perhaps indicating their importance for in-patients. Interestingly, Douglas and Douglas’ (2004, 2005) studies concerned patients whose hospital stays were short (less than two weeks), so it is likely that dissatisfaction with recreation services is exacerbated if these patients spent longer periods hospitalised. Long-stay, older patients benefit from meaningful recreation activities and become “frustrated and disengaged” when these activities are lacking (Murphy et al., 2006, p. 2172). Irish studies exploring long-term older care facilities found that the physical environment and maintaining personal interests mattered to patients (Murphy et al., 2006, 2007). Ideally, patients in long-term care should have some exposure to their home recreation activities (Caulkins and Brush, 2009). Best practice suggests a designated area for physical activities, social interaction and family inclusion (Bowling, 2003; The Health Foundation, 2014). The literature supports, in principle, recreation services for all patients, but particularly those in long-term care. Patients have a requirement for a hospital environment that supports “homely normal lifestyle” and “privacy and dignity” (Douglas and Douglas, 2005, p. 268). The key reasons for carrying out quality improvement (QI) projects are to improve patient experiences and reduce hospital costs (Zoutman and Ford, 2017). Research indicates that hospital leadership and internal champions are important for successful QI projects (Draper et al., 2008; Zoutman and Ford, 2017) and nurses in particular, play a pivotal role in hospital QI projects (Draper et al., 2008). Involving users in the design process is imperative from the onset (van Bokhoven et al., 2003). Local context This QI project took place in a large city acute hospital. The hospital’s catchment area includes the inner city, with high unemployment, poverty and an aging population. The project focussed on a 28-bed medical ward, which cares for both elderly patients and patients with tuberculosis (TB). Respiratory precautions were adhered to at all times so there was no cross infection risk. Although the ward primarily provides acute nursing and medical services, over the past five to ten years there has been a steady increase (up to one third capacity) in patient numbers who may be considered “long-term occupants”, occupying the ward for weeks or months. There are two main reasons: elderly patients remaining in hospital awaiting suitable community services cannot be successfully discharged, although well enough, while supportive home care is unavailable; and the ward supports the hospitals’ TB service, which accepts complex referrals from treatment centres nationally. Despite TB’s low prevalence in Ireland (7/100,000) (Health Protection Surveillance Centre, 2017), there is an increasing complexity associated with treating TB, relating to addiction issues, homelessness and medication side effects. Also, people with multi-drug resistant TB may require a longer in-patient stay to manage and treat their disease. Many patients in this ward had longer stays than average acute medical admissions, and their needs were different from those experiencing shorter stays. As patients had no access to recreation facilities, they were confined to the space around their bed, had limited privacy and little stimulation. The ward was in a detached building, separated by a 15-min walk from the main hospital and its facilities, such as a coffee shop and prayer room. Patients had no access to a private sitting room and there were no recreation facilities or activities available to them. The idea for the intervention came about during an informal conversation between the Clinical Nurse Manager (CNM) and Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) about the time patients were spending sitting by their bed. During these conversations, the store room was identified as a space that could be refurbished for patient use. To progress their idea, the CNM and CNS sought approval for the refurbishment from colleagues in clinical management roles, including the Assistant Director of Nursing (ADON) and the Operations Manager. Staff from the planning department and technical services within the hospital also played a key role in this QI project. Frontline staff perceived that having no access to recreation facilities and space reduced service users’ quality of life and comfort. Staff believed that providing a recreation room in the ward could address this and identified the opportunity to improve the service through a formal QI project. 733 Hospital recreation room quality Quality improvement approach Once ethical approval for the project had been granted, nurses applied for funding to undertake the study, which aimed to explore long-term patient’s recreation and comfort needs and preferences in an acute hospital setting, implement the QI intervention to address those needs and preferences, and evaluate the outcome of the intervention. Project design QI is a formal process analysing performance and structured efforts aimed at improving it. The framework used in this service improvement was based on the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions programme: (1) capture patients and personnel experiences; (2) understand those experiences; (3) identify possible improvements; and (4) implement improvements (Andersson and Olheden, 2012). An exploratory quantitative approach, using a pre-test, post-test design was chosen for this QI project (Polit and Tatano Beck, 2014). The project was executed in three phases: (1) Phase I used self-completed questionnaires to explore patient, staff and visitor recreation and comfort needs and preferences in the ward. Data on patient activities prior to admission were also collected. All patients, visitors and staff in the 28-bed ward were invited to participate. This Phase fulfilled steps one to three as outlined above. (2) Phase II used the findings from Phase I to inform store room refurbishment, which was then introduced as a recreation room, fulfilling step 4. (3) Phase III evaluated patient, staff and visitor recreation and comfort needs and preferences after the designated recreation room was introduced. Again, all patients, visitors and staff were invited to participate. Data collection and analysis. Data were collected in two stages using self-completed questionnaires containing eight questions. Demographic information was gathered using three questions while five explored the activities that patients enjoyed prior to admission to hospital and while an in-patient. Questions about perceived barriers to undertaking these activities while in hospital, recreation desired and an open-ended question inviting comments were also included. The visitor and staff questionnaires contained five questions; they were not asked about recreation activities or perceived barriers to undertaking recreation activities. The question about the recreation and comfort desired, contained 21 items and was appropriately worded for each cohort, using a four-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Content and face validity, involving academic and healthcare staff, were conducted for each questionnaire. Patient and visitor questionnaires were pilot tested. Table I. Respondents 734 IJHCQA 32,4 g p q staff. The ward clerk also distributed a pack, including patient and visitor information leaflets and questionnaires to visitors who met the inclusion criteria. The visitor acted as an additional gatekeeper for the patient, which assured the team that patients and visitors did not feel coerced into taking part. Staff, visitors and patients returned their completed questionnaires to a designated post box located at the reception desk. Phase I data collection took place over six weeks in 2013. Phase III data collection took place over eight weeks in late 2014. The same questionnaires were used in both phases. Posters and leaflets were displayed in the ward during Phase I and Phase III to inform patients, staff and visitors about the project. All quantitative data were analysed using IBM (2013) SPSS Statistics version 22. Qualitative data provided in the open-ended question were analysed using content analysis (Vaismoradi et al., 2013). As Phase II involved structural building and design, this phase was managed by staff in the hospital’s Technical Services Department. The layout and design were informed by Phase I findings. This stage involved liaising with staff in the hospital technical services to get quotes and tenders for the building work. During the refurbishment, nurses regularly met the contractors and staff in the hospital planning department to ensure works were carried out to plan and adhered to hospital standards. Equipment donations were sought, and some new items were purchased. Advice on room colour scheme, decoration and furniture were informed through collaboration with colleagues from the hospital’s dementia and psychiatry services. The new recreation room. The new recreation room, measuring 9.0 m × 6.0 m, was officially opened in August 2014. A plain floor covering was chosen as it was suggested that one with spots or patterns could confuse patients with a cogitative impairment. A feature wall, soft purple in colour, was approved, creating warmth in the room. Window blinds in the same colour were hung. The room was furnished in three distinct areas. One area was furnished with a table and six chairs for patients and families to sit and chat or eat dinner. A couch (sofa) and coffee table were placed in another, with a bookcase holding books, CDs, games, jigsaws and radio were placed in the third area. Following consultation with colleagues from the hospital psychiatry services, old black and white images depicting famous locations were hung to create memories and encourage talking about past times. Finally, the room was decorated with artificial plants and side lamps, creating a homely atmosphere. Findings. There were 50 respondents (32 staff, 11 patients and 7 visitors) in Phase I. In Phase III, there were 27 respondents (17 staff, 5 patients and 5 visitors) (Table I). Just over two-thirds of respondents were female (67.5 per cent; pre-n ¼ 32, post-n ¼ 20). Patients were aged 20 to 91+ years. Visitors were 20–over 71 years old while staff ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. In the pre-refurbishment group, almost two-thirds (64.7 per cent; n % Pre-refurbishment Staff 32 64.0 Patient 11 22.0 Visitor 7 14.0 Total 50 100 Pots-refurbishment Staff 17 63.0 Patient 5 18.5 Visitor 5 18.5 Total 27 100 735 Hospital recreation room quality ) p y g p ( ) worked in the area for more than six years. In the post-refurbishment group, 60 per cent (n ¼ 6) of patients stayed between two and five weeks. Over half the staff (58.9 per cent; n ¼ 10) in this group had worked in the area for more than six years. Prior to admission, the top activities enjoyed by patients were watching TV or listening to the radio (100 per cent; n ¼ 11), meeting people (81.2 per cent; n ¼ 9) and listening to music (63.3 per cent; n ¼ 7). Not having a private space (54.5 per cent; n ¼ 6) and concerns about disturbing other patients (45.5 per cent; n ¼ 5) were identified as barriers to taking part in these activities while in hospital. Following refurbishment, over 90 per cent (n ¼ 24) of respondents agreed that there was a quiet space available “to go to chat and spend time with family and visitors”. Postrefurbishment, respondents believed that patients had more private space to meet visitors, doctors and nurses. They also indicated that there was adequate space for physical activity and a place in the ward where patients could be alone (Table II). To test if there were any significant differences between pre- and post-mean scores, statistical tests were conducted. Owing to the small sample sizes, the Mann–Whitney U test (non-parametric) was used, significance level was set at p ¼ 0.05. Results indicate statistical significance postrefurbishment for several statements (Table II). Comments (from the open-ended question) received from respondents prior to refurbishment highlighted the need for a private space that would benefit patients. Staff indicated that the space could be used for patients and families to meet in private with the multi-disciplinary team. Patients and visitors suggested some entertainment could be provided, with one patient suggesting that a “sing-along” once a week would be welcome. Post-refurbishment, staff stated that patients moved away from their bedside and interacted more with other patients. The room also provides a space for professionals to meet patients and their families. According to one multi-disciplinary team member, the room is considered a much-needed asset in the ward, contributing to patients’ quality of life and providing a positive element in their recovery. One staff member stated that: Patients seem to be happier and are able to chat to peers of their own age group […] a very positive thing for their recovery.

Key statements about recreational and comfort needs 736 IJHCQA 32,4 Reflections on the process. Reflecting on the entire process from, identifying needs, grant application and executing the intervention, nurses believe that any healthcare professional can make changes to enhance patient hospital experience. In their view, everyone is responsible for QI in the hospital and believe if determination exists, a shared vision and a passion for change, improvements for patients will follow. Team work, with like-minded individuals who shared their expertise coming together and supporting each other throughout the process, was essential in enabling this project to succeed. After the renovation, colleagues were amazed and surprised at the transformation and commented on the achievement. Both patients and visitors still remark on the room and the positive impact it has on their hospital stay and visits. Patients and families choose where to sit and chat and feel that they are not disturbing others. Often a patient can be seen having a nap on the couch (sofa) while another is having a cup of tea at the table. Challenges faced. Nurses faced three main challenges while implementing the intervention. First, funding was not available from within the hospital owing to financial constraints. The nurses were not deterred and made numerous funding applications to various external sources before a grant was awarded. Time allocation proved difficult for the CNM as she had to undertake multiple roles, including, refurbishment co-ordinator, project lead and researcher in addition to her duties as ward manager. Finally, at the time Phase III was being conducted, many in-patients had cognitive impairments and were unable to complete the survey. While they were using the recreation room, they were unable to provide feedback. In an attempt to overcome this challenge, data collection was extended to facilitate completing as many questionnaires as possible. Conclusions and practical implications There is little literature on providing recreational facilities for patients experiencing prolonged stays in acute hospitals. Ensuring quality care necessitates the requirement for a good quality of life for the patient. Identity, autonomy, physical and social environment, connectedness and meaningful activities are all key factors, which determine quality of life for patients in longstay settings (Murphy et al., 2007). The physical environment matters greatly in the patient’s quality of life. Patients experience better quality of life when the environment facilitates patients to retain and participate in activities designed around their interests (Murphy et al., 2006, 2007). McCormack et al. (2011) recommended that life for patients in a long-term care ward should be like the life they would choose to live at home. Murphy et al. (2007) found that physical environment affected patient privacy, while having no meaningful and purposeful activities resulted in patients becoming frustrated and disengaged. Maintaining dignity and a good quality of life is essential for the patient’s psychological wellbeing (Bowling, 2003; The Health Foundation, 2014). To ensure this is achieved, a designated area in a long-stay care ward was developed for physical activities, social interaction and family inclusion, which were positively received by patients, staff and families. While modern healthcare strives to shorten hospital stays for patients, many with complex health issues and co-morbidities must remain in hospital for considerable time. Findings from this project indicate that patients, visitors and staff found the in-hospital recreation room beneficial. The overall patient experience during their lengthy stay in the hospital was enhanced. According to Matthews (2010), involving patients in service improvement enables project teams to incorporate user needs and preferences into planning and design. This QI project involved both service users and service providers. The intervention was shaped and developed by knowledge gained through service user involvement. Throughout the refurbishment process, patient preferences were considered; for example, during the survey, patients reported that they enjoyed listening to music at home prior to admission, so a designated music area was provided in the room. Patients and visitors reported that they 737 Hospital recreation room quality p p y p p ; the recreation room provides this space. Douglas and Douglas (2005) suggest that good design, enables patients to have enough space to move around the ward, allowing privacy with both medical staff and family and visitors, supporting privacy and dignity. This project demonstrates how nursing staff at the clinical frontline can engage with patients and their families, listen to their needs and preferences and initiate QI projects that enhance patient hospital experience. Nurses play a pivotal role in QI projects (Draper et al., 2008). This intervention demonstrates that frontline staff who engage with their patients are best placed to identify and participate in QI projects that improve service user experiences. While this was a QI project in one ward in an acute hospital, the experience could inspire other environmental changes for other in-patients. We recommend surveying current service users to asses if the room continues to fulfil their needs. In keeping with ongoing dialogue with service users, survey results could assess if needs and preferences have changed. QI projects that are sustainable are associated with nurse leader involvement and staff engagement (Zoutman and Ford, 2017). Frontline staff play a key role in ensuring that the room continues to fulfil its function as a recreation facility through leadership and managing how the room is used. Limitations This was a small exploratory QI project in a specific setting and therefore findings cannot be generalised to other hospital settings. The sample sizes are relatively small; therefore, care needs to be taken in interpreting the results. However, as the project aimed to explore longstay patient recreation and comfort in an acute hospital and develop a specifically designated recreation room in a specific ward area, this limitation would have negligible effects. As Hackshaw (2008) indicates, well-designed small studies are acceptable once results are interpreted with care. Voluntary participation means that there is the potential for non-response bias. Owing to their medical condition, fewer patients than anticipated were able to take part in the post-refurbishment survey, limiting the patient voice; however, those that participated reviewed the intervention positively.     Fifteen million people experience a stroke around the world each year, and strokes are the second leading cause of disability [1]. According to the current evidence and international guidelines, care in a stroke unit should be the first choice for people who are experiencing the acute phase of a stroke. Care at stroke units reduces the risk of complications, disability and death [2]. A stroke unit is defined as an identifiable geographic area in hospitals that is devoted to people who have a stroke, and it is staffed by a multi-professional team with specialist knowledge of stroke care [3]. Multi-professional teamwork means that professionals from different disciplines benefit from each other’s skills and work towards common patient goals [4]. Teamwork has been shown to improve satisfaction with care [5] and the quality of care for persons with complex needs, such as the period after a stroke [6]. Regarding stroke care, several studies have described the benefits of multi-professional teams as a factor that contributes to the beneficial effects of care in a stroke unit, e.g. a reduced risk of complications and disability [3,6,7]. On an ideal stroke team, there is coordination and effective collaboration between various professions, such as nurses, physicians, physiotherapists, and occupa- tional therapists. The team should perform activities towards common goals and respect the shared responsibility of group efforts [8,9]. Teamwork was defined by Gharaveis, Hamilton and Patis [4, p.120], “as a behavioural process, wherein team members collectively accomplish specified goals efficiently and effectively in the context of one or more patient care objectives”. This way of working requires regular team meetings as well as assessments of the patient’s health status to create a coordinated care plan [3,10]. Given this background, it is understood that the multi-professional team is of significant importance for a high standard in healthcare. However, teamwork in stroke care is complex, demanding and highly varied in format, leadership style and team climate [11]. Table 1. Characteristics of the physical environment. The physical environment – observed environments Stroke Unit 1 (SU1) General description: Three corridors around a courtyard. A combination of multi-bedrooms and single rooms [23 beds], with all patient rooms facing the outside. Bathroom in the patient room. Therapy area placed on the same floor as the unit. Patient lounge/dining room placed at the entrance to the unit, and windows with daylight. Staff workplace: Constituted by both open workplaces/desks in the corridors and rooms with big windows facing the corridors [nurses and nurse assistants]. Separate workplaces for physicians, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Some of the workplaces had natural light from outside. Venues: Team meetings and/or team conferences took place in either a large seminar room on the ward or in a seminar room just outside the ward, both with a table in the centre. Regular team meetings were also held at the physicians’ workplaces, small rooms with a writing desk and chairs. Stroke Unit 2 (SU2) General description: Two corridors built at an angle. Mainly single rooms [22 beds]. Two multi-bedrooms reserved for acute patients [n ¼ 6] in need of medical monitoring. Bathroom in the patient room. Therapy area placed at the end of a corridor between two building complexes. Patient lounge/dining room placed in the middle of the unit with a large entrance. No windows in the lounge/dining room. Staff workplace: Constituted of both open workplaces/desks in the corridors and rooms with large windows facing the corridors [nurses and nurse assistants]. Separate workplaces for physicians, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. A workplace between the two multi-bedrooms facing both rooms with large windows. Venues: No specially designed rooms for team meetings or team conferences. All team meetings were held in a small room with a writing desk and chairs [the primary workplace for nurses and nurse assistants]. Stroke Unit 3 (SU3) General description: Two parallel corridors. Primarily single rooms [22 beds]. One room was reserved for acute patients [n ¼ 3] in need of medical monitoring. Bathroom in the patient room. Therapy area on the same floor as the unit. Patient lounge/dining room at the end of the corridor, with windows facing the outside. Staff workplaces: Placed along the corridors, with large windows facing the corridors. Separate workplaces for physicians, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Venues: Team meetings and/or team conferences took place in a large seminar room in the ward with a table in the centre. Earlier studies showed an association between the well-being of patients and staff at healthcare facilities and the design of the physical environment [12–15]. In stroke units, the physical environment has been described as essential for patient activities and care [16–18]. Changes in the physical environment have been found to influence patient activity and social interactions [16]. In a recent study, patients were found to have higher levels of activity in a stroke unit that had a combination of single and multi- bed room designs compared to a stroke unit with only a singleroom design [18]. However, the interplay between the physical environment of stroke units and multi-professional teamwork has rarely been investigated. Generally, efforts to make the environment supportive of patient needs must also consider the needs of the staff. For instance, the physical environment could include spaces designed to allow team members to work together, face to face, and to accommodate supplies nearby, such as rooms for medical products and storage facilities [4]. Ulrich et al. [13] found that the physical environment can contribute to staff stress, fatigue and ineffectiveness in delivering care, which may influence patient safety, health outcomes, and the overall quality of the healthcare. Recently, a systematic review [4] of the impact of a well-functioning physical environment on teamwork and communication dem- onstrated that both layout and spatial arrangement influenced all aspects of communication in healthcare facilities. To create a physical environment that supports positive health outcomes for patients and staff, decisions on design alternatives in the environment should be based on research. Evidence-based design has become the theoretical framework on which to base decisions about design to set up a physical environment that has positive health outcomes for patients and staff [19]. In an evidence-based design process, decisions about the design should be based on current evidence and experiences from existing healthcare environments [20]. This approach includes research about the needs of those working in the stroke units [19] and how the physical environment could be a facilitator or a barrier to the multi-professional team’s ability to provide high quality For effective and safe stroke care, the physical environment in modern stroke units should facilitate evidence-based care in which the multi-professional team has a central role. There is sparse knowledge as to how the physical environment impacts multi-professional teamwork in stroke units, although environmental factors are generally outlined as being important in terms of how staff can work within healthcare facilities. Aim and research questions The overall purpose of this study was to explore multi-professional teamwork and the physical environment in three newly built stroke units. This purpose was addressed using the following questions as a guide: a. To what extent are the team members working together during the day? b. In what location are the team members working together to care for the patients in the stroke unit? c. How does the physical environment impact the multi-professional teamwork? Materials and method Design The current work is part of a larger study in which different factors in the physical environment important for patients and staff in stroke units have been explored. For this study, an observational design was used to observe the multi-professional team- work and the physical environment in stroke units. A combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods was used in the data collection and analysis according to the basic principles from the Creswell and Plano Clark [21] model of a convergent parallel mixed design. This method refers to the different independent strands employed during data collection and analysis, followed by relational comparisons of the results during the overall interpretFigure 1. Schematic of the included stroke units. Figure 1. Continued. Study sites – the physical environment This study was conducted at one regional and two university hospitals in Sweden. One stroke unit was newly constructed [SU1] and two units were recently renovated with a new design [SU2 and SU3]. Their physical environment characteristics (Table 1) and design (Figure 1) somewhat differed. All the units had a combination of acute care and rehabilitation, and were built after the ratification of the Swedish stroke guidelines in 2009 [22], which are consistent with European stroke guidelines [3]. Participants In this study, the definition of the multi-professional team was based on the European stroke guidelines [3], i.e. a multi-professional stroke team consists of different healthcare professionals with special competence in stroke care. For this study, all the staff members of the multi-professional team in the included stroke units were eligible for inclusion. The participants were nurses, nurse assistants, occupational therapists, physicians, physiotherapists, and speech therapists. The team could work both as a team with two or more professionals together and as individuals during meetings with the patients. All patients included in the behavioural mapping were able to give informed consent, answer ques- tions and to perform some activities (e.g. stand, walk, eat, sit in the bed or sit out of bed). Data collection Data were collected through behavioural mapping [23] and semistructured observations from April 2013 to December 2015. The behavioural mapping and the semi-structured observations were performed at the same week at the included stroke units, but not at the same time. To provide a rich description of the physical environment (Table 1), examples from the included stroke units based on the semi-structured observation and examples from the planning and design documents were collected by the first author. [i] Behavioural mapping. While the patient’s activities and interactions were systematically observed and recorded using behav- in the multi-professional team, that were present during the observation were recorded, in addition to their location. The first and last author and two research assistants, trained and guided by a detailed manual in behavioural mapping procedures, performed all observations. For the behavioural mapping, each patient was observed over one weekday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Observations were recorded every 10 min on a previously defined route in the stroke unit, which remained consistent throughout the day. At each observation point, categories of physical activity [e.g. sitting, walking], the people present [e.g. physicians, nurses, family], and the location of the activity [e.g. bathroom, patient’s room, corridor] were recorded. When observing the people present, it was possible to note more than one member of the multi- professional team. [ii] Semi-structured observation. A semi-structured observation guide inspired by Spradley [24] was applied. The first and last author performed all the semi-structured observations. The guide included the location where the observation was performed, the design of the location, the description of the activity, who was involved, and the utilities and structure of the room. To capture the daily work of the multi-professional teams and their collaboration in the included units, a wide range of regular team-based activities were chosen for observations: stroke team meetings, daily activities at different workstations, and rounds and care planning meetings. The focus of the observations was on the ways in which the physical environment was a facilitator of or a barrier to the multi-professional team performing their activities. The duration of the observations ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 h. The first and last authors and a research assistant performed the observations. During the observations, field notes were taken. The field notes were both a description and a reflection of the facilitators and barriers in the physical environment, and the aim was to make them as complete and detailed as possible [25,26]. Data analysis To address the question (a) to what extent are the team members working together during the day, we examined behavioural mapping data and counted the number of observations when more Table 2. Examples of units of meaning, codes, sub-categories and categories. Unit of meaning Codes Sub-category Category “A room in the room. Open and closed to the patients. The workplace is visibly placed in the middle of the corridor. Patients and staff circulate around the workstation.” Easily accessible location. Centrally located. Workplaces are visible and accessible Centrally located workplaces are visible hubs during daily tasks. Further, to address the question of the location of teamwork (b), we also counted each episode and summary statistics are presented. Quantitative data in the form of behavioural mapping were analysed using descriptive statistics in Microsoft Excel 2016, and they are reported as the number of observations. To address the question (c) how the physical environment impacts the multi-professional teamwork, content analysis [27,28] was used to analyse the field notes from the semi-structured observations. In the analysis, the authors read through the field notes several times to obtain an overall impression and then started to select units of meaning for analysis. The next step in the analysis was an initial coding, followed by the identification of subcategories. The guiding research question for the coding was How does the physical environment impact the multi-professional team activities? The subcategories were then scrutinised by the members of the research team to identify similarities and differences, which were then organised into overarching categories (Table 2). These categories were further improved, resulting in the final three main categories. Discussions were held within the research group to reach a consensus. Ethical consideration A Regional Ethical Review Board approved the study. All the participants received verbal information on the study and gave informed consent prior to each observation. The data collectors were not employed by the participating units. Results The results are presented as the numbers of observations (Figure 2) and as descriptions of the activities observed from the field notes (Table 3). The behavioural mapping was based on 2970 observations, and the field notes were based on 56 semi-structured observations. Three main categories appeared in the quali- tative analyses: (i) the hub of the unit; (ii) division of places; and (iii) power imbalance. Team members and locations of the multi-professional team in the stroke units Observations taken when parts of the team [two or more professions] and the patient were interacting were low overall (Figure 2). These meetings mostly occurred in the patients’ rooms. During the majority of the observations, the most common team constellation was a nurse and a nurse assistant collaborating in a meet- ing with a patient. Few other constellations were observed. The physical environment and teamwork Main category 1: the hub of the unit The observations showed that centrally located workplaces patients’ rooms. They could differ in design, were all small and were often marked with different colours on the walls, pillars, and floors. Workplaces were either open desks where staff kept their documents or cubicles with space for 2–3 staff members. The staff members who worked at these workplaces were mostly nurses and nurse assistants. These workplaces signalled openness (i.e. staff availability) yet provided privacy. The open desks were accessible and clearly defined by different colours in the corridor. In contrast, the physically open desks made it difficult for staff to maintain confidentiality. During the observa- tions, patients often sat or walked around the workplaces. At one unit (SU1), there was full transparency into the workstation, in which all the documents on the tables and on the computer screens were visible to patients and relatives. The staff had to remember to log out of the computers and to avoid leaving any documents at the desk. During the observations, it was also noted that everything the staff talked about was audible in the corridor and in nearby patient rooms. Sometimes, the physicians and therapists [physiotherapists and occupational thera- pists] passed by to report on patient’s health status. During the observations, there were few signs of ongoing teamwork in which the professionals were meeting and discussed the care in the stroke units. Another type of workplace was the secluded workplace, with glass walls facing the corridor and with doors that could be closed (SU2 and SU3). Sometimes these workplaces had frosted glass, sometimes not. These workplaces enabled visibility, but the staff could choose to close the door, thus providing confidentiality. To facilitate planning and patient overviews [for all the professionals in the team], there were visible patient overview notice boards on the walls. At all the observed workplaces, these notice boards were visible to unauthorised persons [patients, relatives and other temporary visitors]. These secluded workplaces were used as rooms for the daily rounds but also for larger team conferences with all the professionals in the team present. During their use for the entire team’s meetings/conferences, these rooms seemed too small. It was difficult for all the team members to take part in the information exchange and the conversation. The air quickly became bad, and then the doors were opened, which in turn allowed people passing in the corridor to overhear the conversation, causing an unintended lack of confidentiality. Main category 2: division of places All the stroke units had a division of places, which meant that different professions had separate rooms. None of the stroke units had any places that were designed so that the entire multi-professional team could be together during their daily tasks. Instead, different workplaces were spread throughout the entire stroke units. In all the included units, a nurse station was located at one end of the corridor, and in the opposite end, there were rooms for the physiotherapists or the physicians. There were various spaces named as workplaces such as team 10 20 30 40 50 60 Bathroom Pa\u0002ent´s room Corridor Therapy area Pa\u0002ent lounge Physicians room Other (e.g., CT/MR/Echo) Team member combina\u0002ons Physician-Nurse* Nurse-Nurse assistants PT, OT and ST Nurses, Nurse assistants, PT, OT and ST Family and staﬀ Family and PT, OT and ST Figure 2.

The conference rooms create a clear hierarchy. Limited room with lack of communication. Private rooms and working techniques create participation. meeting and conference rooms. Even though a room was named a team station, it was often a workplace for nurses and nurse assistants for their documentation and administration work. Nurses, physicians, physiotherapists and occupational therapists all had individual rooms for their professions. In these rooms, care planning were performed. It was only during the special team meetings that the entire multi-professional team met and planned the care for the patients. In two of the included stroke units (SU1 and SU3), these team rounds were held in special seminar rooms with a table in the centre of the room. In one stroke unit (SU2), all the team meetings were held in one of the workMain category 3: power imbalance The observations showed that the design of the room could create a power imbalance between members in the team and between the team and the patient. Thus, the design appeared to impact the multi-professional team and their cooperation during team meetings and patient reviews. It appeared that the design was significant when it came to how work was conducted and how power was distributed. Meetings in small rooms (SU1) were headed by the member of staff whose room it was, and it was that person who determined what would be discussed, who could talk and how long the meeting would run. Since the small rooms were not intended for meetings, there were certain interruptions, such as extra chairs having to be brought in. Furthermore, the setting appeared to prevent the participation of all team members: for example, physicians spoke with their backs towards team members while accessing medical records, which was not conducive to face-to-face discussions. Some of the team meetings took place in specially designed conference or seminar rooms (SU1 and SU3), which allowed all members of the multi-professional team to gather around an oval or rectangular table and have face-to-face communication. In addition, rooms that were dedicated for team meetings made confi- dentiality possible. The seminar rooms in SU1 and SU3 were brightly coloured and had good lighting and ventilation: these seemed to be conducive to discussion. Designating a room for meetings enabled multi-professional teams to work without interruption, and the lack of visibility from the corridors was conducive to teamwork. When parts of the multi-professional team met patients during care planning, these meetings were also held in different conference rooms/meeting rooms (SU1, SU2 and SU3), with a proper table and chairs. During the care planning meetings, the patient was acting as the chairperson. In these situations, everyone was able to have eye contact with the patient. Discussion This study showed that the design of the physical environment could have an impact on the multi-professional teamwork in a stroke unit. The physical environment was not always designed based on existing evidence about factors considered to facilitate teamwork, e.g. a design that facilitates face-to-face communication and appropriate spaces to allow the members to work together [4]. This observations of the physical environment and the multi-professional teamwork should lead to careful consideration, since the importance of multi-professional team-based care and rehabilitation has been emphasised repeatedly in stroke guidelines [3,10,22] and acts as unequivocal evidence of improved outcomes [2,3,29]. Stroke teams are larger than many other healthcare teams and include a wide range of professionals, such as physicians, nurses, nurse assistants, and physio-occupational and speech therapists, so coordination and effective collaboration are important; however, this collaboration is reportedly difficult to accomplish [29]. Therefore, it is important to continue careful study of what it is in the environment that can contribute to teamwork facilitation. In the present study, despite the large number of observations, situations in which two or more members of the multi-professional team working together with the patient present were rarely observed. This result is worrying, because it is difficult to achieve a coordinated care plan for the patient if the team does not make a coherent assessment at the same time during the meeting with own care can be jeopardised if all team members do not attend the meeting. The relationship between professionals and patients requires communication structures that encourage patients to express their expectations, goals and preferences. At every patient meeting, patients must be regarded as partners in the team and be involved in the decision-making process about their care [30–32]. A recent systematic review of the benefit of single versus multi-bedroom design for persons with neurological disorders such as stroke did not find strong evidence to support or to refute single room design [33]. Based on the findings of our study it may be the case that when the multi-professional team works together with the patients, the single bedroom could be the best physical environment to enhance patient participation since it allows for a high level of confidentiality. Most commonly, a nurse and nurse assistant were observed together, and mostly in the patient’s room. This result is not surprising because nurses and nurse assistants have traditionally worked together bedside in care activities; they are also the largest professional groups and they participate in patient care 24 h a day [10]. Another explanation might be an undefined meaning of what teamwork should be in the units. Other research [11] has shown that teamwork can suffer if there is a lack of clarity in terms of work relationships and team interactions, especially if the physical environment is not designed for team interaction. This study shows the importance of the physical environment when it comes to face-to-face communication. Often, team members had to sit with their backs towards one another. In some cases, the rooms were small, and their primary function seemed to be as a workplace designed for 2–3 people. In a newly published review [4], visual connectivity and the size of a space, such as the presence of large rooms with space for all team members, was shown to strengthen communication between the team members. We also found that centrally placed visible workplaces acted as the hub of the unit. These hubs were placed in the middle of the corridors and were designed for communication and for short meetings with staff from the multi-professional team. The spatial relationship of a centrally placed workstation near the patient rooms has been shown to foster strong interactions and collaborative communication within the team [34]. Even if the hubs at the observed units seemed to be good places for communication, they were not appropriate for activities that required confidentiality. Open and visible workplaces can be important for facilitating communication and interactions, but it is simultaneously essential to secure confidentiality when sharing information about the patients. The results also showed that none of the included stroke units had any space for members of the multi-professional team to meet and work together as a team in a room that could be closed with a door. We could also observe that the various professionals had their own workplaces, i.e. there was a clear division between those different workplaces that appeared not to fully, support multi-professional team activities. Earlier research [9] showed that shared locations and professional proximity are necessary factors for successful teamwork, and co-location can render repeated engagement in sharing patient information and in exploring different perspectives [9]. Furthermore, a physical environment that is divided into different rooms for different professions can make team communication poor and incomplete. This finding is of particular importance since good communication is fundamental for safe care [35] and thus central for increasing patient safety [3]. For better communication, therefore, the physi.e. meeting rooms, e.g. being equipped with supporting technol- ogy and common workplaces. One important finding was the power imbalance in the physical environment. Sometimes, this power imbalance appeared to be emphasised by the design and placement of furniture. In these cases, the physical environment did not support team activities in which all the members of the team could participate and contribute to the care and rehabilitation of the patient. Previous studies have also indicated that the context in which a team meeting is held is important for the balance of power [4,11]. Tyson et al. [11] suggest that the physical environment and the ambient features can promote communication and a balance of power in a room, e.g. by using large seminar rooms with a table in the centre, a large space for each team member, a whiteboard on the wall and a large screen. However, having professionals working in the same physical environment does not automatically generate a team that will cooperate [36]. One factor that impacts teamwork can be hierarchies in healthcare. In a recent study by Green et al. [37], factors contributing to healthcare hierarchies included a person’s position within a team, e.g. professional speciality, sex, personality [introvert or extrovert], increased responsibility, orders within and between professions, and professionalism [37]. The importance of all these factors does not reduce the need to study the physical environment as an important factor in understanding how teams can work and communicate better. Rather, the physical environment can be part of the understanding of how the organisation and the environment interact to support team activities rather than hierarchies through a well-designed environment that promotes equal conversations. Strengths and limitations The results of this study were built on qualitative and quantitative data, with a large number of observations during full days, which strengthens the study. The research design and data collection was valuable because it provided the opportunity to address questions about complex phenomena such as the physical environment [38]. Another strength was that the observations were performed using a well-established method of behavioural mapping, and for the semi-structured observations, a predefined observation guide was used. To minimise the risk of unsought preconceptions, detailed field notes allowed us to reach a deeper understanding of the context of our observations. Field notes were valuable and prompted close observations of the environment and interactions. A limitation that should be acknowledged is that for the unstructured observations, there might have been informal meeting places for the team without the patient present that were not observed. Another limitation is that the behaviour mapping only provided a picture of who was with the patient in the patient’s room. There may have been occasions when the staff did work together – for example, outside the patient’s room, either with or without the patient present. Conclusion The design of the physical environment can play a significant role in multi-professional teamwork. The physical environment can support the multi-professional team by reinforcing good communication and power distribution. This design may include a shared workstation, allowing team members to meet and communicate face to face. It is time to understand and incorporate existing evithe physical environment of stroke units. Hence, the physical environment should be incorporated into stroke guidelines as an important component of stroke care.      Childbirth is an important life experience for women involving a number of interrelated psychological and physiological processes, which are influenced by the social, organizational and environmental context [1]. The woman’s overall birth experience is an important outcome of labor [2, 3]; the quality of this experience thus affects the future well-being and health of the woman and the baby, and the relationship with her partner [2, 4]. A positive birth experience is associated with long-lasting benefits for the woman, including improved self-esteem and empowerment important to her role as a new mother [1, 4, 5]. A negative birth experience, on the other hand, may have a lifelong psychological impact in the form of post-partum depression [6], PTSD symptoms [7], increased fear of childbirth [8] and possible impact on breastfeeding [9] and mother and child relationship [10]. The overall experience of childbirth is influenced by the course of labor, complications, pain experiences, support, sense of control, as well as the woman’s birth expectations [2, 4]. However, as argued by e.g. Fahy and Parratt [11], the physical birth- place and the delivery room play an important role in the woman’s birth experience. The shift of place of birth from home to hospital in most high- and middle-income countries means that the design of delivery rooms is generally dominated by a medical paradigm [12]. Such an environment for birth has been associated with both disempowerment and a lack of accommodation to women’s psychological needs [13]. Hospital design improvements have been shown to affect neurological and physical responses and to have the potential to alter patients’ state of mind [14]. The physical birth environment is known to affect the production and release of neurochemicals, such as oxytocin – a key mediator of social and emotional behavior [15], as well as the physiology of normal birth [13]. Women’s sense of safety and satisfaction with the birth experience may therefore be significantly influenced [16]. The world over, a variety of alternative maternity care settings have been designed to support normal labor and birth, as well as to stimulate more positive birth experiences. Organization models as well as care and staffing models vary greatly, but their differences notwithstanding, such alternative birth environments all aim to de- crease birthing mothers’ anxiety and promote mobility and personal control [12]. The alternative birth environments are therefore guided by a common philosophy that delivery rooms need not look like conventional hospital rooms [12]. Establishing a physical environment to support the women and their families’ activities could help them toward a caring, effective, and safe birth experience [12, 14], an attribute of more patient-centered healthcare practices [17]. In line with general recommendations [17, 18] patient-centered care is a marker of quality in maternity care and health service delivery in general, as this is documented to increase patient satisfaction. An alternative birth environment may minimize negative healthcare impacts and have a positive effect on women’s perception of patient-centered care and likewise on the ability to meet future generations’ needs for health and social care. An alternative delivery room inspired by the principles of healing architecture and Snoezelen was established in the Regional Hospital in Herning, Denmark, drawing on knowledge of how building and interior design affects the senses, including users’ pain experience and stress levels [12, 14, 19, 20]. The effect of the alternative delivery room on the maternal and perinatal birth outcomes was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) (To be published). This qualitative study is a separate but adjunct study to the RCT, and the objective was to gain deeper understandings of women’s experiences of the alternative birth environment and its ability to support the concept of patient-centeredness in the care of birthing women. The obtained knowledge may help health care managers, professionals, organizations, and management strengthen the quality of maternity healthcare. Methods Design Identifying the experiences of giving birth at the alternative delivery room from womens’ perspectives required a qualitative approach focusing on the lived experiences of women. The Hermeneutic phenomenological research method underpinned this study, as it attempts to unveil the world as experienced by the subject through their life world stories [21, 22]. The philosophical and methodical approach is refined by great scholars like Martin Heidegger and Hans George Gadamar [21, 22]. Research reality is perceived as individual constructions in response to different situations and the epistemology is grounded on the belief that it is possible to gain knowledge through subjective experience and insights [21]. Hermeneutic phenomenological research relies on reflection which is often mentioned as the researcher use of empathy or relevant prior experience as an aid to data analysis and/or interpretation of meanings [22]. This study was based on individual, semi-structured interviews with women who had given birth at the alternative delivery room. This design is often used when evaluation and deeper understanding of specific interventions in health care service are needed as it enables researchers to explore the experiences, intentions, and actions of the individual, as well as the impact of the experience [23]. Presuppositions and preunderstandings of researchers It is important for the researcher to be reflective about the ways in which their questions, methods and subject position might impact on data [22]. In this study, the researchers presuppositions and understandings of the phenomenon were colored by a shared background in the midwifery profession and based upon a fundamental belief that birth experiences can permeate women’s’ lives and that positivity in relation to labor and birth should be supported. This allowed the researchers to be open to the women’s experiences, and in interpretation of data, to pursue the methodological principles of the hermeneutic movement; awareness of one’s own understanding, putting one’s understanding into play and put themselves in someone else’s place [23]. The concept of patient-centered care Patient-centered care is seen as key to achieving quality in health care [14, 17, 18]. Drawing on Gerteis, EdgmanLevitan, and Daley [24], the data collection, analysis, and interpretation of data focused on the concept of patientcentered care, allowing for a comprehensive understand- ing of the women’s experiences to unfold. Reflection to which extent the data were supported or differed from the concept of Patient-centered care will be included in the discussion. The concept of Patient-centered care is widely used in different health care setting, and Gerteis, Edgman-Levitan, and Daley’s definition is visualized in Table 1 below. Setting The study setting was an obstetric unit at a regional hospital in Denmark caring for approximately 2500 births yearly. The alternative delivery room was opened in January 2015 [25]. As seen in Table 2, it differed from traditional birth environments on several parameters. Further information on the background of the alternative delivery room and the RCT can be found in the Study protocol for the RCT. Visualization of both the alternative delivery room and a standard delivery room in Denmark are also to be found here [25]. Participants and recruitment The women included in the RCT received both oral and written information to prepare them for the possibility that they might be approached for participation in interviews. The inclusion criteria of low risk women in the RCT, also applied to this adjunct study: Danish speaking, age above 18 years, nulliparous with a spontaneous onset of labor and a baby in a head-down position, and gestational age 37–42 + 0. We adapted a purposeful sampling strategy to identify and select information-rich cases and individuals especially knowledgeable about the phenomenon of interest [26]. In attempts to achieve a diverse sample which could allow us to identify important patterns across variations [26], we also looked at factors likely to affect women’s experience of labor and birth, e.g., age, marital status, educational background, and complications developed during labor and birth [27]. On this basis, 17 of the women included in the RCT who had given birth vaginally in the alternative delivery room were contacted by phone, and again informed about the study purpose, thus ensuring that participation in interviews was voluntary and based on fully informed consent. Fourteen women accepted the invitation (Table 3), all of them were Caucasian of origin and had their partners present during labor and birth. As the alternative delivery room is a part of the obstetric care unit, all women in this qualitative study gave birth in the alternative delivery room despite that some of the women experienced complications e.g. prolonged labor, post-partum bleeding, influenced heartrate of child and perineal injuries during birth. To allow time for physical and mental recuperation, the interviews were undertaken 3–7 weeks after birth. Offered the choice of interview setting, the women all opted for their own home. Data collection All 14 interviews were conducted by the first author between March and July 2016. An interview guide with open-ended questions aiming to explore the participants’ experience of giving birth in the alternative birth Table 1 Seven dimensions of patient-centered care, inspired by Gerteis, Edgman-Levitan, and Daley [24] Respecting patients’ values, preferences, and needs Subjective quality of life, needs, autonomy, and sense of well-being Physical comfort Pain management, activities, and hospital environment Coordination and integration of clinical care Clear delegation of responsibility, effective communication between health team members, and administrative and organizational support Transition and continuity Understanding of planning of care, supporting resources, and relevant information at discharge Information, communication, and education Giving women knowledge about and clear understanding of status, progress, prognosis, processes of care, and self-care options Emotional support and alleviation of fear and anxiety Relief of anxiety regarding care and treatment and impact on self and family Involvement of family and friends Support, accommodation, encouragement, and recognition of role and needs of family Table 2 Key characteristics of alternative and standard delivery rooms Alternative delivery room Danish standard delivery room Guiding focus of the physical birth environment Promoting feelings of well-being, freedom, and control.

Although the first interview was intended as a test of the interview guide, its data were included in the study material as the positive dynamics and the interviewee’s spontaneous descriptions of further perspectives and experiences gave no reason for changing the interview guide or further test interviews. Interviews were conducted until the point of saturation, which entails that interviews yield little new knowledge [28]. In general, the interviews allowed the interviewer to gain comprehensive insight into the women’s experiences. All inter- views were audio recorded. Data analyses The interviews were transcribed verbatim, as it enables a consistent presentation of the participant experiences [28]. The transcripts were imported into NVivo qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 11, 2010) for further analysis. For a deeper understanding of the empirical phenomena, we applied the integrated hermeneutical analytical strategy described by Dahlager and Fredslund, which included a four-step process, permitting the researcher’s preunderstandings to interact with the research process without compromising the data [23]. Even though hermeneutical analysis do not wish or consider it possible Table 3 Key characteristics of participants Woman Age Highest degree or educational level achieved Marital status Birth complications 1 27 Bachelor Married 2 24 Bachelor Cohabiting Yes 3 25 Bachelor Cohabiting 4 26 Bachelor Cohabiting 5 31 Master Cohabiting Yes 6 29 Upper secondary Cohabiting Yes 7 29 Master Cohabiting Yes 8 26 Bachelor Married Yes 9 25 Bachelor Cohabiting 10 28 Bachelor Married 11 25 Master Cohabiting 12 28 Upper secondary Cohabiting Yes 13 29 Bachelor Married Yes 14 28 Bachelor Cohabiting Yes for the researcher to be free of own preunderstanding in interpretation of empirical data, the first steps of this analytical strategy was phenomenologically inspired. This allowed the researcher to work with empirically sensitivity and focus on the appearance of the phenomena while gaining an overall first impression of the women’s experience in the reading of the transcribed interviews and while coding meaningful units [23]. After revision, these units were categorized by a single headline describing its essence and then organized thematically. A comprehensive and recontextualized understanding of the women’s experiences was then achieved through interpretation and reflec- tion on the themes. This was done while taking our own preunderstandings, the actual context, and the theoretical contributions into consideration [23]. Results Analysis The central meaning of the women’s experiences was analyzed and formulated into sub-themes and assembled into three main themes: Emotional support, Involvement of family and Physical comfort (Table 4). The concept of Patient-centered care was used to inform our analysis and the construction of the main themes. The three main themes and subthemes are shown below. Themes Emotional support Feeling welcome On the whole, women reported an immediate feeling of being welcome on first entering the delivery room. Typical of their experiences, a woman described her sense of emotional support: … I kind of felt ... love behind it. Yes, I thought, okay ... do they really put so much effort in for us coming here? It gave me a great feeling of being embraced … (Informant 10). When describing such feelings, the women made associations to a recognizable home-like environment. “Feeling welcome” appeared to be closely associated with the women’s experience of emotional support, comfort and the reduction of the stress and uncertainty experienced Table 4 Main themes, sub-themes Themes Sub-themes Emotional support Feeling welcome Midwife and room inseparability Involvement of partner Feeling equal A space for the partner Physical comfort Positive distractions Capturing the room in connection with admission for birth. None of the women in our study expressed experiences of stressful elements or limitations induced by spoken and unspoken rules governing the room. The physical environ- ment seemed to support the women’s experience of being a vital part of the organization they now entered, which is especially important if a patient-centered approach is to be supported [24]. Moreover, it seemed to make the women adapt easily to the room and to the transition from home to hospital. Midwife and room inseparability As in all low-risk births in Denmark, the care was led by a certified midwife, who attended to both medical and psychosocial care needs. All the participants received one-on-one care. The relationship with the midwife, and her ability to provide emotional support, appeared highly significant in all the women’s birth experiences. In most cases, a positive relationship was established between the midwife and the woman, and the experience of the environ- ment appeared to depend on both this relationship and the physical features. The data show that the women’s experiences of the physical environment was affected, amplified, and sometimes restricted by the quality of the relationship with the midwife. As the alternative birthing environment also seemed to influence the midwives’ practices and engagement with the couple, the effect of the midwife and the room appeared inseparable. Many of the women in our study emphasized the midwife’s ability to small talk in a way that involved their own life perspective and experience. This seemed to strengthen the relationship between the couple and the midwife, as it was interpreted as a sign of equality. For instance, one woman said: …Well, she wasn’t just sitting there writing, or only present when it was to do with the birth ... she could also talk about other things – that was super nice. Because it also makes her a little more human. It was simply amazing. There's nothing better than when people share a little bit of themselves. Because … it somehow calms you down – it really does … (Informant 12) The women gave examples of how the room and its audial and visual stimuli created opportunities for small talk and how they perceived this as calming. However, all the women in the study also expressed a need for guidance from the midwife, as they found themselves in unknown territory and overwhelmed by pain. One of the women spoke for many when describing her experience of such guidance: … and I really needed that (…) I remember staring intensely into her eyes. She was so good at keeping my gaze and helping with breathing and everything. I was like … you know, I just surrendered myself … (Informant 14) Our data indicate that in general the midwifes working in the alternative delivery room were successful in helping the women “surrender” themselves to the birth process and guide them into a sense of physical and psychological control. However, the amply spaced room and the physical facil- ities also facilitated another form of emotional support, as it allowed the midwife to retreat and offer a private space for the couple while remaining available to them. The women valued this occasional “professional retreat” for the opportunity it gave them to find strength through close connect- edness with their partner while maintaining a feeling of safety and being cared for. The following quote is typical: Really, the good thing was ... that she was there – and that she was there almost without us seeing her. Because she was sitting, like in a corner. (…) We could talk about all sorts of things (…) things she didn’t have to know. I think it was (…) we were really just – completely ourselves. And that was really the reason we felt as great as we did. (Informant 12) The possibility for midwives to change between closeness and respectful distance seemed to increase the women’s confidence in their own abilities and sense of control. One woman explained this as: I think she felt that I also could manage on my own … well I actually think it was such a good combination...She made it seem so natural so that we could feel we were the ones in charge…so we could feel comfortable.. yes well, it made me feel safe that I knew she was there anyway and that she was calm... it made me less stressful. (Informant 6) The opportunity to create privacy in an unobtrusive way provides a key example of how the room enabled the midwives to adapt to different situations. Moreover, the environment seemed, in the majority of cases, to support or preserve the midwives ‘ability to provide a sensitivity to individual variations which is essential in ensuring patients’ experience of emotional support [24]. However, for few women the overall birth experience was overshadowed by their experience of insufficient emotional support from the midwives. They reported poor communication and misinterpretation of their needs, which led to anxiety and feel- ings of powerlessness. For instance, one woman described her frustration as: I thought aren’t anyone going to help me? Is it not a Midwife’s job to say; Well then you take your breast and… There was NOTHING. I felt like the worst mother ever on earth ... I did not know how I was going to get her to breastfeed... and then I got afraid and you know... she was completely naked and s smooth. I felt so stupid…It ruined the whole experience of the birth for me. (Informant 4) This seemed to emphasize what is known in a patient centered approach, that if patients’ emotional needs are not met, their usual resilience and ability to cope with stressful situation can be compromised [24]. The birth environment thus seems to be subordinate to the woman–caregiver relationship in the women’s assessment of their birth experiences. Involvement of partner Feeling equal Overall, woman spoke positively about their partner’s role and found it very important for their own psychological state of mind during labor. They highly valued the opportunities offered by the room to interact with their partner in a natural, everyday manner. Many of them said it had promoted a sense of equality and strengthened the couple in working together, which they found had alleviated their anxiety. One woman’s description of the experience was typical: ... we were in there together, you know. It wasn’t all just about me … it was more like it was about both of us. When you’re sitting together, and I’m sitting the same way as him … not just lying in that damn bed. It makes a world of difference getting out of that bed. Because once you’re in it, you are a patient. And I didn’t feel like a patient when I walked around with him … or sat in that cushion area with him. You’re in it together. (Informant 8) Our data clearly indicate that the sofa bed was the key feature and a major asset of the room. Most of the women talked excitedly about its role in their overall experience, even though it varied whether they had used it before or after birth (no participant used it for the birth although this was also possible). The sofa bed facilitated physical contact between the woman and her partner and strengthened her experience of intimacy and closeness with the partner, which the women saw as stimulating for their sense of partnership. A typical comment was: … he was sitting right by my side on the sofa. I could feel his presence. He was … I could feel his legs ... it gave me a sense of security and tranquility. You know, we’re together in this, even if I’m doing the hard work. Anyway, having him alongside me, feeling him... was great for me. (Informant 13) Maintaining intimacy and being equal was key to the women’s general experience of a high level of psychosocial support from their partner. In interpretation of our data, it seems that the women and her partner, in their way of being together in the room, must have experienced the physical environment to signal, encourage and allowing the partner, in some degree, to be involved in the care for the woman during childbirth. This is considered an essential aspect of patient-centered care which supports a family-centered approach [24] and clearly of great meaning to the women. A space for the partner The women expressed consistent consideration of their partner’s well-being during labor. Again, the sofa bed was highly valued as it increased the comfort of the partner while offering both a physical and psychological “space”. The relaxing effect allowed them to withdraw for rest when needed. This contributed to reducing the women’s concerns and stress stemming from her concern for the partner’s wellbeing. One woman explained it this way: The corner made all the difference ... for the father too, and I actually felt that it was great for me as well. Because I felt like “Now I don’t have to worry about him”. I thought it was really nice ... because it means something. The person you’ve got with you in the room, you know, it’s someone you are extremely fond of … (Informant 12) The sofa area afforded the partner an occasional retreat and the couple a chance to relax individually and in different ways without being separated. The women thus felt that the partner was always present when needed. The women seemed to experience that the sofa bed was an explicit sign that the environment acknowledged partner’s needs, which also were experienced supportive to the women’s needs. Physical comfort Positive distractions For some of the women, the visual and auditory stimuli captured attention, which was helpful to their coping with labor and maintaining a sense of control. Several of the women described a feeling of being inside a bubble when coping with labor, as expressed by one woman: It was just really nice for me, you know – the peace in just watching that [the projected images]. Somehow, I'm just inside this bubble. It was ... I really felt like I was in a bubble. It really helped me keep myself going, you know, maintaining the relaxed state I wanted to achieve … and it also turned out to be really good for me. (Informant 8) Many of the women were able to recall their state of mind and body during labor, and they associated it with relaxation and joy. The stimuli elicited positive emotions in the birth environment, as they associated to important aspects of the couples’ daily lives. For instance, one woman said: … [the landscape images] made him recall his experiences hunting (…) He kind of liked watching it. So we talked a lot about that – also with the midwife ... it was really nice… (Informant 10) Many other distractions, such as childhood memories from the beach, were described by the women and their partners. Although they did not all enjoy such reminders of important aspects of their daily lives, they were all positive about the social interaction that the landscapes and sounds had given rise to. The majority of the women furthermore emphasized the positive effect of the room lighting. The following quote is typical: The light was so calming, I think. Like, there was no stress … you know, it was kind of more relaxing – a good feeling, with nothing to feel bad about, you know. We weren’t waiting, or afraid that something bad might happen, the way you might be in a hospital. (Informant 6) In general, the warm, dimmed light in the room contributed to the women’s sense of comfort and being in a safe environment. Overall, they used and perceived the light and the distractions very differently. While some of the women did not register the audial and visual distractions during labor, they still emphasized the overall positive contribution of these stimuli in creating an positive ambience. A few women found that the audial and visual distraction compromised their ability to relax. However, as the women and their partners were given control of the sound, light, and the projected landscapes according to their current needs, stressful situations were avoided. Regardless of initiative tacking in the physical environment to support physical comfort, safeguarding of the woman and her partner’s autonomy is therefore a significant environmental factor in the support a patient cen- tered approach. Capturing the room Many of the women were surprised to find that the ambience of the room gave them a sense of empowerment in actively and autonomously exploring the room and its facilities. A typical remark was: I kind of felt I had to try capture the room in some way. Instead of just sitting and watching ... all of a sudden, I found it quite exciting and it made me feel comfortable … (Informant 8) The tranquility and physical comfort provided by the room seemed to stimulate the women and their partners to move around freely to explore different spaces for relaxation and pain relief without feeling a need to ask the staff for permission or help. While many of the women found well-being in the bathtub, by walking around and adapting different positions close to their partner on the sofa bed, some also found the traditional hospital bed helpful. The environment seemed to support the recommendation in a patient centered approach to explicitly address and expand patients’ opportunity for individualcontrolled options for pain relief [24]. However, all women gave birth in the traditional hospital bed, even though many expressed that they would rather have been giving birth in the bathtub or on the sofa bed. Many factors may be causing this, however as the women did not know the reason behind the decision to give birth in the traditional hospital bed, this could suggest that exploration of possibilities for alternative birth positions and communication regarding this depends on the guiding of the midwife. Discussion A high level of patient-centered care is documented by the women’s predominantly positive perception of the alternative birth environment. Overall, our results therefore corroborate other research indicating that well- designed physical settings play an important role in making hospitals safer and more healing [12, 14, 29]. Our analysis has shown that women’s experiences of the physical environment in the alternative delivery room relates to several dimensions of the concept of patient centered care. Three main themes were developed: Emotional support, Involvement of family and Physical com- fort, and especially four key factors within the environment contributed to the high level of patientcentered care. Firstly, the ease of transition to the alternative and more home-like hospital setting seemed to strengthen the women’s experience of emotional as well as physical well-being. A possible explanation for this might be that comfortable and familiar environment is known to promote feelings of safety, confidence, and a sense of self and to have a strengthening effect on women’s physiological functioning and emotional well-being [11]. The environment therefore seemed to convey an atmosphere of dignity, respect, and sensitivity toward the women’s psychological needs, which are an essential element of patient centered care [24] and could be a facilitator of progress during birth [13]. Secondly, the women’s partners were also offered physical and psychological space by the room, hereby relieving the well-known worries of repercussions for rela- tives often experienced by patients [24]. As described by [13], sharing the experience of labor and birth with their partner is extremely important for most women. While the value of the partner’s presence and support for women’s birth experiences has been documented in other studies [30], it has also been suggested that this factor slows down the process of labor as women may find it harder to relax with her partner by her side [13]. However, in our study the women experienced the sofa bed as a significant feature supportive to relaxation of both the women and her partner. The experienced possibility offered by the facilities to their partners as providers of emotional and physical support during labor and birth was also of great importance to our informants. In order to support real involve- ment of families, this explicit encouragement within the environment of the family’s needs should however also entail health professional to seek a deeper exploration of the partners individually expressed needs [24]. The partners experience is however not within the scope of this study focusing on the women’s experience. Thirdly, most women found that the environment helped them obtain physical comfort and encouraged active behavior, which may offer psychological benefits in their coping with labor, relaxation, and feeling in control. As shown by Raynor and England [13], the progress of labor and birth is facilitated by having access to and control over a variety of ways of obtaining physical comfort during labor and birth. Literature has also described how psychological benefits of positive distractions helps people to attend to the stimuli rather than own discomfort and anxiety [14, 29, 31]. In our study women most women also found joy and relaxation in the positive distractions. However, most import- antly the autonomy offered with respect to these physical features avoided potential stressful situations. According to her needs, the women experienced that she overall was free to seek the support of her partner or the midwife, or to be left alone, a feature of patient-centered care which also is considered to offer protection of patients’ autonomy and promote family centered care [24]. Safeguarding of woman and partner’s autonomy is therefore a significant environmental factor, which also has been shown to support progress in labor [13] and should therefore advantageously be preserved and thought into future hospital settings and quality of care. Finally, the alternative delivery room overall appeared to elicit positive and supportive relationships between the couples and their midwife, enabling the midwives to explore and respect the women’s psychological needs, which seem to have amplified the women’s positive experiences of the birth environment. Our study thereby suggest that both the environment and midwives play an in important role in women achieving a physical comfort and a sense of control. This is also supported by studies, showing that women who trust the midwife’s ability to control labor tend to experience this as pain reducing; such factors are known to have neurobiological positive effects on natural birth [15, 32]. Even though the essential findings within the women’s experiences were found to be related to the three main themes mentioned above, other dimension of patient centered care are also indirectly represented in the women’s experience e.g. respecting patients values and needs, integration of care and information and communication. However, understandings of the dimension of transition and continuity were not found in interpretation of the women’s experiences. Strengths and limitations The individual, in-depth interviews with their thematic focus have produced rich data offering new insights into women’s experiences of birth in an alternative delivery room and its ability to support patient-centered care. Data saturation was achieved through the 14 interviews, which is in line with other authors reporting data saturation after twelve interviews [33]. We did however not fully achieve our aim for great variation in the study participants’ key characteristics, and thus in their perspec- tives and experiences. For instance, none of them was single or young mothers, born outside Denmark, or in a disadvantaged social position. Our sample does, however, closely reflect the characteristics of the women already enrolled in the RCT on medical birth outcomes, from which the informants were recruited. A greater variety among participant characteristics may have contributed to further data variety, and our finding may be less transferable to single women or women/couples with another cultural background or less advantageous life circumstances. Another potential limitation lies in the great professional and public interest in the alternative delivery room prior to the study, which may have influenced the women’s preunderstandings and expressed views. The interviewer addressed this by constant awareness and ensuring adequate depth of the interviews. Fur- thermore, the reflexivity of the interviewer’s role and preconception was discussed by the authors at all stages of the research process. What this study adds The findings have added to the evidence on the positive influence of hospital environment design on patients’ psychological and physical well-being and thereby the psychosocial outcomes of care. Our study furthermore offers new insights into how an alternative delivery room inspired by the principles of healing architecture and Snoezelen can help encourage service providers to deliver patient-centered care, on which many hospitals and health care institutions base their practices. Implications for practice Our findings support the use of the principles of healing architecture and Snoezelen in the development of evidence based birthing environments. We consider that they apply also to rooms used for preliminary examination. Special attention should be given to ensuring space for the woman’s partner, the couple’s physical and emotional interaction, and in upholding women’s autonomy in the use of facilities to increase relaxation and physical comfort. However, ensuring and maintaining one-on-one care appears to be crucial, as the women saw the midwife–couple relationship and the psychosocial support offered by the midwife as a key factor in their birth experience. Conclusion In general, the women were found to have had very positive experiences with giving birth in the alternative birth environment. The environment appeared to encompass several dimensions of the concept of patient- centered care. Overall, the physical environment accommodated many of the women’s individual, psychological needs, e.g. by facilitating easy transition to hospital which reduced stress and anxiety. The environment furthermore seemed to provide opportunities for physical comfort and relaxation, which helped the women cope and their sense of being in control. The women placed great emphasis on the ability of the alternative delivery room to support not only their own needs but also their partner’s. They likewise stressed the psychosocial support and the interaction with the partner. However, at- tention should be given to ensure and maintain one-onone care as the midwife’s psychosocial support appeared to be key to women’s birth experiences and inseparable from the alternative birth environment. All these factors appeared to be highly interdependent. Our findings thus support the development of patient-centered birth environments in future hospital design to promote the phys- ical and psychological wellbeing of the woman and her partner. Abbreviation RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial      There is widespread concern about the increase in intrapartum intervention rates, e.g. caesarean sections, and recent research and discussions have focused on the need for the appropriate use of medically indicated interventions (Miller et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2016). Medical interventions during birth have consequences for the health of the mother and child, in both the immediate and long term (as shown in the latest studies on epigenetics). In this article, the authors define intrapartum interventions as all interventions occurring from the onset of labor up to and including the expulsion of the placenta and membranes. Intrapartum interventions include, but are not limited to, the induction of labor, the use of intravenous oxytocin, artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes, epidural anesthesia, electronic fetal health rate monitoring, episiotomy, caesarean section. The reasons for the increase in intervention rates are multifactorial and in many circumstances unexplainable, as evidenced by the variation in rates within and between countries (Euro-Peristat, 2018). The rates may be influenced by the model of care adopted, the relation- ships between caregivers and the organizational culture, which is made up of many factors including the built environment. . . . increase in intervention rates are multifactorial The rates may be influenced by the model of care adopted, the relationships between caregivers and the organizational culture, which is made up of many factors including the built environment. The activities and relationships among users (a woman in labor, her supporter) and maternity healthcare providers (clinicians and staff) in the labor ward in hospital settings or during home births are contained within walls, and therefore within spaces of a certain shape, characterized by precise levels of illumination and the objects and equipment they contain. The knowledge base informing the built environment in healthcare facilities has grown rapidly in recent decades. The research findings demonstrate that the physical environment impacts users’ health outcomes and well-being, both positively and negatively, in different fields such as mental healthcare (Connellan et al., 2013), dementia care (Marquardt, Beueter, & Motzek, 2014), and pediatric care (Del Nord, 2006) and in different functional units of the hospital such as operating rooms (Joseph, Bayramzadeh, Zamani, & Rostenberg, 2017), intensive care units (Denham, Bushehri, & Lim, 2018), and wards (Rashid, 2015). The evidence indicates that well-designed hospitals are safer and promote healing in patients and are better for staff (Ulrich et al., 2008). The corollary of this is that poorly designed spaces are less safe, may cause harm or morbidity for users, and may be worse workplaces for staff. The term environment has different meanings in different disciplines and different research fields. In the context of environmental sociology (Catton & Dunlap, 1978), environmental psychology (Bonnes, Bonaiuto, & Lee, 2004), and environmental design (Lauria, 2017), the term points to the physical environment and its relationship to a person and their needs and feelings and to the social relationships among people. The term immediately poses an interdisciplinary and interscalar problem that has been accentuated over time by the complexity of the investigated phenomena. This has led to the inclusion in the concept of environment of every area of the anthropized environment and connoting aspects that cannot accurately be defined as physical (technologies, health status, wellness conditions, etc.). This article focuses, from an architectural perspective, on the physical environment as the built physical space where women undergo labor and birth. The authors specify the physical environment by using the term “building spaces” (Delany, 2015) which refers to single functional spatial units, their spatial relations (visibility, proximity, accessibility, and permeability), and the physical environmental characteristics that define them (dimensions, shape, topology, envelope walls, auditory, and lighting environmental surroundings). This article reviews the literature to determine whether the architectural factors and design features of the birth environment have an impact on intrapartum interventions, and if so, how this occurs. This article reviews the literature to determine whether the architectural factors and design features of the birth environment have an impact on intrapartum interventions, and if so, how this occurs. Method A scoping review of the topic was firstly conducted within the Scopus databases, Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals (EBSCO), and SAGE Journals in December 2017. The search strategy included the following key words: (“Birth Environment” OR “Birth Space” OR “Birth Design” OR “Birth Architecture”) OR (“Maternity Environment” OR “Maternity Space” OR “Maternity Design” OR “Maternity Architecture”) OR (“Midwifery Space” OR “Midwifery Design” OR “Midwifery Architecture”) OR (“Obstetric Environment”) AND (“Caesarean Section” OR “Intervention rates” OR “Birth Outcomes”). The search was limited to studies in the English or Italian language. Initially, 80 studies were found, 12 papers were further screened by title and abstract, and 4 were finally identified as relevant by reading the full text. The inclusion criteria adopted while reading the full text were as follows: (a) the paper must provide a clear description of the building spaces and (b) the text must describe whether the physical environment influences intervention rates or birth outcomes. Numerous articles referring to certain environmental qualities such as homelike, clinical, intimate, private, calm, and related psychological and functional effects were excluded as they did not meet Criteria (a), that is, they did not provide a clear description of the building spaces and this acted as important filter. Homelike is the term chosen to illustrate the following logic: if the authors specified or explained the spatial quality, for example, by saying “‘homelike’ decorative features including soft lighting, colored bedspread, floral curtains, carefully designed woo- den furniture, a wooden rocking chair and artwork on the walls” (Bowden, Sheehan, & Foureur, 2016, p. 74), the paper was included. If instead the term was attributed to a space but the authors did not state which specific element was able to confer this spatial quality, by providing a materially identifiable explanation, the paper was excluded. The dearth of literature retrieved from the search, the authors’ knowledge of healthcare architecture research, a review of the references of the included articles, and many of the papers that were discarded due to the absence of a direct connection between building spaces and intervention rates suggested the importance of looking for different kind of impacts, which finally led to the development of a broader perspective. The search then moved from seeking to understand the direct impacts of the physical environment on birth intervention rates to looking at how the physical characteristics of space might influence people’s behavior, experience, or practice. The rationale was that the physical environment of birthplaces has the potential to influence intrapartum interventions both directly (A) and indirectly (B) by influencing women’s and staff’s behaviors, experiences, and practices, which act as intermediate impacts (Figure 1). The figure illustrates that the indirect impact (B) is made up of the succession of two direct effects, both supported by the literature. The first effect is confirmed by studies on social and healthcare architecture. It is known that in these kinds of buildings, the physical environment plays an important role in determining stress levels, behaviors, and the care experience, and sometimes even the healing of patients (Codinhoto, Tzortzopoulos, Kagioglou, Aouad, & Cooper, 2009; Nickl-Weller & Nickl, 2013; Peponis, Zimring, & Choi, 1990; Ulrich, Berry, Quan, & Parish, 2010). The second direct effect has been reported in midwifery and obstetrics where users’ behavior, Figure 1. Conceptual model of direct (A) and indirect (B) influence of physical environment of birthplaces on intrapartum intervention rates. experiences, and practices have a direct impact on intrapartum intervention rates because they affect the physiological birth process. It is widely recognized that stress-related factors interfere with the physiological hormonal processes of women in labor (Buckley, 2005; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013) and consequently their experiences. Behaviors such as movement and the abil- ity to adopt upright birth positions can reduce the duration of labor, the risk of caesarean section, and the need for epidural anesthesia (Lawrence, Lewis, Hofmeyr, Dowswell, & Styles, 2013; Priddis, Dahlen, & Schmied, 2012). Moreover, midwives’ good practices foster the physiological progress of labor which leads to fewer interventions for women (Iannuzzi, 2016; Simkin & Ancheta, 2011; Walsh, 2012). . . . social and healthcare architecture. It is known that in these kinds of buildings, the physical environment plays an important role in determining stress levels, behaviors, and the care experience, and In reviewing the literature in light of these considerations, the research identified the physical elements of the birth environment that affect behavior, experience, and practice, that is those direct impacts that could function as mediators, namely, factors that later influence birth interventions and outcomes. Consequently, the new search strategy incorporated the use of the key words “behavior,” “experience,” and “practice” in the search matrix instead of the previous terms related to intervention rates. Database findings were screened by adopting the same procedures previously illustrated and the following inclusion criteria: The paper must provide a clear description of the building spaces and describe the influence of the physical environment on behavior, experience, or practice. Initially, 247 studies were found, 56 papers were then further screened by title and abstract, and 8 were finally identified as relevant by reading the full text. The systematic key word search was supplemented with additional manual searches of the refer- ences given in the included articles and related material identified through the active research network on the topic. A total of 37 studies (30 scientific articles, 3 book chapters, 2 research reports, 1 doctoral thesis, and 1 interview) met the inclusion criteria and were read and analyzed in depth. Results The findings were organized into three tables. Tables 1 and 2 report 32 of the selected studies, and Table 3 the remaining 5. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the selected studies and the building spaces that emerged as influential. These studies were mostly conducted in Western countries and employed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed design research methods. Table 2 illustrates in-depth description of the building spaces mentioned in the previous table and their impacts on behaviors, experiences, practices, and interventions. As shown in the last column, the main impacts were on women (28), midwives, or staff (8) and less frequently on those supporting women in labor (6). Table 3 outlines elements of building spaces that were shown to have an impact in documents setting out building design principles and recommendations. The five key architectural publica- tions analyzed were: (a) “Key design concepts” (Foureur & Hastie, 2008), written in collaboration with the architect Bianca Lepori, considers all the sensory modalities that could have a positive impact on physiological birth processes. The architect’s comparison of home and hospital birth spaces conducted by closely observing how women behaved in each place led to her to develop “Mindbodyspirit architecture” for birth theory (Lepori, 2008) drawing on an experiential approach to design. The framework of the theory can be identified in design principles based on the fact that all individuals experience space with at least three bodies: the moving, the feeling, and the dreaming one. (b) “Birthing Unit Design Guidelines” (Forbes, Foureur, Leap, & Homer, 2008), which proposes “optimal birth spaces” derived from a review of the literature, insights from surveys of women, and indepth interviews with midwives and archi- tects in health facility practices. (c) “Budset Design Principles” (Foureur, Leap, Davis, Forbes, & Homer, 2011) developed using a qualitative study including a literature review, interviews with key informants (architects, midwives, and researchers), and consultation with an expert panel. (d) “Evidence-based guide to birth environment design” (Jenkinson, Josey, & Kruske, 2014), a report proposing a BirthSpace guide based on findings from liter- ature reviews. (e) “La Casa di Maternita `” (Felli & Lauria, 2006), a book presenting guidelines for the design of maternity home facilities. Based on these sources, the physical components included in Table 3 were mostly identified for their performance rather than morphologicaldescriptive characteristics. The Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (Foureur et al., 2011) was used as a framework to organize and categorize the identified characteristics of the building spaces. Different information can be gleaned from Tables 1–3: Firstly, they provide some interesting data on the building spaces, they then differentiate between the type of impact these spaces pro- duce, and finally, a salutogenic approach emerges in many papers. The Building Spaces Tables 1 and 2 show that data on building spaces are limited and lacking in detailed descriptions, including the relative architectural plans. The design principles presented in Table 3 give a detailed description of the building spaces providing important clues for our investigation, although some important design aspects are not covered. However, despite these limitations, some physical elements are fully demonstrated and recur repeatedly. One example is the presence of a medical bed in the birth room which does not help the physiological process, or a bed that occupies the central space in the room (Bowden et al., 2016; Fahy & Parratt, 2006; Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lepori, 1994; McCourt, Rayment, Rance, & Sandall, 2016; Mondy, Fenwick, Leap, & Foureur, 2016; Walsh, 2006), or one that is visible (Hodnett, Stremler, Weston, & McKeever, 2009). Moreover, the bed is seen as being majorly responsible for layout inflexibility, thereby preventing midwives from finding the space to carry out tasks (Hammond, Foureur, & Homer, 2014). The literature included in this review and the architectural knowledge and experience of the authors led to the identification of eight building spaces that require further investigation: (1) unit layout configuration, (2) midwives’ hub/desk, (3) social room, (4) birth philosophy vectors, (5) configuration of the birth room, (6) dimension and 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 Figure 2. Different solutions of birth unit layout configuration. shape of the birth room, (7) filter, and (8) sensory elements. The relevance of building spaces is based on several factors. Some are currently unsupported by evidence (e.g., the position of the desk), some are found in the literature but their impacts are not proven (e.g., the unit layout configuration), and others recur repeatedly in papers but lack a clear description of their physical characteristics (e.g., the filter). Although the building spaces are analyzed and presented individually, some are closely related and interact with each other. The first three building spaces are related to the unit configuration, that is, the set of spatial relationships (permeability, accessibility, and visibility) between the rooms in a layout. For exam- ple, it is crucial to consider the birth room as a set of reciprocal relationships regulated by the distance, dimension, position, and connection of the room with respect to other spaces in the layout (corridors, social spaces, storages, midwife desks, and hubs). Unit layout configuration. The first building space that impacts how people live within the environment is the layout configuration (Figure 2). It dictates how the spaces are connected, their permeability, the number of doors between them and the visibility between rooms, and how these elements affect people’s movements and how they enter and exit the birth room and move within the unit. People’s movements within the unit are governed by different purposes: women need to walk during labor, midwives move between their work hub and the birth room, and the women’s supporters may require access to refreshments and to be able to rest in different areas. In order for women to identify their own place, the architect Bianca Lepori (2008) has underlined the importance of planned pathways, partitions, and sequences of spaces, while Longo and Setola (2009) have discussed the importance of space morphology (dimensions and layout) providing several uses for users. Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard (2008b) identified that the perceived spaciousness of the ward layout was directly related to increased user satisfaction and quality of care, and Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard (2008d) showed that the spatial layout enabled staff to perform their duties and pro- moted interaction among them. Ariadne Labs and MASS Design Group (2017) conducted a pioneering study showing how design elements influence clinical decision-making and identified quantitative layout data associated with the caesarean section rates of the analyzed case studies. Some of these design elements depend on the layout configuration. The analysis showed that the maximum distance between the various labor delivery rooms and the average distance of the nurse stations from the birth rooms are positively associated with the number of caesarean sections performed; the greater the distances, the higher the caesarean rate. The measure of this last distance is linked to the compactness of the layout and the proximity of the elements within it. In short, it is a configuration problem because the distance decreases if the rooms are grouped into clusters thus assuming a central rather than longitudinal conformation. Even the percentage of the unit circulation area accessible to users, another factor that Ariadne Labs and MASS Design Group (2017) suggest could be linked to the extent of medical treatments performed during Figure 3. Different positions of the midwives’ hub/desk and the birth rooms in the unit layout and a possible separation of hub and desk. labor and delivery is a configuration aspect: It makes a difference to a woman in labor if she is invited to walk along a corridor or can choose from alternative circular routes. Thesestudies reiteratethe importanceofthe layout but no specific or in-depth studies have been carried out on the most suitable morphology of the layout (e.g., circular or elongated) in relation to the care model, nor on the position that different rooms should occupy within the layout to facilitate optimal movements for users. Furthermore, no studies have yet been carried out in Labor Delivery (LD) units on how the careful design of the configuration in the environment allows for greater appropriation by the users who inhabit them (Penn, 2005). Layout configuration is important not only because it influences movement but also because it affects social interaction among people (Setola & Borgianni, 2016), a relational aspect of immense importance in labor and birth. Layout configuration is important not only because it influences movement but also because it affects social interaction among people (Setola & Borgianni, 2016), a relational aspect of immense importance in labor and birth. Intelligibility is the property of a layout that can be understood and therefore easily navigated by people. In the guidelines, the configuration aspect comes into play at the level of the unit’s intelligibility with respect to the point of arrival in the hospital (Forbesetal., 2008; Foureur et al., 2011). Midwives’ hub/desk. The strategic position of spaces like the midwives’ hub and desk may favor the relationship between women and midwives and among midwives themselves, as well as decrease stress and misconceptions in communication and practice among colleagues. For exam- ple, Berridge, Mackintosh, and Freeth (2010) talk about how the location of the midwives’ hub, in particular as regard its proximity to labor rooms, can affect communication and collaboration among staff. The authors have raised the question, without reaching definitive conclusions, of whether the hub and desk are better located in the same place or not. Conversely, Foureur et al. (2010) highlighted that a central desk facilitates positive communication, enabling the concepts of risk and safety to be explored. Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard (2008d) state that positioning the desk in the corridor does not help the staff as it leaves them exposed to noise and interruptions by users. When the desk is positioned close to the rooms, the distance between midwives and women is reduced, but staff interactions can be noisy and disruptive for the women (Foureur & Hastie, 2008). In summary, the best place to position the midwives’ hub and desk has been underexplored and is poorly understood. Further aspects need to be examined, for instance, the ideal number of them, whether the midwives’ desk and hub are considered tobe two different places or the same (this very much depends onthecaremodel),andtheiroptimumlocationinthe spatial layout in order to foster relationships and preserve the privacy of all users (Figure 3). Figure 4. Possible positions of social spaces in the layout in relation to the birth unit entrance. . . . the best place to position the midwives’ hub and desk has been underexplored . . . whether the midwives’ desk and hub are considered to be two different places or the same . . . and their optimum location in the spatial layout in order to foster relationships and preserve the privacy of all users (Figure 3). Social room. The presence and location of social spaces such as kitchens and/or a living room is a matter for further investigation. These spaces are perceived very positively by people and seem to have two main functions: facilitating relations between midwives, women, and supporters (Longo & Setola, 2009; Walsh, 2006) and providing a welcoming shared space, for instance, a “family room” (Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur et al., 2011), to accommodate supporters, thereby encouraging exchanges of experiences and providing them with a place of rest and support (Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Harte, Sheehan, Stewart, & Foureur, 2016; Jenkinson et al., 2014) in their positive role of assisting women during the labor and birth process. Therefore, the real role of this kind of space, the people who use them, the number of them, and their location in the spatial layout require further exploration (Figure 4). The presence and location of social spaces such as kitchens and/or a living room is a matter for further investigation. . . . facilitating relations between midwives, women, and supporters Birth philosophy vectors. In this article, vectors are defined as those elements designed to communicate information, such as posters, works of art, and images and writing on the walls of the unit and the birth room that convey a specific educational meaning related to childbirth and help to create an emotional atmosphere in the environment. This communication takes place on several levels. Harte, Sheehan, Stewart, and Foureur (2016) have shown that posters and brochures showing birth and physiological labor and birth support activities influence the instrumental and emotional needs of supporters. McCourt, Rayment, Rance, and Sandall (2016) describe how decorative changes in the environment can change the midwives’ practice, and Mondy, Fenwick, Leap, and Foureur (2016) present a large pinup board with photos and event notices as a shared space between women, their families, and midwives. In the guidelines (Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Foureur et al., 2011), use of the feminine archetype is suggested in artworks and symbols of beauty, wholeness, and harmony as they help to reduce women’s stress. Each vector conveys a meaning aimed to support the mood and wishes of the person who needs it at that moment. These vectors should be placed at strategic points for the users and integrated into the design of the unit (Figure 5). In addition to the previous four building spaces, another four concern the characteristics of the birth room, a space inhabited by mothers, midwives, and supporters. Configuration of the birth room. The birth room is a place where different activities occur at different times (Figure 6). It is used by women, their supporters, and midwives before, during, and after birth so the same environment must be capable of transforming itself accordingly. The solution the birth room should offer stakeholders does not just relate to the physical activities occurring during the intrapartum care process, but it also con- cerns users’ experiences, an awareness of “flexible definitions of normality” and “recognition of the ‘unique normality’ of each woman” (Downe & McCourt, 2008, p. 23). The birth room is a place where different activities occur at different times . . . so the same environment must be capable of transforming itself accordingly The birth room should be as flexible as possible and suited to different purposes. First of all, it should support the woman’s changing needs as she progresses through the different stages of labor and requires different atmospheres and settings to foster relaxation, distraction from the pain, and to create a more intimate birth space. Flexibility in the birth room configuration can contribute to a feeling of privacy and safety which, together with the ability to move around, Figure 5. Different type of birth philosophy vectors and their strategic position in the birth unit layout. are essential for women in labor (Franck & Lepori, 2007; Hammond, Homer, & Foureur, 2017; Igarashi, Wakita, Miyazaki, & Nakayama, 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013; Lepori, 1994; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013; Walsh, 2006) to support the physiological birth process. Flexibility withinthe roomcould beprovidedby the types of fixtures and modular furniture. For example, minimal fixed items and a movable bed allow individual women to express themselves (Foureur et al., 2011; Jenkinson et al., 2014). Creating ancillary spaces to store equipment near the room allows for flexibility in the use of different support materials (Forbes et al., 2008). The use of mobile furniture means the space can be configured differentlyandthishasan impactonthe womenand supporter’s sense of control (Harte et al., 2016). An inflexible andimpractical layoutalsohasa negative effecton midwives (Hammond et al.,2014) who, as a result, may not be able to support the women adequately. However, a number of unanswered questions remain and include the essential requirements of the furniture, the size and appearance of the intimate birth space, and, importantly, how to achieve such a level of flexibility within sometimes rigid hospital environments. Size and shape of the birth room. A very important element linked to the configuration of the birth room is the room size. Having an empty space or an empty and protected area in the room allows for freedom of movement and different birth positions and activities during labor and birth (Lepori, 1994). Being able to move freely during labor is important for positive birth outcomes (Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Hammond, 2015; Mondy et al., 2016; Rados, Kova ´cs, & Me `sza ´ros, 2015; Singh & Newburn, 2006). The room should be big enough to host supporters as well as the belongings of both the women and supporters (Jenkinson et al., 2014; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, & Dugard, 2008b), as this provides a welcoming feeling and the possibility of transforming the space into a familiar environment (Harte et al., 2016). In relation to birth room size, standards in some countries indicate that the minimum size should be 24 square meters (m2) or 258 square feet (ft2) without a pool and 34.5 m2 (371 ft2) with a pool Figure 6. Different ambiences in the same birth room. in the UK, 28 m2 (301 ft2) in Australia, 30 m2 (323 ft2) in the United States, and between 25 m2 (269 ft2) and 30 m2 (323 ft2) in Italy (AusHFG, 2016; Department of Health, 2013; FGI [Facility Guidelines Institute] 2018; Ispsel Guidelines, 2007). However, it is not known if this space is sufficient to facilitate women walking around and to allow for different configurations of furnishings. It is also essential for the birth room area to have the most suitable shape. A narrow, long room would not be appropriate to achieve flexibility, whereas a room with a more square shape probably would. Furthermore, the shape, favoring flexibility, also makes it possible to obtain the more intimate space many authors speak of, which is essential for childbirth (Figure 7). This space should evoke the concept of a nest, a cozy, and protected space in the room wherethewomanfeelsundisturbed,safe,andfocused on the changes taking place as the birth progresses, and therefore, the space allows the physiological process to proceed through “good hormone orches- tration” (Foureur et al., 2011; Hammond, 2015; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lothian, 2004; Odent, 2003; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013). For example, the morphology of a room with more convex angles naturally createsdifferentandintimatespaces.However,itmay be less flexible than a square room where the space can be altered and spatial situations created according to individual preferences (see Figure 6). . . . the shape, favoring flexibility, also makes it possible to obtain the more intimate space . . . which is essential for childbirth (Figure 7). In summary, the size of the room should be sufficient to facilitate women’s free movements and the shape of the room should offer maximum flexibility to facilitate individual women in reshaping their space. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether this inti- mate space represents the whole birth room and/ or a specific space, a corner, or a hidden and more private space within the same room. Filter. The interface between the birth room and the corridor is an important spatial filter that marks the transition between two different inhabited spaces, one more public, and the other more private. It is important to fully understand this physical element as it helps to favor a calm atmosphere and the concept of privacy (Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Jenkinson et al., 2014). In their study on birth room design elements, Shin, Maxwell, and Eshelman (2004) investigated the entrance transition to the room and found that this space, depending on how it is designed, relates to a feeling of hominess, a preference for using the space and women’s perception of personal control. The interface between the birth room and the corridor is an important spatial filter that marks the transition between two different inhabited spaces, one more public, and the other more private. The position of the door with respect to the internal configuration of the furnishings, such as a pool or bed, becomes an important element to check what can be seen from the inside and outside and provides users with an adequate level of privacy (Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Sheehy, Foureur, Catling-Paull, & Homer, 2011). This level of privacy can be obtained by taking simple precautions, for example, closing a curtain to obstruct the view of what happens in the room from the corridor. The filter, however, seems to encompass many more purposes: the transition from a corridor to a more calm and personal atmosphere, separation from all that is external, and proximity to points of contact with the midwives. In the literature, there are no descriptions of these aspects. Figure 8. Different type of interface (filter) between the birth room and the corridor. Figure 7. Different shapes of the birth room and the presence of intimate spaces created by a mobile furniture (a) or identified with the corner (b) of a room with a particular shape. The filter space could be of different dimensions and achieved in many ways, with furniture, fixed elements such as low walls, and even with the space that changes in itself creating indentations or small entrances, with lighting, and so on, depending on what level of permeability with external spaces is required and why (Figure 8). Sensory elements. All the sensory elements embedded in the space are important to create a calm and relaxing atmosphere in the unit and especially in the birth room: from the possibility of having natural and artificial dimmer lights to the colors of the walls and different touchable textural surfaces (Figure 9). According to many authors, the elements that affect our senses, such as light, noise, visual art, a view of nature, temperature control, warm colors, smells, and surface textures, all promote a relaxing atmosphere that reduces anxiety and stress and in turn facilitates normal birth and produces physiological benefits (Aburas, Pati, Casanova, & Adams, 2017; Balabanoff, 2016; Bowden et al., 2016; Carolan-Olah, Kruger, & Garvey-Graham, 2015; Duncan, 2011; Felli & Lauria, 2006; Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur & Hastie, 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Igarashi et al., 2014; Jenkinson et al., 2014; McCourt et al., 2016; Mondy et al., 2016; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, & Dugard, 2008c). Two studies detailed the characteristics of sensory environments. Hauck, Rivers, and Doherty (2008) found that the use of a snoezelen room during labor provided women with distraction, relaxation, comfort, control, and the choice of complementary therapy. Hodnett, Stremler, Figure 9. Different sensory elements creating a calm and relaxing atmosphere in the birth room. Weston, and McKeever (2009) compared an ambient room (a room with radical modification) with a normal labor room and found that there were positive childbirth outcomes for women who labored in the ambient room: They had a shorter labor and were less likely to need oxytocin infusions. A more recent experimental study conducted in Herning Hospital in Denmark investigated the use of a room with a 3-D projection on three walls designed to create an immersive environment, though the findings have not yet been published. In summary, although we understand the beneficial effect of this last group of elements on the birth process, little is known about which if any specific element has more impact and in what context. For example, it is not known if the dominant focus should be on projection, music, aromas, and moreover, the possibility of integrating them into birth room designs, from a cost competitiveness and technological perspective, remains poorly understood. The Impacts The impacts column of Tables 2 and 3 describes the physical, psychological, and physiological effects of the building spaces which can be organized into three categories: impacts on interven- tions, on users’ experiences and behaviors, and on staff practices. Impacts on interventions. This category includes papers that investigated how some building spaces are correlated to intervention rates in childbirth: for example, less frequently required epidural analgesia (Duncan,2011),the likelihoodofusing artificial oxytocin and shorter labor times (Hodnett et al., 2009), and the likelihood of having an emergency caesarean section (Singh & Newburn, 2006). This category also includes studies highlighting building spaces that facilitated normal birth (Carolan-Olah et al., 2015; Newburn & Singh, 2003; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard, 2008c), the physiological benefits (Fahy & Parrat, 2006; Foureur et al., 2011; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Sheehy et al., 2011), and promoted the physiologic hormone process (Lothian, 2004). Impacts on users’ experiences and behavior. The majority of studies analyzed reveal impacts on the experiences of women, midwives, and supporters. These include women’s sense of self (Fahy& Parrat, 2006; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013), the perception of personal control (Shin, Maxwell, & Eshelman, 2004), women’s distraction and relaxation (Aburas et al., 2017; Foureur et al., 2011; Hauck, Rivers, & Doherthy, 2008; Igarashi et al., 2014; Lepori, 2008), women’s perception of comfort and sense of wellbeing (Bowden et al., 2016; McCourt et al., 2016), lower levels of stress and anxiety in both staff and women (Forbes et al., 2008; Foureur et al., 2011; Hammond et al., 2017; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Rados et al., 2015; Stenglin & Foureur, 2013; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard, 2008c), midwives’ positive feelings (Hammond et al., 2014), and support- ers feeling welcome, privacy, and social interactions (Harte et al., 2016). Furthermore, other elements impact women’s behavior such as free movement, assuming different labor and birth positions and accomplishing different activities (Igarashi et al., 2014; Jenkinson et al., 2014; Lepori, 1994; Mondy et al., 2016; Walsh, 2006). Impact on staff practices. Some studies highlighted the influence of the physical environment on midwives’ practices through the impact on intrapro- fessional communication (Berridge, Mackintosh, & Freeth, 2010; Foureur et al., 2010) and on the ability to perform tasks comfortably and responsively (Hammond et al., 2014, 2017; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard, 2008d). Some studies highlighted the influence of the physical environment on midwives’ practices through the impact on intraprofessional communication (Berridge, Mackintosh, & Freeth, 2010; Foureur et al., 2010) and on the ability to perform tasks comfortably and responsively (Hammond et al., 2014, 2017; Symon, Paul, Butchart, Carr, and Dugard, 2008d). A Salutogenic Approach The approach suggested by some of the analyzed papers reveals a health orientation that aims to identify positive and negative impacts in order to create a path that favors physiological labor and birth. This argument refers to the salutogenesis concept, a theory originally developed by the medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky in the late 1970s, which is concerned with understanding what generates and maintains health and wellbeing (Perez-Botella, Downe, Meier-Magistretti, Lindstrom, & Berg, 2015). From this positive health perspective, understanding which spatial determinants maximize health and well-being for women, supporters, and staffoffersarchitecturethepotentialofcontributing to the understanding of pregnancy and childbirth as a health-producing processes (Downe, 2010). Thus, the challenge is to focus on space as an intrinsically positive resource for well-being and to find ways to develop assets for maternity, where the space forms an important contributing factor and, along with other factors, holds the key to a positive change in outcomes for women. Conclusions The research investigated the impacts of birth space characteristics on intrapartum maternity care, arriving at the definition of a conceptual model to better understand the direct and indirect influences of the physical environment. The effects of the physical environment can be found not only by studying intervention rates, which represented the initial purpose of the study, but also all the transitional/intermediate impacts (behavior, experience, and practice) elicited by the space which later influence intrapartum interventions. The research investigated the impacts of birth space characteristics on intrapartum maternity care, arriving at the definition of a conceptual model to better understand the direct and indirect influences of the physical environment. The effects of the physical environment can be found not only by studying intervention rates, which represented the initial purpose of the study, but also all the transitional/intermediate impacts (behavior, experience, and practice) elicited by the space which later influence intrapartum interventions. The reviewed articles, limited to circumscribed and different birth contexts (mainly Eur- opean, Australian, and American), have highlighted aspects that are desirable to stakeholders but that should be contextualized in the care model, culture, and health of every single woman. The complexity and versatility of the building spaces identified should be further under- stood through the contribution of several disciplines, including architecture, midwifery, and anthropology to enhance the meaning of each building space, provide knowledge about its nature, and stimulate the creativity of architects to find the most appropriate architectural solutions. The research shows the importance of considering environment design in maternity care and that even some existing studies not focused on this topic provide evidence of specific building spaces. The extrapolation of that data presents the existing studies in a manageable way to address specific research focused on architectural design in order to enrich our knowledge of what works well for women in childbirth, their supporters, and caregivers. It also helps to expand on the evidence to demonstrate the effect that the physical environment design has on birth outcomes and finally to develop accurate recommendations for designers. Implications for Practice \u0002 This article scientifically connects the built environment, birth outcomes, building occupants experiences, behaviors, and satisfaction. \u0002 It shows that the physical environment affects childbirth outcomes in direct and indirect way. \u0002 It describes in detail the physical space factors having impact on women, midwives, partner’s health, and well-being. \u0002 It informs the practitioner about the implications of the unit configuration and birth room design in maternity care      In recent years, led by healthcare design, designers have made efforts to create environments based on research into human behavior in the built environment with the aim of improving well-being and comfort (Center for Healthcare Design, 2008; Hamilton, 2003; Hamilton and Watkins, 2009; Martin, 2009). This evidence-based design (EBD) can be defined as “the process of basing decisions about the built environment on credible research to achieve the best possible outcome” (Center for Health Design, 2008). EBD has been a persuasive factor in justifying funding projects in the healthcare industry (Hamilton, 2003; Martin, 2009). Like healthcare, education is an area with limited resources that would benefit from an EBD approach to ensure that funds go to the design of schools that support proven educational strategies (Martin, 2009). This approach could particularly benefit children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person’s ability to socially interact with other people and to act in generally accepted ways of behavior (APA, 2013). The need to support children with ASD is pressing – current estimates are that 1:59 children have the diagnosis, an upward trend (Baio et al., 2018). Among other difficulties, children with ASD face unique sensory challenges in the environment that affects their behavior (APA, 2013; Dunn, 2008; Whitaker, 2001). Children can be hypersensitive and react to external stimuli that children without ASD may not notice, e.g., smell, noise, or the texture of The author would like to thank her Doctoral Advisor, Dr Barbara Martinson, Professor, University of Minnesota. Archnet-IJAR: International Journal of Architectural Research Vol. 13 No. 1, 2019 pp. 25-38 © Emerald Publishing Limited 2631-6862 DOI 10.1108/ARCH-12-2018-0029 26 ARCH 13,1 an item of clothing (APA, 2013; Dunn, 2008; NIMH, 2008). Conversely, children can be hyposensitive with a high tolerance level and not react to external stimuli that children without ASD normally would, e.g., they may be immune to pain when they injure themselves (Dunn, 2008; NIMH, 2008). Some children can be hypersensitive to some stimuli but hyposensitive to others (Dunn, 2008). According to the APA (2013), the hyper- or hyposensitivity that children with ASD experience is due “to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment” (p. 50). Despite this knowledge that the environment affects children with ASD, there has been little EBD research conducted to investigate the factors that impact them. There have been studies concerning the design of schools for children with ASD, but few have been experimental. An experiment is defined as research in which participants are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups (Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias, 2008). Several researchers have adopted a design criteria/checklist approach, sending a questionnaire to caregivers and educators to establish their requirements for an environment that supports children with ASD, and evaluating the responses via a hierarchy of importance (Khare and Mullick, 2008; McAllister, 2010; Mostafa, 2008). Others have taken a case study approach (Pauli, 2006; Scott, 2009). Mostafa (2008) undertook one of the few experimental approaches investigating classroom layout and acoustics and their effect on children with ASD. However, the study has been noted to have limitations since participants were not randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (Henry, 2011a). The design of schools that are appropriate to meet children’s needs is essential to maximize their learning potential (Vaughan, 2011). Legislation in the USA dictates that children with disabilities should be educated in the same school environment as children without disabilities if it meets their needs (Individuals with Disabilities Act, 2004). Many children with ASD are therefore taught in the same school environment with their peers, children without ASD (Simpson et al., 2008). However, most school environments have not been designed to suit the unique sensory challenges that many children with ASD experience. Several authors have expressed surprise that little research is available to inform designers how to create supportive environments for them (Henry, 2011a, b; Khare, 2010; Martin, 2014; Shabha and Gaines, 2011; Vázquez and Torres, 2013). Research that does exist is sometimes flawed in methodology, lacking rigor or anecdotal in origin (Henry, 2012; Martin, 2014). Moreover, knowledge can be difficult for designers to find (Scott, 2009) and is often “fragmented and inconclusive” (Shabha and Gaines, 2011, p. 228). If more rigorous research concerning designing schools for children with ASD were conducted, published, and made available to designers in an accessible format it could guide them to create supportive educational environments based on empirical evidence (Martin, 2014). This study aimed to address the lack of EBD research by conducting an experiment in a school environment with children with ASD and documenting the process as a model that other researchers could apply to similar studies. The study focused on wayfinding, a topic that has not previously been studied in relation to children with ASD, although it can be a particular issue affecting them (Baumers and Heylighen, 2010; Gerland, 1997; Higashida, 2013). The results of that study are not part of this paper – this paper focuses on the process of carrying out EBD research with children with ASD that could be applied to wayfinding or other experiments in a school environment. The steps taken to complete the study are outlined below. 2. Method: setting up the experiment This exploratory experimental study aimed to find out whether children with ASD could find their way around a school corridor more easily with the application of wayfinding aids compared to the control group finding their way around the same corridor without the addition of wayfinding aids. 27 Evidence-based design 2.1 Institutional approval The first challenge, particularly with vulnerable children with disabilities, was obtaining institutional approval. The university Institutional Review Board (IRB) required school district (SD) approval before they would consider an application. In selecting a suitable SD, the number of potential subjects was considered. The SD selected reported a high incidence of students with ASD among their students with disabilities (19 percent when the state incidence was 13 percent), and a doubling in the number of children diagnosed over a six-year period. An initial approach was made to the SD to discuss research possibilities before a formal application was submitted outlining study purpose and methodology, together with the copies of consent forms and data collection instruments. It proved difficult to finalize these documents, over 20 of them, when the research was still at an early stage. Several months of negotiation followed requiring much revision of documents before approval was granted. To protect participants, SD approval included a requirement for the researcher to sign a confidentiality agreement, to apply to become a student teacher, which entailed a criminal background check; and to hire and pay for a teaching assistant to monitor children in the study. Once SD approval was received, the proposal was submitted to the IRB. The IRB required some amendments necessitating further negotiation with the SD. The approval process was therefore lengthy to satisfy the requirements of both organizations. 2.2 Study location Another challenge conducting wayfinding research with children with ASD in a school was finding a route they were not familiar with as this knowledge could confound the study. Transporting children with ASD to an unfamiliar school not only has logistical implications, but also children often react adversely to unfamiliar environments which could disrupt the study. The research, therefore, took place during the SD Summer Program. This voluntary program ran for five consecutive weeks at select school sites and was intended to prevent children slipping behind educationally compared to if they did no studying during the Summer recess. The advantages were that high numbers of potential participants with ASD were likely to attend who were unfamiliar with the layout of that particular school. In the Summer prior to the experiment, the researcher observed a typical Summer Program class for children with ASD at an elementary school and concluded it would be a suitable location to run the study the following year. School approvals. Research in a school involves more than the participants and researcher. In this study, there were additional personnel whose cooperation and assistance were needed and sought. To inform affected SD staff about the study, several presentations were made to Special Education staff and educators who would be teaching at the Summer Program. This ensured that all staff understood the aims of the research and would cooperate with it. Approval for application of wayfinding aids was also required. The study aimed to test whether colored doors, colored shapes on the floor and colored signage could help children with ASD navigate along the school corridors. A meeting was held with the SD Director of Buildings to discuss potential materials that could be applied as wayfinding aids. Criteria for consideration were that they had to be temporary, easy to apply, cost effective, available in a variety of colors and would not damage existing surfaces. Matboard was selected as the best material to manufacture door and floor wayfinding aids, laminated paper for signage. A meeting was also convened with the head teacher of the selected school to explain the study and request the cooperation of janitorial staff. This was important because the school 28 ARCH 13,1 was scheduled to be deep cleaned during the summer recess, a common occurrence and the study would impact this process. A subsequent meeting was held with the janitor supervisor to explain the study, agree a suitable location and seek cooperation that the wayfinding route would be clear of janitors and equipment during the experiment as any interruption could affect the results. 2.3 Uncontrolled variables (typical school corridor) In order to keep the experiment as natural as possible, existing variables found in a typical school corridor were not controlled but data were collected to inform future studies. The main corridors measured approximately 12 feet 6 inches wide overall with a suspended ceiling throughout of 8 feet 10 inches height, consisting of 2 × 2 sq. feet white acoustic tiles in a lay-in exposed grid frame. Luminaires were mounted on the ceilings, comprising fluorescent lamps covered with Perspex baffles approximately 10× 4 sq. feet. Above the library counter was an elaborate lightwell enhanced by strip lighting which was lit during the study. Lighting levels in the corridors were generally uniform except for lower levels outside the music rooms. All corridors were internal so amount of daylight was not a factor. Doors were generally the same throughout the study site, average 34 inch wide× 82 inch height, finished in plastic laminate with satin anodized aluminum hardware. Classroom doors had rectangular vision panels. The predominant colors throughout the study site were beige walls and floors, blue lockers and door frames, and pink doors. Walls in the main corridors were clad in concrete tiles. Floors were a vinyl finish. Existing display materials, e.g., posters, pictures, were retained as typical distractions encountered by children when wayfinding in a school. There were also a number of distinct artifacts retained in the Media Center, e.g., presidential portraits and two United States flags. 2.4 Controlled variables The aim of this experiment was to find out whether a combination of wayfinding aids would help children with ASD navigate more easily around the school corridor. Aids were selected that would be easy to apply to a new build school or during refurbishment of an existing school. Controlled variables included the wayfinding aids (colored doors, colored flooring and colored signage), the wayfinding route, wayfinding scripts and researcher interactions. These are described in more detail below. Wayfinding route. The Summer Program took place in a designated area of the school and the remainder was cordoned off, including the area set aside for the study. A single route was identified from a designated start point to a destination point, a classroom designated as an Art Room, somewhere students might visit during a typical school day (see Figure 1). This provided a purposeful destination for the wayfinding task – participants had to collect a book from the Art Room. The destination was out of sight of the starting point. The route had opportunities to take right and left turns and to go in the wrong direction. Two sets of doors had to be opened along the route. The distance was approx. 483 feet. The presence of others using the wayfinding route was also a controlled variable. To enable optimum data collection, the study site was prohibited to staff and non-participant children and janitorial staff avoided it. This helped participants concentrate on the wayfinding task and ensured timing was not affected by human obstruction. Wayfinding aids. As stated, matboard was selected to make colored door templates. Detailed dimensions were taken of the doors along the route, including location and size of vision panels, door handles, closers, left and right hand openings, etc. Matboard was available in various sizes but a manageable size was 40 inch × 34 inch. Since the average door in the corridor was 82 inch×36 inch, two pieces of matboard were needed to cover each door. The matboard supplier agreed to deliver the large quantities required for the study direct to Figure 1. Plan of wayfinding aids for treatment group 29 Evidence-based design 30 ARCH 13,1 the researcher’s home instead of to a retailer as usual. Matboard was cut to size using a wall-mounted guillotine and final adjustments made on site. Templates were labeled so they could be easily located and applied. To fix the matboard, various products were tested. Blue decorator’s tape was selected as it was easy to apply and did not damage existing door surfaces when removed. After several adherence tests, a system was developed of using multiple pieces of tape applied to the reverse of the matboard, adhering the matboard to the door, then wiping the surface of the matboard with a cloth to firmly adhere. Using this system, all templates remained in position during the study. Matboard was also selected to create colored shapes on the floor as the low profile was not a tripping hazard when tested and the color matched the door aids providing a uniform color scheme. The existing floor had 2 inch × 2 inch blue contrast squares at regular intervals along the corridor length. These were covered with colored matboard as wayfinding aids so the existing floor did not cause confusion. At junctions in the corridor, larger 3×3 sq. feet colored squares were inserted into the floors and these were also covered with matboard squares taped together as wayfinding aids. The study also wanted to test whether different shapes on the floor had an effect so, in one area, 2 feet 8 inches diameter circles were applied over existing squares, cut to size with a laser cutter. Matboard was loose laid since it was relatively heavy and, when tested, stayed in place well. In addition to colored doors and floor shapes, colored signs were applied as wayfinding aids. Existing signage in the corridor consisted of proprietary plastic signs in burgundy color with white tactile raised characters in upper case. These were fixed at approx. 60 inches from finished floor level, generally positioned by the opening door hand. Most signs consisted of a room name and letter/number and some had additional labels, e.g. teacher’s name. The sequence of letters/numbers was confusing so signage was streamlined to make it more understandable and child friendly. This approach would also test whether clearer signage would aid participants in the treatment group. Some rooms were renamed to make them more understandable, e.g., “Inter. Music” became “Music Store” and a door labeled “No occupancy permitted by order of the Fire Marshal” was replaced with a simple “No Entry.” This approach represented how, in a new school design, there would be opportunity to provide clear signage. In the control group, the sign for the classroom designated art room was covered by a color-printed sign that matched existing signage so it would be perceived the same. Signs were created in the Word program, printed on 11 × 7 sq. inches colored paper matched to the matboard. Pictograms were included on the signs, important since children with ASD are often taught using pictures to supplement the written word. Some schools use pictograms from a recognized graphic symbol system but, since the SD in the study did not, free images were sourced from Google images. Signs were laminated to ensure robustness and applied over existing signs with concealed blue decorator’s tape. Regarding colors of wayfinding aids, the existing color palette of the corridor was beige walls/floors, blue lockers/door frames and pink doors. Colors of wayfinding aids were selected that would contrast with the existing scheme so they would be visibly perceived (see Figure 2). Orange, yellow, red and green were selected. Most matboard colors were available in bright chroma which stood out against existing colors but green was only available in a muted tone. Wayfinding scripts. The study was designed that participants would be shown ;the way first then asked to find it themselves. This was on the basis that, in class, instructions are often repeated numerous times to children with ASD to reinforce learning. This approach also followed previous studies (Cornell et al., 1989; Helvacioğlu and Olguntürk, 2011). To provide consistent instructions to participants, comparable wayfinding scripts were developed. In the scripts, the terms right and left were not used in case some children were Source: Author (2017) Figure 2. Examples of wayfinding aids for treatment group 31 Evidence-based design unsure which was which and it caused confusion. Instead, the terms “this way” and “that way” were used, enforced by hand gestures. At the start point of the study route, all participants were told, “First, I am going to lead the way to the Art Room. I’ll show you things along the way to help us find the way there. Then I’ll lead us back here to the start point. Next, I will ask you to lead the way to the Art Room. Try to remember what you see along the corridor to help you find your way there when you are leading.” This script was based on similar research studies (Cornell et al., 1989; Helvacioğlu and Olguntürk, 2011). Some doors and features were not referred to avoid information overload. During the first stage of the experiment, participants in both groups were pointed out select wayfinding cues on the way to the destination point and reminded of their task, a technique employed by Cornell et al. (1989). Examples of wayfinding aids pointed out to the treatment group included, “Notice there are two orange doors here”; “We are going to turn here and go through these big yellow doors into the Media Center”; and, “There’s another door here and a sign Media Work Room 2 and the same picture of someone working at a desk.” Participants in the control group were given similar instructions, e.g., “Notice there are two doors here”; “We are going to turn here and go through these big doors into the Media Center”; and, “There’s another door here.” Colors on the floor were not referred to in the control group to avoid misleading since the same color throughout meant the floors all looked the same. On the way back, participants in the treatment group were reminded about some of the wayfinding cues, for example, “Now, we are heading back to the start point. We are starting off in this green hallway”; “Remember these three red doors with the red signs to do with music”; and, “There is the yellow door with the yellow No Entry sign on the door that we passed earlier.” Participants in the control group were given similar instructions, such as, “Now we are heading back to the start point. We are starting off in this hallway”; “Remember these three doors?”; and “There is the door with the sign on the door.” During the second stage of the test, all participants were told, “Now we have arrived back here at our Start Point. Now you are going to lead us back the same way to the Art Room.” Participants were reassured that the researcher would be right behind them, that they could ask her for help if they did not know the way, and that the researcher knew the way so they would not get lost. Contingency comments were prepared in case a participant seemed unsure of the route, such as, “Do you need some help?” or “Do you remember which way to go now?” 32 ARCH 13,1 (Cornell et al., 1992). If a participant walked for ten steps or more in the wrong direction, or appeared confused, or tried to enter the wrong door, they would be instructed they were going the wrong way and asked to try again. Circumstances in which to terminate participation in the study were also considered, e.g., if a child became upset or refused to take part. The researcher, in delivering scripts, interviewing and generally directing participants, became a human variable that needed to be controlled. To ensure that a reliable, consistent stimulus was provided to all participants, the researcher practiced the delivery of scripts. The researcher wore the same plain black clothes throughout the study so her attire would not distract from colors in the corridor. This also disguised the video camera worn throughout the study on a chest strap. The researcher also wore plain black footwear so her shoes would not be a distraction as they had been to several children in the pre-study period! The researcher was also careful not to wear perfume which could disturb participants sensitive to smell. Prior to the study, the researcher had spent time in participants’ classrooms so they would become familiar with her and to enable her to observe their behaviors and interactions during class activities to frame their actions during the wayfinding task. Teachers read prepared scripts to introduce the researcher who also read a story to each class so participants became familiar with her unusual accent. Participants were generally observed for a minimum of 1 h on at least one occasion. 3. Method: running the experiment 3.1 Selection of participants The number of potential participants was estimated at 20 based on attendance data from the previous year’s Summer Program. In considering logistics, available resources, time constraints, and availability of participants, smaller sample sizes are acceptable (Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias, 2008; Sommer and Sommer, 2002), particularly since this was an exploratory study and the results were not intended to be generalized to the rest of the population (Babbie, 2010; Sommer and Sommer, 2002). Participants were screened by the SD using a screening criterion. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be identified by the SD as having a documented diagnosis of ASD. The age range of participants was selected as 8–11 years because, at that age, children were more likely to have greater maturity and ability to follow instructions, and provide their opinion, than younger children. This was especially necessary as gaining a direct feedback via a post-study interview was an important aim of the research. It was therefore important that participants could communicate verbally in simple words or sentences: children who were non-verbal were therefore excluded. To be eligible for the study, participants also had to be able to follow simple instructions and accompany the researcher for the duration of the study. This suggests a higher intellectual/cognitive functioning level as children with a lower functioning level may not have comprehended the instructions. Prospective participants were excluded from the study if they attended the school during the normal school year as their prior knowledge and familiarity with the study site could confound the study. Participants’ level of familiarity was further identified via a pre-study questionnaire to parents/guardians asking whether their child had previously visited the school, e.g., with a sibling. Prospective participants were also ineligible to take part in the study if they had an indicator on record that they were prone to challenging behavior or physical disruption as this could impact their ability to take part in a safe manner. 3.2 Informed consent Consents were itemized separately so that parents/guardians were clear what they were consenting to and could opt in or out of an item if they chose, including consent for the child to participate, to be videotaped, to be audiotaped, and for the SD to disclose 33 Evidence-based design demographic information to the researcher. A pre-study questionnaire asked for information about the child’s familiarity with the study site. Parents/guardians were also offered an optional opportunity to attend an informational meeting to meet the researcher and find out more about the study (the meeting was held but no one attended). To avoid the potential for bias, detailed aims of the study were not provided. This guarded against what Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias (2008) describe as “demand characteristics” (p. 199), where people who take part in a study act in a way they think the researcher desires. The child was also asked to agree to take part in the study via a Child Assent Form. Parents/guardians were asked to review the form with their child to help them understand that they were being asked to take part in a fun study with a researcher from the university that involved walking around the school. 3.3 Demographic data Parents/guardians were asked to consent for the SD to release demographic data to the researcher: all parents/guardians agreed. Both male and female participants were sampled, but selection was expected to reflect the gender difference in ASD, where more boys than girls are diagnosed on a ratio of 5:1 (Baio et al., 2012). The primary language used by participants was noted. This was relevant since participants whose primary language was not English could have more difficulty understanding the researcher and reading signage. The ethnicity of participants was also documented as there are reports of a high incidence of ASD in some populations, e.g., the Somali population (Hewitt et al., 2013). Motor functioning abilities were recorded as this could affect time taken for the participant to complete the study. Sensory impairments were also noted which could impact the study, e.g., participants with vision impairment could take more time carrying out the wayfinding task. Participants were screened for color blindness: any with blue monochromacy color deficiency, a total lack of color vision, would be excluded since they would be unable to perceive the colored wayfinding aids. Participants with red–green or blue–yellow color deficiency would be retained as they were likely to be able to discriminate the colors. 3.4 Recruitment of participants Shortly after student participation in the Summer Program had been confirmed, the SD used the screening criteria to identify potential participants. Recruitment packs were distributed to parents/guardians by the SD on behalf of the researcher along with the key information about the Summer Program on the basis that the study information would be more likely to be read. Recruitment packs contained an informational letter, consent forms, a pre-study questionnaire and a stamped addressed envelope to the researcher. A follow-up letter was sent to non-responders via their child attending the Summer Program. Due to slow response, a $20 gift card was offered to encourage participation, retrospectively applied to those who had already agreed. In total, 22 recruitment letters were sent out in which 9 participants were recruited. 3.5 Assignment to groups Participants were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group to avoid selecting participants who could be predisposed to one condition or the other which could bias the results (Babbie, 2010; Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias, 2008). Both groups took part in a wayfinding experiment along the same route in the school corridor, the control group under the existing conditions and the treatment group using wayfinding aids applied as an intervention. Teachers and parents/guardians were primed with a note of dates to remind the child they would be taking part in a fun activity with a 34 ARCH 13,1 researcher from the university to encourage the child and diffuse anxiety. These reminders worked well in that all participants went willingly with the researcher, most excited to take part. 3.6 Time schedule The Summer Program ran for five weeks, Monday–Friday, for 3 h each morning. Week 1 was designated a settling in period and pre-testing; Week 2, the pre-study observation period; Weeks 3 and 4, the experiment was run. Two typically developing children (convenience samples) were recruited to test the control and wayfinding route in the pre-test period. Typically, developing children were used because there were a limited number of participants with ASD who would be needed for the study. Also, participants with ASD were more likely to behave in unique ways so may not have provided a balanced view. From the pretest feedback, adjustments were made to the study procedures. Due to the complexity of fitting the wayfinding aids, time order for the study was: run participants in the control group, install wayfinding aids, run participants in the treatment group, remove wayfinding aids. Participants were randomly allocated a 1-h time slot to take part in the study, from collection to returning to class, although, in the field, most participants finished sooner. This schedule allowed a maximum of two students per day. Each participant took part in the experiment individually and only once. 3.7 Running the study Each morning before the study commenced, a checklist was used to confirm the route was set up correctly, e.g., corridor lights were on and display materials were in place. In addition, data were collected of the environmental conditions along the route, specifically light (amount of illumination) and sound (amount of decibels) to check whether conditions were consistent between participants, particularly since light and sound can adversely affect children with ASD. Conditions were noted consistent throughout the study. At the appointed time, the researcher collected each participant to take part in the study. Smalltalk was made on the way to the start point to put participants at ease, e.g., “How old are you?”, “When’s your birthday?”, etc. At the start point, the researcher commenced the script, kneeling down to smaller children to be on a child-friendly level. The control group was tested for their ability to find their way from the start point to the destination point without the application of wayfinding aids. Participants were given prompts about typical characteristics in the school corridor. The treatment group was tested for their ability to find their way from the start point to the destination point with the assistance of wayfinding aids. Participants were given prompts about wayfinding aids applied along the school corridor. At the start point, participants were reminded to take notice of where they were going as they would have to lead the way on their own next time (Cornell et al., 1989; Helvacioğlu and Olguntürk, 2011). The researcher then took the participant from the start point to the destination point, the Art Room, pointing out existing features in the school corridor control group) or wayfinding aids (treatment group). Once they had reached the destination, participants were taken back to the start point via the reverse route. On the return, they were reminded to look around them, reminded of cues they had previously passed and that they would be finding their way to the Art Room next time. Having arrived back at the start point, the participant was immediately instructed to find his/her way back to the Art Room. 3.8 Post-study interview Directly after the wayfinding task, a questionnaire was administered to each participant asking for his/her reactions. A spare classroom was allocated for the purpose near the start point, designated Miss (Author’s name) Interview Room to help participants feel at ease. 35 Evidence-based design Two chairs were positioned next to one another at a desk rather than facing each other as some children with ASD prefer to avoid eye contact. The researcher explained the questionnaire and provided a separate sheet of emojis (sad and smiley faces) for participants’ use. The researcher asked the questions and completed the questionnaire and the child was encouraged to point to the relevant emoji. The questionnaire took around 5 min to administer. Administering the questionnaire moments after completing the wayfinding task increased validity and gave participants the best opportunity of recalling how they felt about the activity. At the end of the process, participants were handed a personalized, laminated certificate, together with a university-branded notebook and pen to thank him/her for taking part in the study. Shortly after the study concluded, parents/guardians were sent a thank you letter enclosing a $20 gift card. Teachers and janitorial staff who had assisted with the study were also given a thank you card and a $5 gift card (the maximum amount permitted by the SD). 3.9 Data collection To increase reliability, data collected included: data mining by the SD, observations, questionnaires, behavioral mapping, video and audio recordings, timings and interviews. In conducting an EBD research study, various measures were used to test the influence of wayfinding aids including: • success of reaching the destination, measured by whether the participant reached/did not reach the destination; whether they reached it directly or indirectly; and the time taken to reach the destination; • degree of independence, measured by degree of presence of the researcher; number of verbal prompts administered; number of physical prompts administered; • use of wayfinding aids, measured by number of times colored doors, colored shapes on the floor, and signage were referred to by the participant while wayfinding or in the post-study interview; and • participants’ opinions about the wayfinding task, measured by the post-study interview. 4. Conclusions This paper outlines the steps taken to conduct an exploratory EBD research study designed to find out whether wayfinding aids applied along a school corridor would increase the ability of children with ASD to find their way along a set route with minimal or no verbal or physical assistance. The results of the experiment are not detailed here but will be the subject of a separate paper. Detailed here are the key lessons learned from the process of conducting the experiment. 4.1 Logistics One of the main challenges conducting the study was logistics. The time take to gain asynchronous approval from the SD, then the IRB, then back to the SD with additional amendments, required time-consuming negotiation and revision over many months. Manufacturing and installing wayfinding aids was also a laborious task for which additional assistance was required. Researchers should be aware that an experiment of this nature can be a lengthy process and plan accordingly. 4.2 Collaboration Conducting EBD research in a school environment with participants with ASD is not achieved by the researcher alone. It requires collaboration and the cooperation of many 36 ARCH 13,1 different parties, parents/guardians, the children themselves, SD personnel, teachers, janitorial staff, etc. The researcher also had to be prepared to compromise to the needs of the SD while maintaining the integrity of the study purpose. Also, in an experiment on site, unexpected issues can arise, e.g. a participant is off sick and has to be rescheduled. Some items can be mitigated, e.g. a check beforehand to see if a fire alarm test is scheduled. The researcher needs to be adaptable to site situations. 4.3 Number of participants An inherent problem conducting research with children with ASD is finding sufficient participants. Despite data indicating 1:59 children has a diagnosis of ASD (Baio et al., 2018), finding large numbers of suitable participants in one school is not easy. Added to this, children at the lower end of the spectrum may be unable to take part. Also, children can be sick or refuse to take part. Expanding the age range and keeping the selection criteria as open as possible were the most effective measures to increase participant numbers. Holding the research during the Summer Program, while increasing the number of potential participants in one place, had a drawback in that attendance was not mandatory so some potential participants were on holiday or otherwise unavailable. 4.4 Characteristics of children with ASD The variability in the characteristics of children with ASD in the study meant that behaviors were unpredictable, from some children who were distracted and had to be continually reminded to keep on task, to those who were silent throughout. Classroom observations were useful in framing these behaviors. Time as a measure of success lacked validity as three participants had ambulatory difficulties which were not recorded on their educational records and thus took longer to complete the study. It is unclear whether additional participants would have provided more synergy or yet more variability. 4.5 Limitations The decision was made to use typically developing children in the pre-test for reasons outlined. Post study, we support this view since the findings indicated that children with ASD varied so much in their wayfinding behavior all foreseen circumstances could not have been identified. Also, in a normal school situation, doors would generally be open at passing times which would obscure the door color. In this situation, an additional matching strip of colored material could be applied around the door frame so that the color would be visible when the doors were open. 4.6 Future research Future research could expand into a larger wayfinding study in a school used by children with ASD or into other environments that they visit, e.g., a hospital or store. The procedures used in this study could be applied to test other variables in schools, e.g., the effects of lighting or classroom layout. More research experiments testing environmental treatments could provide professionals with EBD findings on how to design schools suitable for children with ASD. 4.7 Summary One of the drivers for this study was the current lack of EBD research into the design of environments suitable for children with ASD. By documenting in detail, the steps taken to conduct the research, the study aimed to lay a foundation that other researchers could apply in similar experiments. It is hoped that this will encourage other researchers to adapt and conduct their own similar research elsewhere.     Staying in the hospital (e.g., hospitalization and rehabilitation), away from people’s own familiar living environments, is enough to make them emotionally vulnerable in addition to the health statuses they are confronted with. The health problems, such as life-threatening illnesses, which bring people into healthcare environments, can be tremendous stressors for them (Davydow et al., 2013). Even when patients are discharged from an intensive care unit and transferred to rehabilitation centers (e.g., transitional care units and long-term care units), their physical activities may often be limited during the recovery due to physical impairments (e.g., weakened muscles; Chaboyer et al., 2005). Besides appropriate clinical treatments to heal patients’ critical illnesses, a well-planned healthcare environment can expedite the speed of their recovery (Andrade & Devlin, 2015). Therefore, there is increasing interest among healthcare designers about the relationship between physical environments in healthcare environments and their impacts on people (Hamilton & Watkins, 2009; Sadatsafavi et al., 2015). Ambient environments, specifically with pleasant aromas, can yield diverse positive health out- comes such as reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (Lehrner et al., 2005); increased pain tolerance (Prescott & Wilkie, 2007); and improved quality of sleep (Lytle et al., 2014). However, contrary findings to these positive impacts of aromatherapy have periodically been found (Buckle, 2014), as studies have explored efficacies of aromatherapy on different people in different settings with inconsistent standards, in terms of dosages, durations, and processes (S´ anchez-Vidan ˜a et al., 2017). Furthermore, research about aromatherapy has been conducted relatively more frequently in hospital settings than in rehabilitation settings (e.g., transitional care unit and long-term care unit). Hence, with a gap in research about the effectiveness of aromatherapy during rehabilitation, there is a critical need to investigate the efficacy of aromatherapy in rehabilitation settings. . . . research about aromatherapy has been conducted relatively more frequently in hospital settings than in rehabilitation settings (e.g., transitional care unit and long-term care unit). Hence, with a gap in research about the effectiveness of aromatherapy during rehabilitation, there is a critical need to investigate the efficacy of aromatherapy in rehabilitation settings. Another critical gap in design research is a lack of established theory concerning interior design (Thomson, 1978; Ulrich et al., 2010). Although multidisciplinary perspectives can improve research and broaden the scope of the discipline, researchers should keep encouraged theory building specific to the discipline (Clemons & Eckman, 2011). However, the reality is that the majority of studies in the interior design field have not been developed from theoretical frameworks (Bae et al., 2019). In addition, a gap exists in research about healthcare environments, and the gap is the lack of methodologically rigorous studies leading to a low level of evidence (Huisman et al., 2012). Although conducting research about physical environments’ impact on people’s wellness has been increasing in design fields, there are still many more studies conducted in health-related fields (e.g., medical field) rather than in design fields (e.g., interior design field). These limited attempts in design fields to explore the relationships between environments and wellness are even frequently criticized for a lack of rigor (Huisman et al., 2012). Moreover, experimental studies are regarded as more rigorous studies than observational studies because observational studies are only able to demonstrate the social phenomena at specific times which cannot be interpreted as causal relationships, whereas results from experimental studies can generate cause and effect relationships (Sullivan, 2011). In conclusion, ambient scent environments should be tested by various populations based on their health status and diverse environments (e.g., hospitals, rehabilitation units, residences) with rigorous study designs. Therefore, to fill the current gap in the body of knowledge, this study is designed to examine how ambient scent environments’ rehabilitation settings (e.g., long-term care units) can improve the residents’ wellbeing via an experimental study. As the proposed interventions are tested by an experimental design rather than a descriptive study, the interventions will be examined for their effectiveness on the wellness from a design perspective, not just describing the current conditions. Literature Review Theory of Supportive Design The Theory of Supportive Design helps interpret the needs of patients, visitors, and staff in connection with the physical environments of healthcare facilities and provides guidelines or strategies for implementing supportive design for the users (Ulrich, 1991). The major premise of the Theory ofSupportiveDesignisthat“Topromotewellness, healthcare facilities should be designed to foster copingwithstress”(p.99),andhealthcareenvironments can minimize stress level and promote well- nessviathreeconditions:(1)asenseofcontrolwith respect to physical–social surroundings, (2) access tosocialsupport,and(3)accesstopositivedistractions in physical surroundings (Ulrich, 1991). Det- rimental effects of stress on wellness for patients and staff are well-documented and present a major obstacle to healing (Salonen et al., 2013). In general,patientsfeelstressedbecauseoftwomainrea- sons: (1) They experience illness associated with reduced physical capabilities, uncertainty, and painfulmedicalproceduresand(2)physical–social environments that are noisy, lack of privacy and social support, and cause all of which have a negative impact on patients’ wellness (Ulrich, 1991). The Theory of Supportive Design helps interpret the needs of patients, visitors, and staff in connection with the physical environments of healthcare facilities and provides guidelines or strategies for implementing supportive design for the users. Stress threatens patients’ psychological, physiological, and behavioral wellness (Ulrich, 1991). A sense of helplessness, feelings of anxiety and depression can be indicators of the psy- chological impact of stress, and increased blood pressure, muscle tension, and high levels of circulating stress hormones can be indicators of phy- siological impacts of stress (Frankenhaeuser, 1980). Verbal outbursts, social withdrawal, passivity, and noncompliance with medication regimes can also be regarded as behavioral impacts of stress (Ulrich, 1991). Among the third element from the Theory of Supportive Design, positive distraction refers to “the ability to allow the individual to shift focus from negative foci within the health environment to the more restorative aspects of the non-medical world” (Shepley, 2006, p. S34). Positive distraction covers both static stimuli (e.g., reading mate- rial, photographs, and representational posters or paintings of nature) and active stimuli (e.g., music, animals, and laughing; Andrade & Devlin, 2015). An environment having a moderate degree of positive stimulation (i.e., neither too high nor too low) is the most optimal environment for wellbeing because, as an environmental design attri- bute, positive distraction can help restoration from negative effects (Ulrich, 1991). To be specific, patients have a tendency to focus more on their worries, which causes increased stress, especially in environments providing a lower level of positive stimulations or distractions. The main roles of positive distraction are to lower patient stress and to promote wellness because it evokes positive feelings, makes patients focus on interesting things without being disturbed by stress, and finally prevents worrisome thoughts (Ulrich, 1991). Patients can be distracted by what they see and hear and move their attention from pain and stress to those distractions (Devlin et al., 2016). Depression/Mood Stress, anxiety, and depression are three common health concerns in modern society. Anxiety, as one of the symptoms of stress, in fact, is frequently interpreted as a synonym for stress (Buckle, 2014). Anxiety disorders lead to 10.4% of the disability-adjusted life years coming with neurological, mental, and substance use disorders and happen among approximately 1% of the world’s population (Whiteford et al., 2015). Likewise, according to a report about depression by the World Health Organization in 2016, almost 350 million people in the world have depression, making it the most concerning health issue in the 21st century (S´ anchez-Vidan ˜a et al., 2017). Patients in healthcare environments are especially vulnerable to these psychological illnesses (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression) because they often lose their sense of control and identity and feel helpless (Buckle, 2014). As a quick, simple, and inexpensive method dealing with stress, aromatherapy often has been investigated by researchers. The impact of aromatherapy while waiting at a dental clinic has been investigated by a few studies. Two hundred patients were exposed to either an ambient odor environment (lavender or orange), an ambient sound environment, or a controlled environment (Lehrner et al., 2005). The results suggested that patients reported lower anxiety and better mood while waiting in the ambient odor environments. In another cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), 340 patients waiting for a dental appointment were investigated in a setting either having or not having lavender scent (Kritsidima et al., 2010). The authors compared self-reported anxiety scales and found a significantly lower anxiety level among patients in a setting with lavender scent. In addition, a recent study found the impact of olfactory stimulant along with a garden view on reduced heart rates and improved behavioral symptoms among patients with dementia (Goto et al., 2017). However, there are several studies that have found conflicting results for aromatherapy on psychological status. For example, contrary to the findings by Lehrner et al. (2005; reduced anxiety levels and improved mood in the ambient odor environment rather than in the ambient sound environment at dental waiting areas), Holm and Fitzmaurice (2008) found contradictory results in waiting areas in a pediatric emergency department. The participants were exposed to one of four settings providing (1) no intervention, (2) classical music with 60–70 beats per minute, (3) aromatherapy, or (4) both music and aromatherapy. Although music had a positive impact on decreasing anxiety levels, aromatherapy did not. Another study in a similar setting, which was the waiting area for a plastic surgeon, found different results from similar previous studies (e.g., Fenko & Loock, 2014; Holm & Fitzmaurice, 2008). There were four different settings: (1) no intervention, (2) aroma scent, (3) instrumental music, and (4) both aroma scent and music. Reduced anxiety levels were found in both the music and aroma scent settings, but no impact on anxiety was found in the combination setting. A recent study by Igarashi (2013) also cast doubt on the effectiveness of inhalation aromatherapy on psychological and physiological wellness. The author found that even though there was an improvement of health status within the experimental group, which was exposed to the inhalation aromatherapy, there was no impact compared to the control group, which was not exposed to the aromatherapy. However, it could be that the small number of participants contributed to their not finding any differences between the groups. In addition, 330 patients were randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy inhalation setting or a placebo inhalation setting during their radiotherapy (Graham et al., 2003). There were no significant differences in self-reported depression and psychological health status, but there was in self-reported anxiety. In conclusion, as mentioned above, the effectiveness of aromatherapy is still debated, and the lack of standards for using aromatherapy, in terms of dosages, directions, and duration may lead to inconclusive results among researchers (S´ anchez-Vidan ˜a et al., 2017). Method A RCT design was applied to explore the associations between an ambient scent environment as a positive distraction, providing olfactory stimulation and residents’ wellness in long-term care facilities. For this study, the participants were randomly assigned to either a placebo group or an intervention group. In addition, only the participants were blinded, and they were not informed of group allocation, as the data were collected and analyzed by a sole investigator who is not blinded. Therefore, an RCT with a singleblinded design was applied to answer the research questions for this study. Residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities. Long-Term Care Facility A has two nursing home buildings (i.e., Building A and Building B) and Long-Term Care Facility B has one nursing home building (i.e., Building C). There were five inclusion criteria for this study. One of the inclusion criteria for the study was that residents must have stayed at the facility for at Table 1.

The second inclusion criterion was that residents must be cognitively able to properly understand and consent to the study. This inclusion criterion was determined by the staff. The third and fourth exclusion criteria were residents having any problems with their olfactory system (e.g., cannot smell scent) and resi- dents taking any medications for depression for the past 2 weeks. When recruited, residents were asked to smell a jar of 1 ounce of carrier oil with six drops of 100% essential lavender oils (Nature’s Truth, Ronkonkoma, NY) and to describe the scent. Once the residents provided an answer that suggested lavender (e.g., flower, something sweet), they were included in the study as potential participants. Lastly, if residents received a higher score than 10 (indicating severe depression) in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at baseline, they were excluded from the study due to ethical issues (see Figure 1). For this study, a total of 58 residents (18 residents from Building A, 20 residents from Build- ing B, and 20 residents from Building C) were recruited upon institutional review board approval. The anticipated number of participants for this study was at least 58 participants to get statistically powerful results based on an effect size of .74 (Karadag et al., 2017), power of 0.80, a of .05, and minimum detectable effect of 2.0 (Djimeu & Houndolo, 2016). Of 257 residents from two long-term care facilities, 168 res- idents were excluded because they did not meet more than one of the inclusion criteria. In addition, 29 residents declined to participate. Lastly, one more resident was excluded because the resident’s baseline score on GDS was above 10 of 15 points. Table 1 describes the 58 residents recruited for this study. Of 58 residents, 38 participated in the study from Long-Term Care Facility A, 18 at Building A, and 20 at Building B, respectively. The remaining 20 residents were recruited from Long-Term Care Facility B. All residents from Long-Term Care Facility A live in a private room. On the other hand, two residents from Long-Term Care Facility B live in a private room and eight residents live in a shared room without a roommate. The other 10 residents from LongTerm Care Facility B live in a shared room with a roommate. However, in this study, none of the participants in this study were roommates. In other words, the 10 residents who had a roommate in a shared room were the only participants in their room. Once the baseline data were collected, the 58 residents were randomly assigned into either a placebo or intervention group. Since participants were recruited from two different long-term care facilities and three different buildings, and the room size and distance between a ventilation system and a bed differs. Therefore, before randomi- zation, the participants were stratified into gender, three buildings, and the room size. Age was not used for stratification because both longterm care facilities have a similar average age Table 2. Group Differences About Demographic Information.

Independent t Tests to Compare Group Differences in GDS at Baseline and Follow-Up Stages. Intervention Placebo Stages SD M SD DM t different in comparing the two groups. These results showed that the 58 residents were evenly distributed to either the intervention or the placebo group through the stratified randomization. To create an ambient scent environment providing olfactory stimulation, a 2-ounce small jar with six reed sticks (see Figure 2) was placed at the bedside of each resident between 12 and 18 in. away from the side of the bed. According to the formula for dilution from the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy, 1-ounce carrier oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil (Nature’s Truth, Ronkonkoma, NY) were used to make a 1% dilution, based on guidelines to dilute essential oils (Worwood & Worwood, 2012). For the elderly, the recommended dilution for environmental inhalation is less than 2%. The aroma typically lasts about 2–4 weeks, depending on room size, ventilation, fans, humidity, heating, closed doors, open doors, air conditioning, and so on (Tisserand & Young, 2013). For the placebo group, instead of aromatic oil, only carrier oil which is a nonscented oil (i.e., grape-seed oil) was added to a 2-ounce glass jar with six reed sticks. For both groups, the jar was placed at the bedside of each resident between 12 and 18 in. away from the side of the bed. To use the jar with reed sticks and diffuse more effectively in indoor Figure 2. A 2-ounce glass jar with reed sticks, which used for this study. environments, the reed sticks could be simply flipped once a week if needed. Lastly, the participants were asked how they liked the scent of intervention at the end of the experiment. Data Analysis Once the data were collected, it was screened for a missing value. During the 2 weeks of intervention, 16 residents were lost for follow-up (8 res- idents in the intervention group and 8 residents in the placebo group). Missing data were recorded if anyone who dropped the study (e.g., residents did not want to put the jar next to their bedside anymore) did not follow the instructions (e.g., change the jar location away from their bedside), took medication, or missed the follow-up questionnaire. For this study, no imputation for those missing data was conducted; therefore, only the data completed both baseline and follow-up were analyzed. The quantitative data were analyzed by using SPSS Statistics Version 25 (Armonk, NY). Regression assumptions (i.e., normality, linearity, independency, and homogeneity of variance) were also examined prior to regression analyses. Due to high changes of multicollinearity for the interaction terms, regression analyses were reported with variance inflation factors (VIF). The mean centering method was used for all the interaction terms in regression analyses to alleviate VIF greater than 10, which threat collinearity (Mason & Perreault, 1991). Results Table 3 describes the independent t tests that were conducted to compare group differences in GDS scores at both baseline and follow-up stages.

To explore the moderation impact of intervention groups on the association between other vari- ables (i.e., distance to a ventilation system, square foot (SF), and building) and changes in GDS, additional regression analyses were conducted. Table 6 shows the estimates of the associations among major predictors (i.e., baseline GDS, intervention), each effect modifier (i.e., distance to a ventilation system, SF, and building), and changes in GDS (Models 1, 4, and 7) as well as the interaction terms of intervention and baseline GDS (Models 2, 5, and 8) and each effect modifier (Models 3, 6, and 9). Regarding the effect of a distance to a ventilation system from a bed, the three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were all statistically significant; however, Model 1, adjusted R2 ¼ .23, F(3, 38) ¼ 4.98, p < .01, had a slightly higher ability to explain the variance than Model 2, adjusted R2 ¼ .21, F(4, 37) ¼ 3.64, p < .05, and Model 3, adjusted R2 ¼ .22, F(5, 36) ¼ 3.25, p < .05. Again, only baseline GDS statistically predicted changes in GDS in three models, and the results indicated no measurable effect of the interaction between baseline GDS and ventilation on changes in depression. Similarly, three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of SF on changes in depression. Although the three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were all statistically significant, Model 4, adjusted R2 ¼ .23, F(3, 38) ¼ 4.96, p < .01, had a slightly higher ability to explain the variance than Model 5, adjusted R2 Table 4.

Table 4 describes the paired samples t tests that were conducted to compare GDS scores at baseline and follow-up for each group. The results showed that both the intervention and placebo groups had a statistically significant differ- ence in GDS at follow-up from baseline. To be specific, the intervention group had significantly lower GDS at follow-up (M ¼ 3.14, SD ¼ 2.06) than at baseline, M ¼ 4.19, SD ¼ 1.83, t(20) ¼ 2.18, p < .05. The placebo group also had a significantly lower GDS at follow-up (M ¼ 3.62, SD ¼ 2.01) than at baseline M ¼ 5.19, SD ¼ 2.06, t(20) ¼ 3.34, p < .05. Interestingly, the placebo group (DM ¼ 1.57) had a bigger difference in GDS between baseline and follow-up than the intervention group (DM ¼ 1.05). To explore a moderation effect of the intervention group on the association of depression scores, additional regression analyses were conducted. Table 5 shows the estimates of the associations between two predictors (i.e., baseline GDS and intervention) and follow-up GDS (Model 1) as well as an interaction term of baseline GDS and intervention (Model 2). While Model 1 was statistically significant and explained 13% of the var- iance, adjusted R2 ¼ .13, F(2, 39) ¼ 4.11, p < .05, Model 2 was not statistically significant, adjusted R2 ¼ .11, F(2, 39) ¼ 2.67, p ¼ n.s. In addition, in Model 2, only baseline GDS statistically predicted follow-up GDS (b ¼ .42, p < .05). This result indicated that the intervention had no measurable effect on depression. Note.

For the questions about how the participants perceived the scent for 2 weeks, in the intervention group, 16 (76.2%) of 21 participants liked the scent. Four participants (19.0%) did not notice any scent from the jar because it was not strong at all. Lastly, only one participant (5.8%) said that the scent was a little strong. In the placebo group, 7 (33.3%) of 21 participants mentioned that they liked the scent (19.0%), the scent was not bad (9.5%), and acceptable (4.8%). The rest of the participants (66.7%) said that they could not detect any scent. In conclusion, no statistically significant impact of effect modifiers on changes in GDS was found. Additional regression analyses were conducted by adding the control variables (i.e., gender and age) to each model. The results were consistent, indicating baseline GDS as the only statisti- cally significant predictor of changes in GDS. Discussion As one of inexpensive and noninvasive complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) meth- ods, aromatherapy has been frequently applied, and its positive impacts, especially the impact of lavender, on mood have been continuously explored (Ndao et al., 2012; S´ anchez-Vidan ˜a et al., 2017). To be specific, recent previous literature reported a positive impact of lavender on people’s mood, such as anxiety and depression (Karadag et al., 2017). However, the results of the present study showed a placebo effect of ambient scent environment on the residents’ depression. To be specific, both intervention and placebo groups had statistically significant decreases in the GDS scores at the follow-up from baseline. This placebo result might indicate that the presence of a positive distraction (i.e., the presence of a decorative jar) is more effective in improving mood than the scented environment per se, as the jar may allow the participants to shift their focus from negative foci to the more restorative aspects of the nonmedical world. The placebo could also be the result of the presence of a jar suggesting aromatherapy. In addition, further regression analyses showed no statistically significant interaction effect of the intervention and the baseline depression score. This placebo result might indicate that the presence of a positive distraction (i.e., the presence of a decorative jar) is more effective in improving mood than the scented environment per se, as the jar may allow the participants to shift their focus from negative foci to the more restorative aspects of the nonmedical world. The placebo could also be the result of the presence of a jar suggesting aromatherapy. A placebo effect of lavender aromatherapy has been reported in previous literature (Chamine & Oken, 2015). To be specific, a recent study found 167 a placebo effect of lavender essential oil on anxiety in spite of different populations in the study (Franco et al., 2016). The authors conducted a randomized study with a placebo control group to explore whether lavender essential oil was effective to reduce female patients’ anxiety levels before their breast surgery. The results found that the patients of both the intervention and placebo groups had statistically lower anxiety levels, indicating a placebo effect of lavender essential oil. The authors suggested a placebo effect was involved in terms of the decrease in anxiety among the control group who received nonscent aromatherapy. What is more, the effect of lavender aromatherapy on people’s mood is still debated among scholars. In systematic review papers, more results showing an improvement in mood have been found than results indicating negative impacts or insignificant differences (Lee et al., 2011). For example, one recent study found decreased depression levels among community-living older adults after 8-week aromatherapy (Xiong et al., 2018). However, the authors explored three different aroma scents, including lavender, and the study did not have a placebo group. Therefore, not all studies were able to test a placebo effect, even though the positive impact may be associated with a placebo effect. The present study further looked at the interaction effects of the intervention and other vari- ables (e.g., baseline scores, ventilation distance, SF, and building); however, it was not able to detect any significant measurable interaction effects between the intervention and the moderating variables. In other words, a different distance to the ventilation system did not have a statistically significant association with the intervention on the changes in depression. Also, different SF and buildings had the same results as above. Not enough variation within the moderating variables may lead to these results. To be specific, each room’s configuration (i.e., distance to ventilation and SF) is similar to each other, and the rooms in Building A, especially, had identical layouts. The low value of the standard devia- tions for both distance to ventilation (ft; intervention ¼ 1.35, placebo ¼ 1.31) and SF (ft2; intervention ¼ 22.77, placebo ¼ 16.36) may indicate these similar layouts across the three buildings (Table 2). Finally, these narrow ranges of variations may not provide enough information to detect the moderating roles on the impact of lavender scent environment. Even though no statistically meaningful relationship between the built environment and lavender essential oil’s impact on mood was found, this study is the first to explore the built environments’ moderating effect on aromatherapy. Hence, additional research investigating a potential relationship between the built environment and aromatherapy should be desired. Limitation Unfortunately, this study has significant limitations just as many other studies conducted on the impact of ambient scent environment. First of all, as a single-blind study, this present study design has a limitation regarding observer bias because only the participants did not know the allocation and the investigator knew the participant allocation. Since the data were collected through one- on-one conversation between a participant and the investigator, blinded participants’ responses might be affected by the interaction with the investigator. Hence, whether or not they remained blinded throughout the study is still questionable. Secondly, not having a control group, which did not receive any treatment at all, may be problematic regarding representativeness. Because they already agreed to participate in the study and signed the consent form, they may have a favorable opinion on the ambient scent environment. The placebo effect could be the result of participation in the study. Therefore, double-blind stud- ies can be conducted to minimize potential observer bias and to increase the representativeness of the participants. The third limitation is the small number of participants recruited for this study. The study met the statistical power at the baseline (N ¼ 58); however, only 42 participants were analyzed at the follow-up. Therefore, the statistical power of the results was threatened. In addition, the participants were recruited in three different buildings from two different long-term care facilities. Although the participants were randomly assigned to either group by using stratified randomization, many potential confounders exist due to the different environmental settings (e.g., service, building layout, staff). Moreover, the deviation for each environmental setting (e.g., distance to the ventilation and SF) was too small across the participants to investigate the moderating role of the built environment on the impact of ambient scent environment. Another limitation of this study is that any possible other environmental factors associated with the dependent variables (i.e., depression) are not considered. For example, the number of family visits may be associated with depression lev- els. However, the present study did not collect any other environmental factors. The intensity of dilution is the fifth limitation. For this study, 1% dilution was used with the lavender essential oil because less than 2% dilution is preferred for the elderly (Worwood & Worwood, 2012). However, 1% of dilution may not be strong enough to find out the impact of the lavender scent. In addition, this study did not ask whether caregivers perceived the scent to demonstrate a perceivable dilution. If stronger dilution was used for the study, different results might be found. Furthermore, the level of the volatile component of the essential oil was not considered, although it would affect the strength of scent and the duration of exposure to the intervention. As no standard regarding dilution is available in practice yet (S´ anchez-Vidan ˜a et al., 2017), future studies should additionally explore setting a standard regarding dilution and then investigate the impact of different dilution on wellness. In addition, further spatial attributes (e.g., open or closed door and average duration of stay in a room) should have been considered because those factors may affect the impact of aromatherapy on the participants. Whether doors are opened or closed would affect the distribution of ambient scent within the room or outside the room. In this way, it would eventually change the duration of diffuse scent for each participant and disturb implementing the identical intervention as some participants might not fully be exposed to the intervention. This study did not count the duration that the participant spent in their room during the day. The participants might spend more time in a common area than in their room, and it would also influence the duration of exposure to the intervention. Lastly, the improvement in depression may be a result from changes in time. It is possible that the participants were recovering from their illness and their mood improved as a result. Although all the participants stayed at least 1 month at the time of their participation, this study did not examine how long they have been in the facilities nor each participant’s health diagnosis such as chronic diseases or acute diseases. Therefore, the information about the participants’ health trajectory has not been considered. It would be interesting to measure GDS at three points (i.e., 2 weeks before the intervention, the beginning of the intervention, and the end of the intervention) to study the potential impact of time on GDS improvement. Concurrently, future studies should focus on the impact of ambient scent environment as overcoming the limitations mentioned above. Rigor of the previous studies concerning ambient scent environment has been often critiqued by researchers, and this methodological limitation has made researchers uncertain about the impact of an ambient scent environment and is cautious with the findings from the previous literature. Therefore, the impact of ambient scent environment on people’s wellness is still inconclusive among scholars. Forthcoming research conducted with a methodological rigor should build on the current literature review by addressing the limitations mentioned from this present study. Also, the majority of studies about an ambient scent environment have been conducted in medical fields rather than design fields. One of the considerable problems in the interior design field is a lack of theory within the field, which is leading to limited studies developed from theoretical frameworks (Bae et al., 2019). Future studies should be developed from a theoretical framework in the interior design field and should focus more on the impact of ambient scent environment from interior design perspectives. Those efforts can enhance the current literature in interior design discipline and contribute theory building within the field. Conclusion A number of the older population resides in long-term care facilities in the United States, and the number has slightly grown over the past decades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). The problem among the residents in long-term care facilities is that people who live in institutional settings are more likely to suffer from psychological disorders than people who live in noninstitutional settings (Seitz et al., 2010). One of the prevalent psychological disorders among long-term care facilities residents is depression, and many of them have shown depressive symptoms (Barca et al., 2010). Depression in a late-life stage is complicated to treat because diverse and complex factors (e.g., health condition, social sup- port, physical and mental status) lead to depression (Chen et al., 2014). To cope with the depressive symptoms, ambient scent environments (i.e., aromatherapy) are getting popu- lar among people who are worried about any side effects of traditional medicines (S´ anchezVidan ˜a et al., 2017). Aromatherapy, especially, has been frequently used to enhance people’s wellness as an inexpensive and noninvasive CAM (Ndao et al., 2012). A single-blind and randomized placebocontrolled study was conducted to explore the impact of an ambient lavender scent environment in the long-term care facility environ- ment. The results indicated a placebo effect of an ambient scent environment on depression as both intervention and placebo groups had improved depression levels at follow-up from the baseline. In addition, when moderating impacts of the built environment (e.g., distance to the ventilation system, SF, and different buildings) were analyzed, no statistically significant impact was found. Future studies can delve more into the topic by having a larger number of participants in a single facility. In addition, more studies on the relationship between an interior environment and the impact of ambient scent environment are warranted. Implications for Practice \u0004 Positive distraction in built environments can improve residents’ mood in long-term care facilities. \u0004 Even though the ambient scent environment in this study was not enough to find out significant improvement in residents’ mood, there was a placebo effect of having a positive distraction in their room. That might indicate the presence of a positive distraction (i.e., oil jar) is more effective in improving mood than the scented environment. \u0004 Although this study found that the built environment might not have a significant relationship with the impact of ambient scent environment on the improvement in mood, something for positive distractions in the built environment was helpful for residents’ mood. \u0004 Therefore, bringing something new to residents into their environment may create more emotionally supportive environments.    \n"

      "The number of People with Dementia (PwD) is rising worldwide. World Health Organization estimates that around 55 million people have dementia and this is rising to 139 million in 2050 (1). Dementia is an umbrella term that has within it various diseases, of which the most frequent (about 60-70 percent of all forms) is Alzheimer’s (2). This disease is characterized mainly by a general deterioration in cognitive function. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, computation,   learning ability, language, mobility, and judgment. Due to age and comorbidity that often characterize PwD, they are the most frequent visitors to healthcare facilities. Although PwD is a heavy consumer of health services, direct costs in developed countries arise mostly from community and residential care (3). In Europe, nowadays nursing homes and assisted home care are among the main lines of investment in the real estate sector. These facilities must be suitable for a fragile category of users like PwD. It is extremely important to design and build adequate structures, properly designed and implemented       as places where patients find themselves having to live as their disease slowly progresses(4,5). In Italy, most of the facilities are old and inadequate, with 7,372 structures, divided into residential care facilities for the elderly (3,365), psychiatric residential care facilities (2,035), and other residential care facilities for the physically, mentally, and terminally disabled. Most of the structures are located in the northern regions (2,651) (6). The beds currently available in Long-term Care (LTC) per 1,000 elderly residents are now 18.6 in Italy compared to 71.2 in Belgium, 54.4 in Germany,    and 51.0 in France (Figure 1). The OECD average is 43.8 (7). Is expected a rise in the need for new structures during the next years, due to trends in demographic development, an aging population, and changes in social and family patterns. There is a need for a major structural intervention aimed at developing, modernizing, and renovating the current outdated and inadequate facilities to cope with the growing care and healthcare demands of the coming decades (8). Additionally, there is the request to create a structure that is based on the need of residents,        Figure 1. The comparison of the bed numbers of LTC between 2010 and 2020 (Eurostat).       that can provide a better environment to facilitate and improve the health and well-being of patients (9). In this sense Evidence-Based Design can play an active role, providing spaces that are capable to promote healthy living (10–14). Nowadays it is clear that a built environment can be crucial in the health and well-being of the elderly as well as PwD. (4,5,15,16). As a physical health issue related to elderly people, falling is among the most frequent problems and it can result in other health concerns. In the past years, falling has been discussed by many researchers, pointing out the significant link between the falling rate and the risks of the physical environment (17,18). Other physical health factors, like infection (19,20), have also been proven to be strongly related. In recent years, more evidence is found between older adults’ mental health and the built environment, such as depression (21–24), psychometric properties (25–27), sense of home (28–30), cognitively stimulating (31), satisfaction (32) and so on. Furthermore, the social health component is highlighted, with an emphasis on the question of the connection between spatial arrangement and the social interaction of people experiencing dementia(33). There is an urgency to create facilities that are capable of answering the needs of both patients and staff (34).  1.1        Research gap  In the Italian context, the main instrument used is certification standards and Italian regulation. Unfortunately, these materials are quite outdated (1989) and do not take into consideration the advancement that has been done in research. There is also an urgency to collect the needs of both patients and stakeholders, to find expectations and requirements that facilities must have. The current model of residential care management in Italy often appears inadequate to current scenarios. The current model is still based on structured standards and commensurate with a rigid picture of the elderly population, linked to a parameter of “Nonself-sufficiency” that is too generic. Meanwhile, the current situation described by the most recent statistics and literature shows a more blurred and labile picture, which is constantly changing and capable of    fragmenting the framework that held together the generic needs ascribable to the guest into a series of specific needs and requirements very often linked to precise neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the study aims to bring out which aspects of the spaces intended to accommodate elderly People with Dementia pathologies should be most present and potentially interested in becoming cornerstones of a new model of Long-Term Care facilities (LTC).  2.        Materials and methods  This research uses a case studies analysis followed by a web-based survey as a methodological tool. The methodology used for the development of the survey was based on multiple choices questions with different solutions or conditions related to LTC for the various fields of analysis explored in depth in a case studies analysis. Through this dual identification of data, we were able to obtain a direct comparison for each aspect that emerged in the first part of the research. The goal of the survey is to better understand what elements residential facilities for the elderly should contain to satisfy the requirements of users. A web-based survey was conducted to find out the opinions and perceptions of users and stakeholders of healthcare facilities for PwD in Italy. The survey consists of:  1.        identification of the questions based on the indicators derived from the analysis of the comparison between Italian and foreign case studies; (assessment framework development) 2.        choice of the most useful way of administering the questionnaire, identified in the online transmission of a form, the most immediate way to disclose and receive feedback quickly; (web-based survey definition) 3.        processing of the data collected through graphs and tables obtained directly from the Google Form platform and then profiled to have an analysis of the responses; (data analysis)  The target audience for the questionnaire is diverse and broadly includes users and insiders of healthcare       facilities. Both managers and social and health care staff, as well as technical designers, were included, in addition to users/guests. This choice was made to also compare the different perspectives of those who have direct and close contact with the residential service environment.  2.1        Assessment framework development from the case study analysis  The survey follows broader research carried out through an examination of project experiences related to case studies and best practices in the European field over the last decade. This activity focused on the first part of the research, which aimed to compare the aspects that emerged from the design analysis and the impressions gathered from the human capital (users, managers, social and healthcare staff, etc.) related to residential spaces that provide hospitality and care for the elderly with dementia. The case studies were studied for the aspects related to the characteristics of their location - thus the starting environmental conditions were chosen to locate the settlement - of their sizing - thus for the density ratio between No. of guests and the development of units per floor - of their configuration - thus for their distributional typology - and of their functional organization - thus for the greater or lesser presence of some residential and socialization areas compared to others more related to service areas. The aspects that emerged from this analysis were summarized in graphs that identified trend lines common to the eight case studies chosen (Figure 2).  2.2        Web-based survey definition  The survey was divided into 4 parts:  1.        The first one is an introductory section, where the general aim of the project is declared and instructions for the participants are provided. It is clarified that the survey is anonymous and that the results are used for research purposes only. 2.        The second section is made with a statistical aim. This section includes basic demographic information such as gender and age for statistical purposes and questions that were not mandatory.    3.        The third section is the core of the survey. It’s composed of seven multiple-choice questions. Each question is structured with a question and a picture with three different variables to be chosen to answer the question. Each statement requires taking a clear position on some specific feature that the built environment must possess to have a positive impact on the well-being of PwD. The questions represent key aspects that are related with evidence in the relationship between well-being and PwD, previously emerged in the Assessment Framework Development: -        location, -        shared spaces, -        paths, -        living areas, -        external spaces, -        technologies, -        bedrooms. 4.        In the last part there is an open answer to collect other opinions and personal experiences.  2.3. Data collection and analysis  The typology of web-based surveys used frequently and effectively since the COVID pandemic to intercept the opinion of various stakeholders without having to conduct face-to-face interviews (35), was chosen to obtain as many responses as possible. The survey was submitted online via the Google Form platform and shared via email and social pages (Linkedin, Facebook, ...). It was chosen due to the need to collect as much as possible feedback (it has been submitted to around 500 stakeholders) and rapidly an answer. The data analysis has been done using an excel file, downloaded from the google website, and then analyzed with graphics and tables to examine the answers.  3.        Results  The survey has been submitted to an estimated number of people (around 500) and it collected 210 answers.       Figure 2. Analysis table for case studies.       The results were profiled from the significant sample collected at the end of the questionnaire administration and dissemination period. The data, considering a margin of error of 5 percent of confidence level above 90 percent appears to be statistically valid. The aspects that stand out the most when scrolling through the results were the following: a substantial alignment on the choice of location that prefers a populated context not very distant from hospital facilities (assumed to be no more than 15min/20min by car) in place of more isolated conditions. This finding is reinforced by the second preference (36.7%) of the question that hypothesizes internal LTC solutions or at least inserted in close connection with hospital-type facilities; another element of alignment is the respondents’ preference, regarding the type of distribution, circular - in itself a direct reference to the courtyard facility - a solution also often found in the Italian and foreign case studies examined. This evidence leads back to an important consideration that the raison d’être of these facilities is rooted not only in the motivations of the planner but also in those of the operators who live and work within them, as well as the managers in charge of optimizing service performance. Thus, it seems to be a choice that is solidly shared both by the design engineers who see, albeit in the variety of configurations proposed, the courtyard system as an ideal solution for organizing residential spaces. Another shared aspect is the tendency to prefer a condition that leads to having as many cores as possible on the ground floor (75 %), which pairs with the other consideration that emerged in another question asking respondents what aspects of a residence for the elderly they consider most relevant. The preference centered on the extensive development of the residential complex (45.2%) over having terraces and balconies for the cores on the various floors (33.7%) or having more than one Core per floor with shared socialization spaces (21.2%). Some choices, such as the presence of hospital garrisons near or even attached to the LTC area, hint at a reflection of the pandemic experienced in recent years.    3.1.        Section 1 – Statistical data  The map of the sample concerned turns out to consist mostly of planners (38.5%) and secondarily of social and health care personnel. On the other hand, it turns out that the share (less than 1%) related to elderly guests, the initial main reference, is not at all relevant and considerable (Figure 3). 60 percent of the sample is between the ages of 31-50, with a prevalence of women (53.4%) over men (Figure 4). This figure brings out the limitation of the choice made to disseminate the questionnaire exclusively via web channels. Conditioned certainly by the limitations due to security measures during the pandemic, this choice did not allow us to approach all stakeholders and thus obtain complete meaningful feedback. On the other hand, the comparison between the significant presence of responses provided by Managers (about 14%) and those provided by SocioHealthcare personnel (22.5%) is important (Figure 5).  Figure 3. The age of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.   Figure 4. The gender distribution of the people who were involved in the questionnaire        Figure 5. The position of the people who were involved in the questionnaire.     Figure 6. The questionnaire results about the location of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.      3.2.        Location  The main responses show a tendency to favor inhabited settings and the possibility of having hospital presidia not very far away if not even thinking the facility is already integrated within hospital areas. A very small portion believes that the following is to be preferred a location of the facility in an isolated urban setting away from hospital facilities (Figure 6).   3.3.        General aspects  As shown in Figure 7, the sample surveyed on this question is divided by a slight preference-about 10 percent deviation-for an extensive single-storey solution over the choice that proposed having terraces and balconies but with multi-level development. However, the number of preferences (from both managers and planners) for the solution with shared socialization spaces is also significant.        Figure 7. The questionnaire results about the general idea about the structure of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     Figure 8. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     3.4.        Distribution  56 planners indicate a circular distribution as the preferred solution, and this view is found even among the Managers and OSS staff (Figure 8). It is probably less functional or otherwise convincing to have a distribution where there is only one side of the rooms in sequence along the distribution corridor, compared to the solution instead of a Triple body that appears from the responses to be preferred.   3.5.        Living area  The most convincing solution for Managers (18), OSS staff (27), Designers (54), and the remaining components surveyed is certainly one that leads to a preference for living spaces shared among several units (Figure 9). Solutions involving the nucleus broken in half by a living area do not appear convincing or preferable, as reflected in the data offered by the questionnaire,        Figure 9. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.    Figure 10. The questionnaire results about the distribution of healthcare facilities for the elderly.     where both Managers and Designers do not consider this condition useful.  3.6.        Outdoor space  The evidence indicated in Figure 10 is a desire to have a strongly extensive condition instead of a multilevel development for residential facilities dedicated to the elderly. This need seems more vivid than other needs,   such as having terraces for each core or having larger and brighter core living spaces, clearly indicating a better quality of space concerning the well-being parameters.  3.7.        Future trends  Green continues to be a need felt by both Managers and operators as well as designers, coming out as a        Figure 11. The opinion about the future of healthcare facilities.    Figure 12. The questionnaire results about the personalization of the healthcare facilities for the elderly.    prominent element in the choice made by interviewees (Figure 11). This component of the LTC space appears to be favored over other seemingly more innovative aspects such as the prosthetic approach of spaces and services to the elderly, or the possibility of constant medical monitoring through the presence of an integrated center at the LTC.   3.8.        Personalization  The possibility for the guest to freely furnish his or her accommodation seems to be a choice that is more than agreeable to both operators and managers as well as planners. In contrast, only two responses expressed clear dissent to this possibility, suggesting that it is not a       viable solution in the context of LTCs (Figure 12). Another segment of respondents expressed a compromise solution but emphasized the importance of considering how guests can personalize their living spaces.  3.9.        Other considerations  The following are some important comments or suggestions provided by the respondents along with their answers and expressed preferences that can better guide the value of the analysis of the feedback provided by the questionnaire. These can be divided into three main themes:  A)        Issues related to the content: -        I believe we need to reshape the concept of care, focusing more on the new elderly, more technologically, and more active than in the past. Environmental designs are also welcome, but there is a need to focus on the staff; -        In general, it is desirable that the principles of environmental and architectural psychology become an increasingly integral part of the design process; -        Single room and private bathroom, free access to their closets, ability to move freely in outdoor spaces in safety, spaces dedicated to the rest of the operators, and the presence of the family both in the room and outside; -        I believe that personalizing one’s daily living spaces makes the place closer to the memory of the user, thus making the place “home”; -        A facility that facilitates and arranges for the use of aids such as lifts in the rooms and allows the caregiver to move easily with wheelchairs and stretcher showers. The severity of conditions of residents in LTC is increasingly common. Costs of tuition and staff minutes must be taken into consideration; -        Fundamental are aggregation and sharing of spaces and activities very important    to understand the background of the elderly person I explain myself who has been a mechanic does not have the same needs as someone who has been a clerk or housewife; - I would suggest the inclusion of an area for local community services, where to generate contact and exchange of knowledge and training between the residents of the LTC and the local community; B)        Issues related to the form and process of the survey: -        Enhance the possibilities of relating to the outdoors by grading the usability of public space according to the different needs of the residents and their families the answers can vary greatly about the context and size of the LTC. This reference is completely missing in the questions; -        Suggest that the questionnaire also be filled out by current and upcoming/future users (range >60 years old) of LTC to compare the response of technicians and that of ideal/current usersIntegration with city/ country communities; C)        Issues related to staff training and education: -        All staff, I mean all professionals in the multidisciplinary team, nurses, doctors, nurses, educators, and psychologists, should know, regardless of their specific skills, the users with whom they work, through mandatory courses on dementia, and the effects that incorrect relational approaches of care can have on the patient (e.g.: a joke in sympathetic intent by a nurse to an Alzheimer’s patient could be traumatic and devastating for the patient himself ); -        Trained staff to make the best use of the facility and outdoor spaces. Humanization and listening to the needs of the assisted to grasp their needs that become a guide for optimizing places and spaces; -        It is critical, even more than all the points above, that staff is properly trained and       chosen: you need motivated people who put the passion with which they carry out care first. Personnel of every level, from management to auxiliary: get back to being human.  3.10.        Comparison of the results  The analytical data derived from an in-depth study of the projects related to the case studies, and thus of realizations selected in a previous activity of the research, determined the main comparative comparison with the data that emerged from the questionnaire, having both studies as a basis common indicators (Figure 13). It is precisely in the choice of identifying indicators functional as much to the analytical understanding of architectural space as to the ability of the same to bring to light the value of the perception of the operators, deriving from them the questions to be submitted, that the lowest common denominator lies, which allowed a direct comparison of the data and cross-referencing of convergent responses. Several choices, as previously reported, have remarked an alignment between those who design LTC spaces and those who inhabit the same spaces (at least between operators and managers), a sign of a substantial convergence that thus allows us to mark pivotal points on which to elaborate models for the future of these facilities. Think for example of the circular distribution typology or at any rate with a courtyard,    favored by both designers and operators. Other aspects although not completely overlapping however find a good match both in the selected projects and in some significant percentages present in the various questions. For example, the choice of having shared socialization spaces between cores or the choice of having outdoor spaces adjacent to the residential units on the various floors. The topic of education has been also stressed by the respondents confirming the need for synergies in educational programs between health and built environment disciplines (36).  4.        Discussion and conclusion  The strongest evidence appears to be related to the strong consideration and weight given to the need for ever-present and larger green spaces and care (60.1 %), as opposed to the urgency for more technology (19.7 %) that might have hinted at the prosthetic approach, or more monitoring with the medical center within the facility (20.2 %). This aspect that emerges from the questionnaire is consistent with the choice of preferably having the cores on the ground floor, which was not always maintained, as observed in the case studies examined. Moreover, the tendency in the LTCs studied seems to be toward intensive rather than extensive solutions, with perhaps the possibility of also accommodating outdoor spaces on the upper levels in close contact with          Figure 13. The comparison between the results from the Case studies and Questionnaire.       the upper cores. The last relevant consideration in dementia cases is the response regarding the incidence of room customization versus less permissive situations. 61.5 % believe that there will be significant benefits if full customization of the room by the guest can be allowed. The research has returned a snapshot of the LTC not only national, providing an identikit that is enriched by values also detected in similar facilities abroad, offering scientific evidence through the analytical comparison of the case studies examined and the comparison with what has been expressed by the actors of residential care aimed at the elderly population. This framework offers some insights to identify, in the constants, possible fixed points from which we can start to structure a new model that aims to configure the Next Generation LTC. Moreover, many other insights should be deepened through research that moves from the indirect study to the direct study of the LTC environments, contemplating this time also the return of impressions and suggestions that can be transmitted by the real protagonists of this space, namely its guests. While this aspect was a strong limitation, it allowed us to probe the more analytical aspect of the design of an LTC by placing the magnifying glass more on which spaces and how many spaces should be contemplated in the Next Generation LTC model, leaving out for the moment other factors that require more in-depth study related to the perceptual sphere from which the state of well-being within the architecture derives.  5.        Research limitations and future developments  The survey was useful to collect opinions from different stakeholders in a fast and easy way, as it could be rapidly shared via email or the web. The research certainly has some limitations. Firstly, the web-based survey may not represent the entire panel of stakeholders, lacking an essential piece of data that should be acquired by a mode of administration, such as interviewing the guest directly. Elderly residents in these structures have not been able to fulfill the survey due to their condition and technological requirements. Not having this kind of feedback hinders this comparison with the other significant group of staff who manage    and operate LTC facilities. Therefore, the results show interest in the comparison between the responses given by those who design and those who then work in or manage residential facilities for the elderly. One of the main goals for future development will be to increase the sample size of answers and include as many people and stakeholders as possible. For example, using a paper-based survey to reach the elderly and residents. However, it is considered relevant to bring out the ever-increasing use of knowing user opinion, and the use of web-based surveys could become an easy and inexpensive way to verify it.
