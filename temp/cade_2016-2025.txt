Background Alma-Ata Declaration remains pivotal document global health history setting standard public commitment make community-led quality healthcare accessible physically financially
forerunner Global Strategy Health Year pursued partners rest twentieth century Sustainable Development Goal SDG Ensuring lives healthy promote well-being ages
ARCH Health-related SDGs achieved sustainably greater emphasis primary_health_care
Therefore renewing primary_health_care placing center efforts improve health_well-being essential respond complex rapidly changing world World_Health_Organization United Nations Children Fund UNICEF
Consequently necessary rethink design construction new primary_health_care_facilities adaptation existing ones particularly decisionmaking process initial stages
Decisions regarding physical characteristics layout design shape made early difficult change reverse later without significant financial commitments Zhao al
walls expensive erect floor plans healthcare_facilities usually change much short term
However healthcare systems evolve clinical environments changing needs spaces within building frequently change every two three years
Nevertheless even changes expected contingency planning health projects rarely informed empirical evidence works
Consequences limited testing include propagation low architectural value projects costly potentially harmful patients Ariadne Labs
researchers found project draws previously acquired knowledge insights beliefs derived decision-making experience
design related healthcare_environments adopted adapted without knowing users satisfied
Despite lack knowledge healthcare center meet people needs achieve balance outcome
Therefore relationship satisfaction facility user coherent design architectural_space brings patients positive experience greater liveability healthcare_facility Asfour
Spatial boundaries also influence user use_space physical attractive environment Harun_al
existing literature relating user experience healthcare environment small_number participatory studies focus spatial design aspects
studies concern quality service user_satisfaction physical_environment systems rather focusing user perspectives associated design factors built_environment healthcare
However perceptions expectations patients clients strongly linked use_space design_healthcare buildings
Nevertheless design factors healthcare_facilities better integrated design phase remained largely neglected Zhao_Mourshed
Therefore also necessary consider architectural environment focus attention spatial design relate users space
Previous studies shown good space design reflects health emotion reduction stress frustration visitor functional_efficiency visitor accessibility safety patient empowerment cognitive abilities spatial understanding Harun_al
One factors influence end users designing space layout considered one main activities architectural project new construction building adaptation
layout design involves locating activity spaces objects container space maximize minimize design goals meeting required spatial_relationships component spaces objects Ezzeldin al
Designing primary_health_care buildings spaces requires special attention due close complicated relationships space function Zhao al
However little research done space layout primary_health buildings

residential villas later adapted health function
found primary_health_care centers Salvador Lauro_de_Freitas existing structures born living_spaces unsuitable health_facility
private_space house unsuitable health function often residential_spaces respect minimum size provided Ministerial Decree
example USF_Vila_Praiana limited waiting spaces small corridors adequately allow users circulate
Converting residential_spaces healthcare functions involves inadequate distribution activities difficult distribution flows doctors patients
addition USFs derived existing buildings also primary_health care_units considered model health_facilities USF_Alto_de_Coutos II Salvador
Visiting health_center possible perceive building built health_center respecting clear functional organization spaces following regulations legislation
Expandability spaces
buildings even built health_centers planned enlarged future
However on-site surveys noted possibility buildings expanded occupying nearby parking lot garden
However would entail high costs structure designed modular way designed expand future
example USF_Alto_da_Terezinha evident inner space reduced structure needs enlarged accommodate new medical_offices
Therefore clear structure despite newly built flexible
Facility size
observational research on-site analysis carried activities comply minimum dimensions provided Ministerial Decree noted
houses adapted health_centers dimensions quite adequate perform health function
overall area building considered upstream measure affects many functional areas quality circulation staff support spaces capacity
positive thing allowed us begin internal flexibility spaces meeting room educational refreshment function USF_Alto_da_Terezinha clinics shared different doctors rotation carry various activities
However small size rooms also limits potential usability space flexibility

Factors identified users_perspective related functional_efficiency criteria ARCH Urban accessibility
One problems identified site_visits especially marginal districts concerns accessibility facilities
Roads underdeveloped districts Suburbio Ferrovi ario Salvador Areia Branca Lauro_de_Freitas roads accessible USF_Parque_Sao_Paulo paved roads
Furthermore simple find health_center location indicated precisely map
USF_Alto_de_Coutos difficult access case rain becoming torrential road
two structures located districts along Atlantic Ocean therefore developed area good accessibility
Parking area
Among public_spaces parking undesirable lacking enough parking lots disadvantaged health districts
Therefore besides accessible structures difficult access due_lack parking spaces parking lots closed open healthcare staff
Landscaping area external spaces
external areas present analyzed structures present poorly maintained
example USF_Parque_Sao_Paulo garden used parking lot rather social space users
garden USF_Vila_Praiana dangerous residential villa adapted health function abandoned swimming pool without protection risk falling
focus outdoor public_spaces therefore considered
Path circulation waiting_areas inner spaces
waiting_areas always adequate size facility capacity USF_Alto_de_Coutos waiting_area disproportionate number activities
Furthermore waiting_areas always located inside structure located outside USF_Parque_Sao_Paulo USF_Vila_Praiana due_lack space

Space accessibility analysis Improving_physical_space_health facilities areas near medical_offices rooms
However corridors still used sometimes adequate dimensions limited spaces perform distribution function existing structures USF_Alto_de_Coutos USF_Parque_Sao_Paulo USF Praiana corridors insufficient space walked especially patient walks difficulty
USF_Alto_da_Terezinha example analyze path circulation within facility
plan redesigned activities distributed based information gathered inspection
service spaces corridors main paths drawn divided patientsvisitors medical staff doctors_nurses public employees
However emerges analysis mixed path users without differentiation two categories
first suggestion would dedicate entire upper floor logistic administrative activities restricted access areas used doctors_nurses officials bring care activities lower floor ensure greater accessibility patients
Space accessibility means easy users reach health_facility interior space get services need
Accessing view internal external landscape one key factors users perception
Another important_factor related user emotional comfort absence openings capable viewing outside building surrounding landscape especially waiting_areas patient spends time allowed access medical_offices Table

USF_Alto_da_Terezinha Salvador path network medical staff_patients Table
Factors identified users_perspective related space accessibility criteria ARCH windows waiting room would increase user social comfort integrating environment natural_light
Furthermore data literature_review indicates exposure light key factor health_well-being users healthcare_environments
However considering excessive daylight Brazilian context also cause visual discomfort
large window could let daylight consuming energy heating cooling time
Therefore artificial light adequately balanced natural_light achieve good thermal social comfort Ebrahimi al Harun_al Zhao_Mourshed

design_considerations aid architects facility planners making design decisions new renovated pediatric_healthcare facilities improve facility efficacy performance aesthetics difficult alter architecture hospitals built therefore necessary consider various treatmentrelated aspects beforehand benefits patients health_care providers
Traditionally medicine pursued evidence-based treatments establish procedure defining measuring changes outcomes depending presence absence treatment judging efficacy
Moreover architecture introduced concept evidence-based designs
Since change physical_environment might affect progress diseases various ways rationale studying associations clear
belief physical_environment hospital could affect recovery patients existed since ancient times however difficult support assumption randomized controlled trialsalthough often conducted medicineare rarely adopted architecture
Medical facilities whose aims prevention diagnosis diseases well rehabilitation consist various medical place patients tend stay longest period therefore ward environments directly indirectly affect treatment outcomes

Discussion focus productivity cost-containment health_care systems currently sustaining challenge hospital management
LOS hospital represents one essential aspects measure quality patient_care one widely used variables evaluate resource allocation hospitals
Length_stay also critical measure determine required number beds hospitals planning key indicator comparing procedures hospitals across countries Allocating beds resources efficiently shortening patients LOS chief way achieve maximum productivity hospitals Reducing LOS restores hospital capacity increases productivity profits decreases waiting lists heightens patient_satisfaction
Furthermore beneficial effects LOS public National Insurance System reviewed intensively
Several methods early discharge planning recommended reducing LOS Medical personnel involved patients hospital care certain pressures worldwide minimize LOS LOS robust variable evaluate performance hospitals selected key variable
studies investigated light efficacy part ward environment
Lewy al found exposed light faster effect taking antidepressants reported took least - weeks antidepressant show effect seasonal depressive disorders whereas light could decrease depressive symptoms within weeks
Morning light also effective afternoon night light
Walch al examined spinal surgery patients randomly_assigned two conditions ward light versus ward light blocked
exposed light patients tended report less distress pains dark ward also needed fewer painkillers led savings total treatment costs
Furthermore light especially effective targeting patients psychiatric disorders l l d results suggest vital consider light ward arrangements however studies scrutinizing differences LOS depending light conditions
Beauchemin Hays reported LOS patients depression bright ward brief mean days Beauchemin Hays found LOS patients myocardial infarction especially women short-lived mean days

Discussion Participants descriptions healing_space healing_experience enhancers congruent Ulrich theories supported environments
theory supportive_design identifies stress reduction primary pathway healing postulates physical design supports social relationships provides positive_distractions enhances sense_control
Similarly participants study identified healing_spaces social_support ie cared comfort familiarity home
Research strongly supports role visitors family visits stress reducer
sense_control critical factor Ulrich theory participants specifically identify contributor healing_experience study
fact found corollary true many detractors healing described participants lack control physical_environment eg insufficient space uncomfortable furniture lack_privacy moderate noise
Congruent study Friedman al participants study highlighted TV positive_distraction using help sleep calming background noise keep touch outside world
Friedman al found patients allowed watch least hour TV prior surgery less anxious patients randomly_assigned routine care
studies demonstrated positive_distractions TV art nature reduce stress anxiety patients contrasted static views lack space
findings_study provide evidence environment supports perceived care well-being_patients beyond actual care receiving
findings build foundation well provide opportunity study environmental contributors healing using supported design theory
TV clearly portal patient afforded connect something outside current situation
interviews patients revealed TV primary element used take mind current situation well provide relaxation
variation outcomes patient depended channel selection easy TV openly surf available stations
TVs channel based patients able quickly find favorite show watched home find soothing channel provided calm environment drown hospital noise
stations within menu options higher frustration engaging TV patients tended watch known shows found calming stations sooth
findings_study show TV primary portal patient find positive_distraction connecting outside world well calm
Conclusion physical_environment provided cognitive physical spiritual support visual associations home comforting distractions comfortable furnishings space supported patients social relationships family hospital_staff
Patients offered real-life descriptions understanding concepts healing healing_spaces
pragmatic descriptions healing_space perceptions inpatient space differed researcher theoretical idealistic descriptions
theoretic definition healing_space physical_environment enhances cohesion mind body spirit promotes social cohesion healing relationships may need give way pragmatic definition
Patients identified healing_space feelings space evoked specifically sense cared sense_home feelings comfort calm

Interestingly although objective data point strongly toward positive_impact rebuilt environment sleep_quality difference subjective sleep_quality two groups
finding line wide body evidence pointing toward discrepancies objective measurements sleep_quality inpatient psychiatric settings eg mood disorders addictions eating disorders patients subjective report see Pyrke McKinnon Langstaff Gillard Bieling
Factors may contribute discrepancy include cognitive limitations may impact responding complex scales rely upon recall past events relative sensitivity objective subjective measures sleep_quality
PSQI requires participants consider past month sleep may cognitively difficult population also could confounded reports sleep home participant hospital one full month
Furthermore sleep medication subscale PSQI may inflated due timing psychiatric medication dosing sleep aid metabolic
Indeed previous reports indicate subjective report may exaggerate severity schedulerelated measures sleep_quality eg sleep duration latency resulting lack correlation complex sleep_quality variables eg sleep efficiency wake sleep onset Baune al Brooks Krumlauf Whiting Clark Wallen Kung Chou Lin Hsu Chung Lemke al Matuskey Pittman Forselius Malison Morgan Staner al Wallen al Woodward Bliwise Friedman Gusman Yamahara Noguchi Okawa Yamada
probable whereas objective measurement techniques may represent key diagnostic tools assessing sleep_quality subjective report may equally crucial indexing patient perceptions regarding sleep_quality
Notably patients reported evening type tended report severely disturbed sleep PSQI
clinical standpoint hospital_environment may less accommodating sleeping pattern raising possibility PSQI may capture aspect attitudes regarding difficulties attaining individual ideal sleeping pattern eg late morning awakening subpopulation
notable actigraphy analysis revealed relatively high durations time spent bed patient sample mean hr groups compared studies populations Matuskey al Wallen al
contrast previous_studies sample included patients schizophrenia population may increased sleep duration
Notably increased duration resulted sleep efficiency levels value thought within normal range shorter durations sleep despite patients subjective reports disturbed subjective sleep_quality
Unfortunately possible accurately link patient self-reported sleep logs actigraphy data instead observational nursing rounds used adjust bed times reviewing automatically generated sleep periods
patient sleep logs may suffered inaccuracies due difficulty recalling duration sleep period exacerbated burden illness among participants
Many participants also napped frequently extended period throughout day activity difficult participants chart accurately
Finally although significant reduction latency fall asleep move latency general appears underestimated values comparatively small considering previous findings control carefully latency Baune al
Interestingly patients circadian rhythms within new building less regular autocorrelation value cycle period hr decreased old facility
Notably severe mental_illness may_cause disruptions neurological circadian timings result highly irregular metabolically cued sleeping patterns Pritchett al Indeed forcing sleep rhythm onto individual might countertherapeutic effect decreasing sleep_quality despite appearance regular sleeping pattern
primary limitation study sample consisted individuals heterogeneous often comorbid psychiatric disorders although result findings also likely generalize similar inpatient psychiatric facilities
Unfortunately given severity illness comorbidity population burden current study protocol approach diagnostic interview conducted enroll single specific diagnosis would feasible
would excluded many participants resulting selection subset patients cognitively well enough endure lengthy assessment battery representative larger population
Paired samples also impossibility given average length_stay patients patients studied old building moved new building
second limitation conflicting subjective objective results
Although findings supported previous literature identifying difference two ideally improvements would observed demonstrated correlation
Conclusion recent move hospital older building dorm-style rooms new_facility private sleeping quarters provided unprecedented opportunity systematically objectively assess high level ecological validity clinical value new evidence-based_design features psychiatric_inpatients

however findings diverged level falls Chan al
finding greater number_falls corridors compared present_study
difficult draw firm conclusion based results
Differences length corridors traffic patterns facilities level lighting visibility well patient demographics may influenced results
important note design location corridors hallways support ambulatory patients inadvertently create fall hazards
Patient Rooms Bathrooms patient_rooms bathrooms environment viewed extrinsic factor contributing falls inadequate lighting poor spatial_layout ill-conceived adjacencies patient bedroom bathroom
According one sentinel reports instance patients want use bathroom middle night may reluctant walk distance required go beds threshold room main light switch located turn lights instead patients often walk bathroom darkness risking fall
patient inability easily control lighting complicates functioning ability perform regular activities would able well-lit room
Poor lighting increase risk falls Vu Weintraub Rubenstein adequate lighting benefit special populations geriatric disabled patients Lopez al
psychiatric settings majority falls occur patients walk bathroom night Tsai Witte Radunzel Keller
However much evidence clarifying level lighting considered adequate setting Gulwadi Calkins
many sentinel_event narratives uneven flooring surfaces ie transition carpeting linoleum level changes ie threshold sheet vinyl tile flooring identified problematic
Uneven flooring identified falling hazard previous_studies Lopez al
Therefore new flooring installations repairs existing floors eg retiling sections flooring call careful attention ensure level flooring surfaces alleviate falls
study falls bed third highest type fall patient_rooms
example unassisted effort sit get bed result slipping rolling bed whether asleep awake
dangers falling patients try get bed unassisted reported elsewhere Lee Mills Watts
Although efforts taken hospital_staff monitor attempts patients another strategy calls minimizing potential injury caused falls providing bedside mats buffer potential accidents Lee al
strategies include specifying bedrails bed heights bed alarms
However options always fail-safe example research use bed rails hospital_settings show significant decline frequency falls ironically design intervention may actually exacerbate severity bed fall injury O Keeffe
Lower bed heights introduced patient safeguard Joint Commission since lower height enables patients touch floor however literature_review conducted Hignett Masud unable corroborate influence bed height frequency severity fall
Another strategy reducing falls beds use bed alarms
However study Tideiksaar Feiner Maby found use bed alarms failed identify significant difference fall frequency control intervention groups
Furthermore staff general may supportive bed alarms considered easy-to-use effective consequently often deactivated extended periods time hospitals Lopez al
present_study handrails grab bars contributed falls reported patients inconveniently located absent key locations bathrooms
absence handrails relatively well-substantiated associated fall risks especially elderly
finding established across context residential settings Marshall al health_care facilities Lopez al
Unlike somewhat inconclusive findings regarding bed rails bed heights bed alarms tactic install grab bars accident-prone locations facilities seem reduce risk falling
Yet important aware even grab bars pose hidden dangers
instance tragedy result grab bars bed rails lack anti-ligature features thus become aid suicide attempts
Finally study bathroom falls appear caused part overall layout space height commode sink level changes flooring thresholds
help prevent accidents bathroom areas design solutions called consider commodes easy access toilet seats facilitate ability sit get back greater ease safely manual flushes convenient height alternatively implement automatic flushes
narrative results describe falls flooring adequately slip-resistant cases tripping threshold bedroom bathroom becomes problem
extrinsic_factors become even dangerous patient medicated causing increased drowsiness dizziness
Corridors falls took_place corridors study
may explained part design hospital study
corridors relatively short surrounded staff service areas length time get one area facility another shorted patient movement throughout corridor could easily monitored
Overall shorter corridors conjunction positioning staff areas seemed reduce patient_falls hallways see
researchers advocated shorter travel distances in-patient hospitals effective strategy reducing falls among psychiatric_patients Lee al
length patient travel distance facility influences level patient_falls layout spaces overall size unit Lee al
Narratives pointed patients use corridors social space
hallways patients engage others even racing one end hall
Given relatively narrow width corridors patient walking quickly may fall even run another patient staff_member turn falls
course using corridors power walking racing dangerous might signal lack adequate patient recreation
psychiatric_patients discouraged spend_time alone rooms limited opportunities entertainment secured environment incumbent caregivers staff provide places corridors patient activities
Dayrooms Falls relatively infrequent dayrooms study compared spaces
falls reported dayrooms furniture often culprit narrated sentinel_event_reports
Furniture placement could become tripping hazard patients could slide chairs tumble sharp edge times patients fell furniture slid furniture tumbled furniture cases patient_falls ambulating resulted nonenvironmental factors seizure interaction intrinsic extrinsic_factors
short falling complex issue fall prevention lend easy solutions
found study physical_environment one factor contributing falls categorically separated human organizational factors
fall event may artifact one contributing causes ranging intrinsic human factors extrinsic organizational environmental influences
Although falls might heavily influenced physiological condition root cause falls could traced combination human organizational environmental_factors play
research called explore relative importance factors association typical patient_fall scenarios
Limitations Although accessing retrospective data provided invaluable opportunity explore fall patterns time collected data allow inferential statistical analysis
Lack information patient treatment approaches medications allow control related risk factors played role patient_falls
amount time patients spent type space whether role frequency falls also unknown
times sentinel_event narratives lacked detailed information environmental_design features might strengthened results
Therefore effects environmental_design falls study may underestimated
Furthermore sentinel_event_reports may somewhat misrepresented location falls case sentinel_events occurring dayrooms adjacent corridors given adjacency
Specifically hospital study dayrooms designed relatively spacious areas opened corridors circulation spaces
reason falls may designated occurring dayroom instead corridors vice versa
Another shortcoming study diagnostic information total resident population available
Since permission access patients diagnosis information limited patients fell excluded fall possible correlate patient diagnoses fall patterns
sentinel_events provide gender patient limited conclusions drawn gender
collected data allow identification chronic fallers could represented disproportionate share falls
importantly data single case_study generalized population psychiatric_hospitals however issues raised extrinsic fall factors important directing research
Conclusion Reducing patient_falls improving patient_safety essential today health_care system
Psychiatric patient_falls greater frequency severity compared patient populations
Although may partially due use psychotropic drugs environment appears play role number_falls occurring associated patient injuries

Challenges faced
Nurses faced three_main challenges implementing intervention
First funding available within_hospital owing financial constraints
nurses deterred made numerous funding applications various external sources grant awarded
Time allocation proved difficult CNM undertake multiple roles including refurbishment co-ordinator project lead researcher addition duties ward manager
Finally time Phase III conducted many in-patients cognitive impairments unable complete survey
using recreation_room unable provide feedback
attempt overcome challenge data_collection extended facilitate completing many questionnaires possible
Conclusions practical implications little literature providing recreational facilities patients experiencing prolonged stays acute hospitals
Ensuring quality_care necessitates requirement good quality_life patient

QI_projects sustainable associated nurse leader involvement staff engagement Zoutman Ford
Frontline staff play key role ensuring room continues fulfil function recreation facility leadership managing room used
Limitations small exploratory QI_project specific setting therefore findings generalised hospital_settings

However project aimed explore longstay patient recreation comfort acute hospital develop specifically designated recreation_room specific ward area limitation would negligible effects
Hackshaw indicates well-designed small studies acceptable results interpreted care
Voluntary participation means potential non-response bias
Owing medical condition fewer patients anticipated able take_part post-refurbishment survey limiting patient voice however participated reviewed intervention positively

Thus design appeared impact multi-professional_team cooperation team_meetings patient reviews
appeared design significant came work conducted power distributed
Meetings small rooms SU headed member staff whose room person determined would discussed could talk long meeting would run
Since small rooms intended meetings certain interruptions extra chairs brought
Furthermore setting appeared prevent participation team_members example physicians spoke backs towards team_members accessing medical records conducive face-to-face discussions
team_meetings took_place specially designed conference seminar rooms SU_SU allowed members multi-professional_team gather around oval rectangular table face-to-face communication
addition rooms dedicated team_meetings made confidentiality possible

Designating room meetings enabled multi-professional teams work without interruption lack visibility corridors conducive teamwork

situations everyone able eye contact patient
Discussion study showed design physical_environment could impact multi-professional_teamwork stroke_unit
physical_environment always designed based existing evidence factors considered facilitate teamwork eg
design facilitates face-to-face communication appropriate spaces allow members work together
observations physical_environment multi-professional_teamwork lead careful consideration since importance multi-professional team-based care rehabilitation emphasised repeatedly stroke guidelines acts unequivocal evidence improved outcomes
Stroke teams larger many healthcare teams include wide_range professionals physicians nurses_nurse_assistants physio-occupational speech therapists coordination effective collaboration important however collaboration reportedly difficult accomplish
Therefore important continue careful study environment contribute teamwork facilitation
present_study despite large number observations situations two members multi-professional_team working together patient present rarely observed
result worrying difficult achieve coordinated care plan patient team make coherent assessment time meeting care jeopardised team_members attend meeting
relationship professionals patients requires communication structures encourage patients express expectations goals preferences
every patient meeting patients must regarded partners team involved decision-making process care
recent systematic_review benefit single versus multi-bedroom design persons neurological disorders stroke find strong evidence support refute single room_design
Based findings_study may case multi-professional_team works together patients single bedroom could best physical_environment enhance patient participation since allows high level confidentiality
commonly nurse nurse_assistant observed together mostly patient_room
result surprising nurses_nurse_assistants traditionally worked together bedside care activities also largest professional groups participate patient_care h day
Another explanation might undefined meaning teamwork units
research shown teamwork suffer lack clarity terms work relationships team interactions especially physical_environment designed team interaction
study shows importance physical_environment comes face-to-face communication
Often team_members sit backs towards one_another
cases rooms small primary function seemed workplace designed people
newly published review visual connectivity size space presence large rooms space team_members shown strengthen communication team_members
also_found centrally placed visible workplaces acted hub unit
hubs placed middle corridors designed communication short meetings staff multi-professional_team
spatial relationship centrally placed workstation near patient_rooms shown foster strong interactions collaborative communication within team
Even hubs observed units seemed good places communication appropriate activities required confidentiality
Open visible workplaces important facilitating communication interactions simultaneously essential secure confidentiality sharing information patients
results also showed none included_stroke_units space members multi-professional_team meet work together team room could closed door
could also observe various professionals workplaces ie
clear division different workplaces appeared fully support multi-professional_team activities
Earlier research showed shared locations professional proximity necessary factors successful teamwork co-location render repeated engagement sharing patient information exploring different perspectives
Furthermore physical_environment divided different rooms different professions make team communication poor incomplete
finding particular importance since good communication fundamental safe care thus central increasing patient_safety
better communication therefore physie
meeting rooms eg
equipped supporting technology common workplaces
One important finding power imbalance physical_environment
Sometimes power imbalance appeared emphasised design placement furniture
cases physical_environment support team activities members team could participate contribute care rehabilitation patient
Previous studies also indicated context team meeting held important balance power
Tyson al
suggest physical_environment ambient features promote communication balance power room eg
using large seminar rooms table centre large space team member whiteboard wall large screen
However professionals working physical_environment automatically generate team cooperate
One factor impacts teamwork hierarchies healthcare
recent_study Green al
factors contributing healthcare hierarchies included person position within team eg
professional speciality sex personality introvert extrovert increased responsibility orders within professions professionalism
importance factors reduce need study physical_environment important_factor understanding teams work communicate better
Rather physical_environment part understanding organisation environment interact support team activities rather hierarchies well-designed environment promotes equal conversations
Strengths limitations results study built qualitative quantitative data large number observations full days strengthens study
research_design data_collection valuable provided opportunity address questions complex phenomena physical_environment
Another strength observations performed using well-established method behavioural_mapping semi-structured observations predefined observation guide used
minimise risk unsought preconceptions detailed field_notes allowed us reach deeper understanding context observations
Field notes valuable prompted close observations environment interactions
limitation acknowledged unstructured observations might informal meeting places team without patient present observed
Another limitation behaviour mapping provided picture patient patient_room
may occasions staff_work together example outside patient_room either without patient present
Conclusion design physical_environment play significant role multi-professional_teamwork
physical_environment support multi-professional_team reinforcing good communication power distribution
design may include shared workstation allowing team_members meet communicate face face
time understand incorporate existing evithe physical_environment stroke_units
Hence physical_environment incorporated stroke guidelines important component stroke_care

Yes thought okay really put much effort us coming
gave great feeling embraced Informant
describing feelings women made associations recognizable home-like_environment
Feeling welcome appeared closely associated women_experience emotional_support comfort reduction stress uncertainty experienced Table Main themes sub-themes Themes Sub-themes Emotional support Feeling welcome Midwife room inseparability Involvement partner Feeling equal space partner Physical comfort Positive distractions Capturing room connection admission birth
None women study expressed experiences stressful elements limitations induced spoken unspoken rules governing room
physical_environment seemed support women_experience vital part organization entered especially important patient-centered approach supported
Moreover seemed make women adapt easily room transition home hospital
Midwife room inseparability low-risk births Denmark care led certified midwife attended medical psychosocial care needs
participants received one-on-one care
relationship midwife ability provide emotional_support appeared highly significant women birth_experiences
cases positive relationship established midwife woman experience environment appeared depend relationship physical_features
data show women_experiences physical_environment affected amplified sometimes restricted quality relationship midwife
alternative birthing environment also seemed influence midwives practices engagement couple effect midwife room appeared inseparable
Many women study emphasized midwife ability small talk way involved life perspective experience
seemed strengthen relationship couple midwife interpreted sign equality
instance one woman said Well wasn sitting writing present birth could also talk things super nice
also makes little human
simply amazing
s nothing better people share little bit
somehow calms really Informant women gave examples room audial visual stimuli created opportunities small talk perceived calming
However women study_also expressed need guidance midwife found unknown territory overwhelmed pain
One women spoke many describing experience guidance really needed remember staring intensely eyes
good keeping gaze helping breathing everything
like know surrendered Informant data indicate general midwifes working alternative_delivery_room successful helping women surrender birth process guide sense physical_psychological control
However amply spaced room physical facilities also facilitated another form emotional_support allowed midwife retreat offer private_space couple remaining available
women valued occasional professional retreat opportunity gave find strength close connectedness partner maintaining feeling safety cared
following quote typical Really good thing almost without us seeing
sitting like corner
could talk sorts things things didn know
think really completely
really reason felt great
Informant possibility midwives change closeness respectful distance seemed increase women confidence abilities sense_control
One woman explained think felt also could manage well actually think good combination made seem natural could feel ones chargeso could feel comfortable yes well made_feel safe knew anyway calm made less stressful
Informant opportunity create privacy unobtrusive way provides key example room enabled midwives adapt different situations
Moreover environment seemed majority cases support preserve midwives ability provide sensitivity individual variations essential ensuring patients experience emotional_support
However women overall birth_experience overshadowed experience insufficient emotional_support midwives
reported poor communication misinterpretation needs led anxiety feelings powerlessness
instance one woman described frustration thought aren anyone going help
Midwife job say Well take breast and NOTHING
felt_like worst mother ever earth
know going get breastfeed got afraid know completely naked smooth
felt stupidIt ruined whole experience birth
Informant seemed emphasize known patient_centered approach patients emotional needs met usual resilience ability cope stressful situation compromised
birth_environment thus seems subordinate womancaregiver relationship women assessment birth_experiences
Involvement partner Feeling equal Overall woman spoke positively partner role found important psychological state mind labor
highly valued opportunities offered room interact partner natural everyday manner
Many said promoted sense equality strengthened couple working together found alleviated anxiety
One woman description experience typical together know
wasn like us
re sitting together m sitting way lying damn bed
makes world difference getting bed
re patient
didn feel_like patient walked around sat cushion area
re together
Informant data clearly indicate sofa_bed key feature major asset room
women talked excitedly role overall experience even_though varied whether used birth participant used birth although also possible
sofa_bed facilitated physical contact woman_partner strengthened experience intimacy closeness partner women saw stimulating sense partnership
typical comment sitting right side sofa
could feel presence
could feel legs gave sense security tranquility
know re together even m hard work
Anyway alongside feeling great
Informant Maintaining intimacy equal key women general experience high level psychosocial support partner
interpretation data seems women partner way together room must experienced physical_environment signal encourage allowing partner degree involved care woman childbirth
considered essential aspect patient-centered_care supports family-centered approach clearly great meaning women
space partner women expressed consistent consideration partner well-being labor
sofa_bed highly valued increased comfort partner offering physical_psychological space
relaxing effect allowed withdraw rest needed
contributed reducing women concerns stress stemming concern partner wellbeing
One woman explained way corner made difference father actually felt great well
felt_like worry
thought really nice means something
person ve got room know someone extremely fond Informant sofa area afforded partner occasional retreat couple chance relax individually different ways without separated
women thus felt partner always present needed
women seemed experience sofa_bed explicit sign environment acknowledged partner needs also experienced supportive women needs
Physical comfort Positive distractions women visual auditory stimuli captured attention helpful coping labor maintaining sense_control
Several women described feeling inside bubble coping labor expressed one woman really nice know peace watching projected images
Somehow m inside bubble

really felt_like bubble
really helped keep going know maintaining relaxed state wanted achieve also turned really good
Informant Many women able recall state mind body labor associated relaxation joy
stimuli elicited positive emotions birth_environment associated important aspects couples daily lives
instance one woman said landscape images made recall experiences hunting kind liked watching
talked lot also midwife really nice Informant Many distractions childhood memories beach described women partners
Although enjoy reminders important aspects daily lives positive social_interaction landscapes sounds given rise
majority women furthermore emphasized positive_effect room lighting
following quote typical light calming think
Like stress know kind relaxing good feeling nothing feel bad know
weren waiting afraid something bad might happen way might hospital
Informant general warm dimmed light room contributed women sense comfort safe environment
Overall used perceived light distractions differently
women register audial visual distractions labor still emphasized overall positive contribution stimuli creating positive ambience
women found audial visual distraction compromised ability relax
However women partners given control sound light projected landscapes according current needs stressful situations avoided
Regardless initiative tacking physical_environment support physical_comfort safeguarding woman_partner autonomy therefore significant environmental factor support patient_centered approach
Capturing room Many women surprised find ambience room gave sense empowerment actively autonomously exploring room facilities
typical remark kind felt try capture room way
Instead sitting watching sudden found quite exciting made_feel comfortable Informant tranquility physical_comfort provided room seemed stimulate women partners move around freely explore different spaces relaxation pain relief without feeling need ask staff permission help
many women found well-being bathtub walking_around adapting different positions close partner sofa_bed also_found traditional_hospital bed helpful
environment seemed support recommendation patient_centered approach explicitly address expand patients opportunity individualcontrolled options pain relief
However women gave birth traditional_hospital bed even_though many expressed would rather giving_birth bathtub sofa_bed
Many factors may causing however women know reason behind decision give_birth traditional_hospital bed could suggest exploration possibilities alternative_birth positions communication regarding depends guiding midwife
Discussion high level patient-centered_care documented women predominantly positive perception alternative_birth environment
Overall results therefore corroborate research indicating welldesigned physical settings play important_role making hospitals safer healing
analysis shown women_experiences physical_environment alternative_delivery_room relates several dimensions concept patient_centered care
Three main_themes developed Emotional support Involvement family Physical comfort especially four key factors within environment contributed high level patientcentered care
Firstly ease transition alternative home-like hospital setting seemed strengthen women_experience emotional well physical well-being
possible explanation might comfortable familiar environment known promote feelings safety confidence sense self strengthening effect women physiological functioning emotional well-being
environment therefore seemed convey atmosphere dignity respect sensitivity toward women psychological_needs essential element patient_centered care could facilitator progress birth
Secondly women partners also offered physical_psychological space room hereby relieving well-known worries repercussions relatives often experienced patients
described sharing experience labor_birth partner extremely important women
value partner presence support women birth_experiences documented studies also suggested factor slows process labor women may find harder relax partner side
However study women experienced sofa_bed significant feature supportive relaxation women partner
experienced possibility offered facilities partners providers emotional physical support labor_birth also great importance informants
order support real involvement families explicit encouragement within environment family needs however also entail health professional seek deeper exploration partners individually expressed needs
partners experience however within scope study focusing women_experience
Thirdly women found environment helped obtain physical_comfort encouraged active behavior may offer psychological benefits coping labor relaxation feeling control
shown Raynor England progress labor_birth facilitated access control variety ways obtaining physical_comfort labor_birth
Literature also described psychological benefits positive_distractions helps people attend stimuli rather discomfort anxiety
study women women also_found joy relaxation positive_distractions
However importantly autonomy offered respect physical_features avoided potential stressful situations
According needs women experienced overall free seek support partner midwife left alone feature patient-centered_care also considered offer protection patients autonomy promote family centered care
Safeguarding woman_partner autonomy therefore significant environmental factor also shown support progress labor therefore advantageously preserved thought future hospital_settings quality_care
Finally alternative_delivery_room overall appeared elicit positive supportive relationships couples midwife enabling midwives explore respect women psychological_needs seem amplified women positive_experiences birth_environment
study thereby suggest environment midwives play important_role women achieving physical_comfort sense_control
also supported studies showing women trust midwife ability control labor tend experience pain reducing factors known neurobiological positive effects natural birth
Even_though essential findings within women_experiences found related three_main themes mentioned dimension patient_centered care also indirectly represented women_experience eg
respecting patients values needs integration care information communication
However understandings dimension transition continuity found interpretation women_experiences
Strengths limitations individual in-depth interviews thematic focus produced rich data offering new insights women_experiences birth_alternative delivery_room ability support patient-centered_care
Data saturation achieved interviews line authors reporting data saturation twelve interviews
however fully achieve aim great variation study_participants key characteristics thus perspectives experiences
instance none single young mothers born outside Denmark disadvantaged social position
sample however closely reflect characteristics women already enrolled RCT medical birth_outcomes informants recruited
greater variety among participant characteristics may contributed data variety finding may less transferable single women womencouples another cultural background less advantageous life circumstances
Another potential limitation lies great professional public interest alternative_delivery_room prior study may influenced women preunderstandings expressed views
interviewer addressed constant awareness ensuring adequate depth interviews
Furthermore reflexivity interviewer role preconception discussed authors stages research process
study adds findings added evidence positive influence hospital_environment design patients psychological physical well-being thereby psychosocial outcomes care
study furthermore offers new insights alternative_delivery_room inspired principles healing architecture Snoezelen help encourage service providers deliver patient-centered_care many hospitals health_care institutions base practices
Implications practice findings support use principles healing architecture Snoezelen development evidence based birthing environments
consider apply also rooms used preliminary examination
Special attention given ensuring space woman_partner couple physical emotional interaction upholding women autonomy use facilities increase relaxation physical_comfort
However ensuring maintaining one-on-one care appears crucial women saw midwifecouple relationship psychosocial support offered midwife key factor birth_experience
Conclusion general women found positive_experiences giving_birth alternative_birth environment
environment appeared encompass several dimensions concept patientcentered care
Overall physical_environment accommodated many women individual psychological_needs eg
facilitating easy transition hospital reduced stress anxiety
environment furthermore seemed provide_opportunities physical_comfort relaxation helped women cope sense_control
women placed great emphasis ability alternative_delivery_room support needs also partner
likewise stressed psychosocial support interaction partner
However attention given ensure maintain one-onone care midwife psychosocial support appeared key women birth_experiences inseparable alternative_birth environment
factors appeared highly interdependent
findings thus support development patient-centered birth environments future hospital_design promote physical_psychological wellbeing woman_partner

Conclusions paper outlines steps taken conduct exploratory EBD_research study designed find whether wayfinding_aids applied along school_corridor would increase ability children_ASD find_way along set route minimal verbal physical assistance
results experiment detailed subject separate paper
Detailed key lessons learned process conducting experiment
Logistics One main challenges conducting study logistics
time take gain asynchronous approval SD IRB back SD additional amendments required time-consuming negotiation revision many months
Manufacturing installing wayfinding_aids also laborious task additional assistance required
Researchers aware experiment nature lengthy process plan accordingly
Collaboration Conducting EBD_research school environment participants ASD achieved researcher alone
requires collaboration cooperation many ARCH different parties parentsguardians children SD personnel teachers janitorial staff etc
researcher also prepared compromise needs SD maintaining integrity study purpose
Also experiment site unexpected issues arise eg
participant sick rescheduled
items mitigated eg
check beforehand see fire alarm test scheduled
researcher needs adaptable site situations
Number participants inherent problem conducting research children_ASD finding sufficient participants
Despite data indicating children diagnosis ASD Baio al finding large numbers suitable participants one school easy
Added children lower end spectrum may unable take_part
Also children sick refuse take_part
Expanding age range keeping selection criteria open possible effective measures increase participant numbers
Holding research Summer_Program increasing number potential_participants one place drawback attendance mandatory potential_participants holiday otherwise unavailable
Characteristics children_ASD variability characteristics children_ASD study meant behaviors unpredictable children distracted continually reminded keep task silent throughout
Classroom observations useful framing behaviors
Time measure success lacked validity three participants ambulatory difficulties recorded educational records thus took longer complete study
unclear whether additional participants would provided synergy yet variability
Limitations decision made use typically developing children pre-test reasons outlined
Post study support view since findings indicated children_ASD varied much wayfinding behavior foreseen circumstances could identified
Also normal school situation doors would generally open passing times would obscure door color
situation additional matching strip colored material could applied around door frame color would visible doors open
Future research Future research could expand larger wayfinding study school used children_ASD environments visit eg hospital store
procedures used_study could applied test variables schools eg effects lighting classroom layout
research experiments testing environmental treatments could provide professionals EBD findings design schools suitable children_ASD
Summary One drivers study current lack EBD_research design environments suitable children_ASD
documenting detail steps taken conduct research study_aimed lay foundation researchers could apply similar experiments
hoped encourage researchers adapt conduct similar research elsewhere

Another critical gap design research lack established theory concerning interior_design Thomson Ulrich_al
Although multidisciplinary perspectives improve research broaden scope discipline researchers keep encouraged theory building specific discipline Clemons Eckman
However reality majority studies interior_design field developed theoretical frameworks Bae al
addition gap exists research healthcare_environments gap lack methodologically rigorous studies leading low level evidence Huisman al
Although conducting research physical_environments impact people wellness increasing design fields still many studies conducted health-related fields eg medical field rather design fields eg interior_design field
limited attempts design fields explore relationships environments wellness even frequently criticized lack rigor Huisman al
Moreover experimental studies regarded rigorous studies observational studies observational studies able demonstrate social phenomena specific times interpreted causal relationships whereas results experimental studies generate cause effect relationships Sullivan
conclusion ambient_scent environments tested various populations based health_status diverse environments eg hospitals rehabilitation units residences rigorous study designs
Therefore fill current gap body knowledge study designed examine ambient_scent environments rehabilitation settings eg long-term_care units improve residents wellbeing via experimental study

Discussion one inexpensive noninvasive complementary alternative medicine CAM methods aromatherapy frequently applied positive impacts especially impact lavender mood continuously explored Ndao al S anchez-Vidan a_al
specific recent previous literature reported positive_impact lavender people mood anxiety_depression Karadag al
However results present_study showed placebo_effect ambient_scent_environment residents depression

addition regression_analyses showed statistically_significant interaction effect intervention baseline depression score
placebo result might indicate presence positive_distraction ie presence decorative jar effective improving mood scented environment per se jar may allow participants shift focus negative foci restorative aspects nonmedical world
placebo could also result presence jar suggesting aromatherapy
placebo_effect lavender aromatherapy reported previous literature Chamine Oken
specific recent_study found placebo_effect lavender_essential_oil anxiety spite different populations study Franco al
authors conducted randomized study placebo control_group explore whether lavender_essential_oil effective reduce female patients anxiety_levels breast surgery
results found patients intervention_placebo groups statistically lower anxiety_levels indicating placebo_effect lavender_essential_oil
authors suggested placebo_effect involved terms decrease anxiety among control_group received nonscent aromatherapy
effect lavender aromatherapy people mood still debated among scholars
systematic_review papers results showing improvement mood found results indicating negative impacts insignificant differences Lee al
example one recent_study found decreased depression levels among community-living older_adults -week aromatherapy Xiong al
However authors explored three_different aroma scents including lavender study placebo_group
Therefore studies able test placebo_effect even_though positive_impact may associated placebo_effect
present_study looked interaction effects intervention variables eg baseline scores ventilation distance SF building however able detect significant measurable interaction effects intervention moderating variables
words different distance_ventilation_system statistically_significant association intervention changes depression
Also different SF buildings results
enough variation within moderating variables may lead results
specific room configuration ie distance_ventilation SF similar rooms Building especially identical layouts
low value standard deviations distance_ventilation ft intervention_placebo SF ft intervention_placebo may indicate similar layouts across three buildings Table
Finally narrow ranges variations may provide enough information detect moderating roles impact lavender scent_environment
Even_though statistically meaningful relationship_built environment lavender_essential_oil impact mood found study first explore built_environments moderating effect aromatherapy
Hence additional research investigating potential relationship_built environment aromatherapy desired
Limitation Unfortunately study significant limitations many studies conducted impact_ambient_scent_environment
First single-blind study present_study design limitation regarding observer bias participants know allocation investigator knew participant allocation
Since data_collected oneon-one conversation participant investigator blinded participants responses might affected interaction investigator
Hence whether remained blinded throughout_study still questionable
Secondly control_group receive treatment may problematic regarding representativeness
already agreed participate study signed consent form may favorable opinion ambient_scent_environment
placebo_effect could result participation study
Therefore double-blind studies conducted minimize potential observer bias increase representativeness participants
third limitation small_number participants recruited study
study met statistical power baseline N however participants analyzed follow-up
Therefore statistical power results threatened
addition participants recruited three_different buildings two_different long-term_care_facilities
Although participants randomly_assigned either group using stratified randomization many potential confounders exist due different environmental settings eg service building layout staff
Moreover deviation environmental setting eg distance_ventilation SF small across participants investigate moderating role built_environment impact_ambient_scent_environment
Another limitation study possible environmental_factors associated dependent variables ie depression considered
example number family visits may associated depression levels
However present_study collect environmental_factors
intensity dilution fifth limitation
study dilution used lavender_essential_oil less dilution preferred elderly Worwood Worwood
However dilution may strong enough find impact lavender scent
addition study ask whether caregivers perceived scent demonstrate perceivable dilution
stronger dilution used_study different results might found
Furthermore level volatile component essential_oil considered although would affect strength scent duration exposure intervention
standard regarding dilution available practice yet S anchez-Vidan a_al future studies additionally explore setting standard regarding dilution investigate impact different dilution wellness
addition spatial attributes eg open closed door average duration stay room considered factors may affect impact aromatherapy participants
Whether doors opened closed would affect distribution ambient_scent within room outside room
way would eventually change duration diffuse scent participant disturb implementing identical intervention participants might fully exposed intervention
study count duration participant spent room day
participants might spend_time common area room would also influence duration exposure intervention
Lastly improvement depression may result changes time
possible participants recovering illness mood improved result
Although participants stayed least month time participation study examine long facilities participant health diagnosis chronic diseases acute diseases
Therefore information participants health trajectory considered
would interesting measure GDS three points ie weeks intervention beginning intervention end intervention study potential impact time GDS improvement
Concurrently future studies focus impact_ambient_scent_environment overcoming limitations mentioned
Rigor previous_studies concerning ambient_scent_environment often critiqued researchers methodological limitation made researchers uncertain impact_ambient_scent_environment cautious findings previous literature
Therefore impact_ambient_scent_environment people wellness still inconclusive among scholars
Forthcoming research conducted methodological rigor build current literature_review addressing limitations mentioned present_study
Also majority studies ambient_scent_environment conducted medical fields rather design fields
One considerable problems interior_design field lack theory within field leading limited studies developed theoretical frameworks Bae al
Future studies developed theoretical_framework interior_design field focus impact_ambient_scent_environment interior_design perspectives
efforts enhance current literature interior_design discipline contribute theory building within field

Implications Practice Positive_distraction built_environments improve residents mood long-term_care_facilities
Even_though ambient_scent_environment study enough find significant improvement residents mood placebo_effect positive_distraction room
might indicate presence positive_distraction ie oil jar effective improving mood scented environment
Although study_found built_environment might significant relationship impact_ambient_scent_environment improvement mood something positive_distractions built_environment helpful residents mood
Therefore bringing something new residents environment may create emotionally supportive environments
