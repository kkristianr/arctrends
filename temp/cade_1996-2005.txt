However relatively little interest shown therapeutic potential psychiatric architecture
empirical studies evaluated effects psychoenvironmental design shown encouraging results
Higgs example found decrease pathological behavior following move schizophrenic patients modernized unit
Gabb al
demonstrated positive influence interior design public psychiatric facility creation supportive stabilized environment schizophrenic patients
Christenfeld al
showed selective behavior attitude changes among staff patients transition remodeled ward compared matched control wards
Notably one changes significant decrease rate patient violence
Stahler al
found increase patient-staff interaction decrease pathological behavior together improved morale among patients_staff remodeling psychiatric geriatric ward
Whitehead al
measured behavioral changes clinically desirable atmosphere subsequent redesigning psychiatric unit
changes also correlated reduced psychopathology probably secondary betterment staff-patient contact
authors suggested even minor architectural changes lead significant improvement setting functions positive effects patients_staff families
Sommer Ross reported one earliest works issue doubling rate social interactions among geriatric patients following rearrangement furniture day room
Minde al

Findings above-mentioned studies well publications support speculation altered physical design variables consistent treatment philosophy would associated favorable changes staff patient perception ward atmosphere would therapeutic value
Indeed congruence patient staff perceptions psychiatric wards long considered necessary factor

Psychiatric Hospital integral part biggest medical center Israel
location within premises medical center allows ongoing interrelation dialogue medical staff Division Psychiatry wards
psychiatrists provide regular consultation-liaison services latter consult physicians wards nonpsychiatric medical issues
Patients suffering mental physical disorders often interacting share reciprocal clinical impact benefiting daily arrangement
location within general medical center also facilitates routine use laboratory brain imaging services thus enhancing level medical care
addition symbolizes medicalization psychiatry alleviates obvious apprehension patients families regarding admission psychiatric institute
daily clinical observation staff leaves doubt patients enjoy physical_environment offers safe comfortable nonthreatening readily comprehensible set surroundings
messages sent physical_environment convey sincere respect patient sensitive concern physiological psychological well-being important contributors therapeutic process
design inpatient wards adheres basic set guidelines ward_design patients overcrowded overconcentrated forced interact many people
given opportunity retreat physically feel threatened form beneficial relationships
latter achieved mainly providing variety spaces support social interaction big day room dining room well lit ventilated spacious lobby corridors whose design resembles living room residential furniture rather commonly used institutional pieces
open porches one-story building almost continuous lawn surrounds thus providing spaces social interaction creating free unthreatening atmosphere time helping define space
Generally seems patients_staff react positively classical daylight fresh air
nurses stations located front day rooms separated big windows usually open
noteworthy mention important negative finding study performed Whitehead al
small number patients spent time near open nurses station
Nurses often fear patients abuse easier access nurses station open
data study prove fear unrealistic
Moreover appears openness design may encourage staff leave station spend time day room
building well kept meticulous daily maintenance repairs carried promptly
essential especially vandalism accidental damage occurs constant maintenance discourages destruction
Safety psychiatric setting involves many aspects facility design
mention patient living area easily observed staff lighting patients rooms sufficient adequate staff observation evening night hours many exits could used case emergency building equipped smoke detectors fire extinguishing equipment
already mentioned environmental conditions important efficiency staff operation
staff working resting areas segregated provided separate entrances yet easily accessible patients relatives
Thus boundaries defined without suggesting alienation
unanimously agreed staff members physical_environment psychiatric_hospital contributes also quality life sense professional dignity workers
humane efficient containment reduction severe psychopathology major goal shared hospital designers clinicians administrators
model suggests psychoenvironmental approach psychiatric_hospital design provide important effective tool pursuit supports prediction planned environment may favorably impact patient staff

impact spaces built_environment upon health health care documented many authors number approaches discernible studies

Studies impact health care environment upon perceptions experiences well-being including patients recovery

Interactionist studies examine impact architecture engagements people inhabit spaces
Rawlings found problems communication personnel working surgical sterilization unit due physical boundaries layout Rawlings
spatial allocation patients casualty department analysed terms doctor nurse interactions Hughes

Structuralist approaches anthropology sociology examine spaces movements within spaces mirror otherwise symbolically represent activities go
Turner s study Ndembu people explored rites de passage associated sickness entailed complex movements Ardener considered use spatial isolation liengu rite used heal seizures among Cameroonian Bakweri
Rosengren DeVault examined spatial arrangements obstetrics passing mention spaces surgery made Hirschauer s Hirschauer analysis surgical bodies
Studies within tradition may distinguish ritual instrumental activities seek disclose deep structure beneath surface manifestations interactions LeviStrauss
approach adopted might best described post-structuralist eschews notion built_environment determining behavior one-to-one congruity architecture intended function space
Post-structuralism interested power relationship knowledge built_environment may contribute knowledge things behave may behave certain ways ascribed particular privilege
approach emphasizes reading spaces actors rather writing behavioural imperatives within physical structure built_environment Fox
Thus certain circumstances architecture may make available actors skein signs support discursive activities
example Prior writes design health care spaces best understood relation discursive practices disclosed interiors
architecture hospital therefore inextricably bound forms medical theorizing medical practice operant hour construction subsequent modifications hospital design seen product alterations medical discourse Prior p
Spaces may thus offer cues actors might engage environment others

BUILT ENVIRONMENT OPERATING THEATRE data reported study collected principally large teaching hospital called General Hospital
hospital surgery carried operating theatres organized five twin suites
diversity layout even one hospital thus may expected facilities may diverge however core features architecture may discerned Fig

General Hospital six theatres congruent designs
Two others congruent except scrub area divided operating area
two plastic surgery theatres designed around central sterile_corridor separated anaesthetic_room STt design ST arranged around central core area sterile_corridor
entrance corridor clearly marked off-limits patients visitors staff authorized enter form principal barrier boundary ST
Within barrier second set doors marks boundary beyond sterile conditions supposed apply within precautions taken reduce numbers infective organisms present floors disinfected personnel passing inner doors must first put plastic overshoes available box two sets doors
Observations life within ST suggest institution sterile_corridor principal means defining surgical space separate rest hospital
Nursing staff bringing patients theatre use route However personnel based ST use different means access
Either two sets doors via discretely marked staff entrance access obtained staff corridor leads changing_rooms
Changing rooms contain washing toilet facilities stocks sterile clothing
Suitably garbed personnel able enter sterile_corridor via internal door changing_rooms
back spaces back space
theatre within twin suite possesses anaesthetic_room scrub areas shares instrument preparation disposal facilities
latter spaces situated two theatres suite provide means access theatres without passing sterile_corridor
area consisting theatres instrument preparation areas along scrub areas forms inner sanctum within ST access limited specific personnel clean side instrument preparation area accessible sterile_corridor sterile instruments Central Sterile Supplies Department CSSD hospital unpacked arranged sterile trolleys subsequently wheeled theatre via corridor STs
Used instruments returned dirty side via hatchway towards rear ST replaced packs arrived returned due course CSSD
Scrub areas contain washing facilities stocks sterile gowns gloves masks use surgeons scrub nurses
areas comprise recovery room post-operative patients areas use staff offices doctors theatre sister rest room equipment stock rooms
ST thus virtually autonomous hospital STs all-day lists conducted arrangements made provide snack luncheon staff obviating need leave ST am late afternoon
Telephones situated sterile_corridor offices bleep system permit limited contact outside world maintained although also effectively kept distance claiming pressure urgent work done ST Informants told researcher one pleasures working surgery inaccessibility
effect sterile_corridor separating ST outside noted informants Infection Control Nurse Danger infection used excuse expense architectural arrangement precautions also effective keeping unwanted people theatre
Within ST operating_table centrally placed
movable anaesthetics trolley situated one end connected various pipes providing oxygen anaesthetic gases
orientation patient therefore limited need anaesthetic access surgical anaesthetic areas theatre mutually exclusive
SPACE STERILITYIN ST Sterility key element organizing activity within ST area analysed three concentric spaces increasing hygiene

general environs ST comprising areas described earlier marked offlimits except involved one way another activities ST
area efforts made adopt sterile procedures example avoiding contact surfaces street clothing shoes

ST may entered garbed surgical clothing comprising greens linen shirt trousers skirt clogs boots cap surgical hood theory least surgical mask
Clothing supplies provided changing_rooms may accessed entrances ST complex avoiding sterile_corridor
changing_rooms contiguous outside world thus liminal status Turner

sterile field surrounding operating_table patient
Anyone approaching area wear surgical gown sterile rubber gloves surgical mask
Furthermore personnel area must first undergone ritual scrubbing hands forearms
gloved hands must touch anyone anything sterile including mask cap
Patients considered non-sterile transformed sterile objects draping towelling neck toe
Parts patient immediately adjacent site proposed incision area washed disinfectant iodine sterilized towels draped leave small rectangular area skin exposed
sterile adhesive plastic material may stuck skin surrounding towels incisions made membrane underlying skin enhancing sterility area immediately adjacent wound
Towelling may augmented non-porous paper barrier placed conventional cloth towelling

worth noting sterile practices intended protect patient surgical environment including personnel surgical garb may also protection staff contamination patients blood-borne diseases hepatitis HIV
work spaces surgical enterprise must learn rules ST many concern sterility theatre surrounding areas
Asepsis technology exclusion infective agents might contaminate sterile inside body surgery development built_environment ST past years reflects developments antisepsis asepsis Trites al Fox
requires objects come contact sterile field instruments clothes bodies must far possible germfree air contents environment surgical operation
practice course complete asepsis impossible procedures nowadays usually complemented pre-operative injections antibiotics
built_environment ST thus crucial aseptic technique two ways
Firstly demarcates sterile area general septic environment hospital
Thus within precincts ST sterile practices must observed meticulous rules dress behaviour required inhabit spaces
Secondly ST environment affects movements personnel patients instruments permissible according rules sterility
partly built architecture ST sense built_environment potentially guarantor inadvertent compromise aseptic procedures
call rules movement circuits_hygiene
CIRCUITS HYGIENE section consider movements things bodies ST detail circuits_hygiene interact spaces built_environment
movements may understood set technical rules aseptic procedure would suggest see circuits_hygiene something part covenant Laufman staff patients operate safely
circuits_hygiene thus rhetorical markers indicate done labelled form healing
would suggest markers valuable surgery risky business often almost always elective surgery subjective experience patient clinical view strictly speaking patient ill operation suffering pain discomfort wound physiological after-effects anaesthetic perhaps emotional distress
extreme patient may die result complications resulting surgical andor anaesthetic intervention
circuit hygiene represents imperative hygiene surgery maintained promoted
direction movement ensures successful hygiene ensues
Hygiene used double sense
narrower sense hygiene consists science sanitation cleanliness sterility
may designated hygieneI
However roots word hygiene wider according dictionary definition hygiene knowledge practice concerned promotion protection health deriving Hygeia goddess health daughter Aesculapius Greek mythology
hygiene
wider notion hygiene health appropriate understanding procedures conducted ST concerned restoration promotion health patients undergoing surgical healing
circuits_hygiene pertaining staff instruments act ensure hygiene also concerned hygiene transition patient herhis unhealthy status prior healing healthy status healed
patient_s circuit hygiene herhis movement surgical space perform status passage concerned foremost hygiene
Fig
arrows indicate direction instruments staff patients usually move
rules forms signs physical impedimenta govern directions permissible although course barriers form architectural construction limit possible movements
Yet clearly appear conventions lay staff patients instruments may move would considered extremely unusual probably dangerous patient instrument move unconventional direction
example scrub room may used thoroughfare conventional partly avoid disturbing patients awaiting anaesthetic induction anaesthetic_room seen domain anaesthetists assistant nurses used staff access ST even patient present
arbitrariness conventions pertaining staff obvious legitimacy activity may indeed depend upon carried
Field Notes trainee paramedic went coffee-break operation
returned cups coffee consultant anaesthetist Dr B researcher
Dr B researcher better take outside
consultants allowed drink coffee
However conventions altered Surgeon Mr P G new private hospital commissioned red line floor demarcated sterile areas ST
However inclusion coffee-room within boundary prevented surgeons colleagues dropping coffee thus disrupting convention hospital sociability
red line quickly re-painted exclude coffee room sterile area
separate three circuits somewhat artificial interaction concurrence contributes overall hygienic regime
circuits pertaining staff instruments described first followed lengthy description patient circuit necessarily involves staff instruments
staff circuit division labour within ST means different staff differing circuits following account recognizes variations
Personnel working ST surgeons anaesthetists theatre anaesthetic nurses operating department assistants ODAs students auxiliaries enter suite along non-sterile staff cor ridor entrance outside inner doors sterile_corridor SC
staff corridor enter men s women s changing_rooms equipped lavatory washing facilities shower supplies sterile clothing shoes masks caps
Personnel discard street clothes although seems acceptable retain socks underwear tights
Theatre clothes quite revealing whole procedure changing seems separate ST outside conventions modesty
Surgeons go wards wearing theatre greens take care fasten side vent trousers usually reveals bare flesh ST changed staff may enter sterile area includes rest rooms office stores telephone addition theatres associated facilities
kitchen ambiguous area sterile personnel prepare coffee access also possible non-sterile staff corridor auxiliaries perform domestic duties
noted earlier main access ST via scrub areas entrances patients removed theatre following operation
Anaesthetists assistants tend use anaesthetic_room means entry egress ST except accompanying patient ST Ward nurses porters work ST area seen outsiders although theatre staff dependent upon providing daily flow patients
Porters bring patients sterile_corridor main doors thence anesthetic room accompanied nurse patient_s ward
latter puts overshoes entering sterile area porters General Hospital appeared exempt rule possibly unlike ward nurses rare circumstances would enter theatre
Following completion duties staff pass back changing_rooms non-sterile world discarding used greens laundry baskets changing_rooms
