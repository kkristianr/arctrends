feelings_stress anxiety may affect healing process
Research shows example psychological stress impairs wound healing patients Kiecolt-Glaser al Broadbent al

Natural elements Research restorative environments suggests certain environments capable promoting recovery stress shows especially natural settings restorative effects Hartig al
Considering potential healing properties nature Ulrich Lohr Pearson-Mims exposing patients natural_elements may effective way reducing stress associated hospitalization
However healthcare_facilities built urban environments thus lack natural resources patients exposed
Bringing nature hospital might good alternative reduce stress patients turn aid recovery

Lohr Pearson-Mims studied whether presence_indoor plants would increase pain tolerance
Participants either placed room plants room non-plant objects visually distractive plants control room objects
Results showed significantly larger proportion respondents room plants able keep hand ice water minutes compared conditions suggesting increased pain tolerance exposure indoor_plants
also showed room plants rated positively eg cheerful calming pleasant either control rooms
results studies support idea indoor_plants may beneficial effects health_well-being people
Natural elements_built environment clearly shown stress-reducing properties still unclear underlying mechanism causes stress-reduction
potential explanation lies theories Kaplan Ulrich state people tendency prefer natural settings built_environments
Although two theories important differences see Hartig al
discussion based evolutionary assumptions
preferences natural settings assumed evolutionary base people extent biologically adapted natural opposed built_environments
Secondly might argued nature may processed easily efficiently brain sensory systems evolved natural environments Wohlwill
result humans innate tendency pay attention respond positively natural_elements Ulrich_al
predisposition prefer natural_elements man-made objects may explanation stress-reducing_effects nature
might thus hypothesized natural_elements affect feelings_stress perceived_attractiveness environment

significant level nsnon-significant
established previous research Ulrich Diette al
explanations effects nature mainly sought evolutionary theory Ulrich_al states humans natural tendency prefer natural_elements man-made objects Kaplan
However knowledge mechanism exposure nature may reduce feelingsof stress hadnever empirically studied
experiment showed stressreducing effects nature caused perceived_attractiveness hospital_room
result would mean basically making environment attractive healing_environments contribute health_well-being_patients
course numerous waysto improve attractiveness_hospital room example changing wall color
However people vary preference color Grossman Wisenblit therefore difficult design color scheme universally attractive
Since people generally prefer natural_elements use indoor_plants healthcare interiors thus seems straightforward effective way promote patients recovery
research indoor_plants healthcare_facilities focused health risks rather health benefits LaCharity McClure
Indoor plants potential source bacteria soil water may cause hospital-acquired infections although confirmed research Bartzokas al Siegman-Igra al
Clearly introduction indoor_plants hospitals needs closely monitored respect infection risks side-effects example limited working space medical personnel
Nevertheless healing potential indoor_plants overlooked
One might argue findings simulation experiment translated actual healthcare_settings
evidence available though photographs accurately simulate real environments studies show results similar field experiments Stamps Bateson Hui
Moreover exposure imaginary hospitalization photo hospital_room plants already capable generating clear effect may promising actual exposure hospitalized patients indoor_plants
Furthermore even effects appeared moderation real healthcare_settings simple low-cost intervention may well highly cost-effective
current study employed simple design essentially testing hypothesis plants make hospital_room attractive attractiveness reduces stress
future_research evolutionary explanation given effects tested including information processing attention measures
also interesting know environmental_stimuli capable affecting perceived_attractiveness environment well whether pictures plants_hospital room could generate similar results
hypotheses obviously demand replication field experiments healthcare_settings real patients
Conclusions study confirms stress-reducing properties natural_elements built_healthcare_environment
Moreover sheds light underlying mechanism causing stressreduction
experiment indicates stress-reducing_effects nature interventions built_healthcare_environment result higher level perceived_attractiveness environments
Introduction Historically noise light infection_control primary focus health-care environmental design research
early s however research cluster physical dimensions initiated instead addressing mollication negative aspects environment switched focus creation reinforcement positive experiences
experiences designed allow one project oneself environment outside healthcare_setting typically less hostile nurturing space
focus new research common theme providing positive_distraction ability allow individual shift focus negative foci within health environment restorative aspects non-medical world
Several environmental psychologists addressed role positive_distraction relative human need preference
Clare Cooper Marcus Steven Rachel Kaplan Jay Appleton Roger Ulrich formulated theories regarding positive_distraction context areas specialization
example Roger Ulrich Theory Supportive Design cites three signicant factors help patients_family staff cope stress turn result improved health_outcomes increased sense_control access privacy social support access positive distractions
Environmental variables commonly known contribute positive_distraction art access_nature music
literature topics discussed following article followed design guidelines provide suggestions apply principles real environments
Literature review Artcolor Although art incorporated hospitals since early th century purpose changed
lieu preparing patients death serving increase donations works art serve address holistic approach medicine Acknowledgement role art healthcare_settings become mainstream discussions implications environmental intervention take place widely circulated medical journals art used positive_distraction choice genre eg modern primitive representational topic critical
Regarding genre Ulrich noted postoperative patients preferred representational pictures abstract works
Part response might associated topic portrayed images part associated color choice
Representational art tends incorporate subdued colors natural environment whereas abstract art often surprising color composition
Ireland Warren Herringer found anxious individuals prefer less saturated colors therefore color may contributor impact viewer
Environmental CompetencePress Theory implies individuals seek less challenging environments become stressed
one internal emotional stimulation increases stressed individual seek less stimulating external environment order balance overall experience
Zuckerman Ulrich McLaughlin noted abstract work often preferred high sensation seekers
would suggest representational work would preferred individuals seeking less stimulating environment
individuals healthcare_settings trying reduce intensity visual neonatal intensive_care_unit NICU stressful environment families_caregivers
Positive distraction means mitigating stress
review research reveals several factors physical_environment contribute positive_distraction prominent nature art music
Design interventions provide positive_distraction introduced NICU setting window views pleasant outside vistas soothing artwork ability listen music
Journal Perinatology SS
doisjjp Keywords positive_distraction design guidelines nature art music NICU experience achieve greater sensory control_environment might prefer representational work
Several abstract artists argued abstract art necessarily perceived negatively patients
research shows previous exposure art genre may inuence preference young children prefer one type other providing patients_families choices regarding art placed environment important consideration
Nature Kellert Wilson Steven Rachel Kaplan Roger Ulrich engaged intriguing discussions origin motivation associated nature term biophilia coined Dr Edward Wilson evolutionary biologist refers innately emotional afliation human beings living organisms Wilson suggests opportunity associate nature limited typical health-care settings biophilic impulses disrupted
Steven Rachel Kaplan suggest certain preferences nature pervasive human qualities signicant role human evolution
Good interactions understanding nature served enhance human survival Adjunct Kaplans theory preference directly related human perception categorization behaviors enable individual acquire information
According hypothesis nature views preferred provide information simultaneously enable viewer located safe predators vantage point
Dr Ulrich cites access_nature primary means distraction
Ulrich studied moderately stressed individuals found_positive feelings resulted individuals exposed nature scenes exposed urban scenes
Additionally Ulrich found exposure videos nature restorative urban scenes viewing stressful movie
Physiological measures included pulse skin conductance muscle tension heart period
People appear believe access_nature may affect health_outcomes
Olds conducted study workshop participants asked draw images spaces sick individual might go healed
Seventy-ve percent respondents drew scenes outdoors included nature elements vistas light animals beauty
presence windows extension concept access_nature
Windows may impact patient health_outcomes psychological condition Ulrich comparison post-surgical cholecystectomy patients found views trees opposed brick wall adjacent building resulted better patient progress less use analgesics shorter length_stay
another_study patients viewed nature pictures less postoperative anxiety nature curtains accompanying natures sounds resulted better bronchoscopy pain control impact windows attentional fatigue intensive_care_unit ICU nurses also studied Although opposition increase number windows may result concern increased construction costs McKahan gathered data indicating average savings considering decreases operational costs associated improved health_outcomes owing views_nature would high per_patient day
Windows openings exterior wall must considered size proportion
comparison window windowless hospital rooms Verderber found windows small distant high thought windows
windows may possible access natural_light may positive_impact
Residential sunlight found associated lower frequencies breast colon cancers Lowered average length_stay mortality found myocardial_infarction patients located sunny rooms Regarding interior spaces accommodate interaction nature Burnett Hamilton suggest providing space plants window seat
patient_rooms ground oor greenhouse space added adjacent room maintained exterior
Gardens primary opportunity provide access_nature hospital setting
Medieval hospitals often designed around courtyards ancient Greeks incorporated spas water elements among building types
use gardens contemporary hospitals less common st century
set post-occupancy evaluations hospital gardens conducted Cooper Marcus Barnes found people used gardens normally visited space least per day
vast majority went relax reported positive mood changes including spiritual experiences stress reduction
Pet therapy interaction animals patients healthcare_setting means positive_distraction form access_nature
Although opportunities pet therapy neonatal ICU NICU setting may limited several studies conrmed benets activity
Interaction pets found reduce perception pain improve perception quality_life Music Music may elicit psychoneuro-immunological response although conrmed
Several studies suggest music especially controllable reduce anxiety stress helps patients cope pain Music employed reduce stress mitigate noise several ICUs Routhieaux Tansik found music reduced self-reported stress levels ICU waiting rooms
regard infants studies impact music mother heartbeat conicting
presence music subsequent withdrawal music may actually complex implications
Standley Moore found rst day exposure music infants signicantly higher oxygen saturation levels effects diminished subsequent days
Furthermore babies exposed music signicantly depressed oxygen saturation levels music terminated
conicting information type music eg classical jazz pop alternative might appropriate healthcare_settings
Evidence environmental psychology however would suggest choice selection least important genre
One common characteristics patients_families lack sense_control
Choice music may enhance sense_control help achieve healthy state mind
Minimally music distraction distraction deects focusing negative aspects healthcare_environment considered

Sustainability imply resources restricted resource utilization subsidized
Bill McDonough McDonough Braungart described sustainability terms three E environment equity economy
last quarter century lighting industry dramatically improved energy ef ciency environment E life-cycle cost lighting economy E
Much less attention given equity E Lighting standards still set primarily terms illuminances lumens_per square meter lumens_per watt based upon implicit assumption value lighting characterized lumen
lumen however unrelated non-visual effects light circadian_system indirectly related perceptual system
particular current architectural practices adequately support fragile segments population

fact role lighting affects human perceptual circadian functions almost completely ignored standards
Arguably failure consider two human domain functions ignored many modern applications inherent exibility robustness human species
One segment construction equity E always seriously considered however healthcare applications
applications contain fragile humans lighting shown example demonstrably affect lives seniors premature infants
standards assist architects engineers supporting well-being fragile people
illustrate assertion article focuses sustainable lighting healthcare applications good lighting three human domains visual perceptual circadian best documented
BACKGROUND Bill McDonough McDonough Braungart described sustainability terms three E environment equity economy
environment E often associated sustainability movement lighting
Nearly every discussion sustainable lighting concerned often concerned energy efciency
Certainly energy efciency essential sustainability
equally important sustainable lighting cost effective serve needs building occupants
Sustainability support human endeavors waste natural resources profitable
cradle cradle sustainability three E must addressed
last quarter century lighting industry dramatically improved energy efciency life-cycle cost lighting
Much less attention given equity E sustainability triangle illustrated
Lighting standards still set primarily terms illuminances lumens_per square meter lumens_per watt based upon implicit assumption value lighting characterized lumen
However lumen derived narrow set experimental conditions relevant simple visual functions characterize visual responses important modern built_environments eg apparent brightness
Moreover lumen indirectly related providing perceptual information environment eg linear perspective denition unrelated non-visual circadian effects lighting help maintain entrainment many biological functions local time
Boyce Rea conceptualized three domains light affect people
illustrated
lumen relevant one three domains visual_system
LIGHT ISN VISION ANYMORE Light formally defined optical radiation nm provides visual sensation humans CIE
human eye photoreceptors convert radiant energy neural signals processing brain phenomenon called phototransduction
recently four types photoreceptors identified rods short middle long wavelength cones Rea
Rods allow us see night cones allow us see day discriminate details see colors
neurophysiology neuroanatomy human visual_system largely understood lighting technologies standards measurement devices applications based solely understanding Rea
Given recent developments science however important embrace fact light vision anymore
past decades much work done understand non-visual effects light human health_well-being Rea al

Light entering human eye transmitted several parts brain projecting visual centers
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell ipRGCs novel photoreceptor type retina discovered Berson al

ipRGCs central important non-visual response light retina notably regulation circadian_rhythms
world rotates around axis result creatures exposed daylight earth experience -hour cycles light dark
Biological rhythms self-sustaining oscillations set species-specic characteristics including amplitude phase period Moore-Ede al

Living organisms adapted daily rotation earth developing biological rhythms repeat approximately hours
called circadian_rhythms Latin circa dies day

Human performance health_well-being inuenced least three systems visual circadian perceptual
Circadian rhythms generated endogenously internal body constantly aligned environment zeitgebers time givers factors exogenous external body
mammals circadian_rhythms regulated internal biological clock pacemaker located suprachiasmatic nuclei SCN hypothalamus brain Moore-Ede al

SCN self-sustaining oscillator maintains daily activities weeks isolated cultured
SCN humans natural period slightly greater hours environmental_cues reset synchronize SCN daily ensuring organism behavioral physiological rhythms synchrony daily rhythms environment
lightdark cycle main synchronizer SCN solar day Klein al
reaches SCN via retinohypothalamic tract RHT
Although circadian_system shares receptors neurons retina visual_system retinal ganglion cells exiting eye visual centers different exiting eye circadian_system
Light well dark play important role regulating circadian_rhythms timing lightdark cycles profoundly important many behaviors well well-being
Light acute phase-shifting effect internal clock
Acute effects seen shortly light exposure
example takes ve ten minutes light suppress production nocturnal melatonin hormone produced night condition darkness McIntyre al

Acute effects also disappear soon light stimulus removed minutes dark nocturnal melatonin returns normal level
Phase shifting effects seen hours days light exposure
Light applied early part night delay clock example bed waking times occur later previous cycle light applied late night early morning advance clock bed waking times occur earlier previous cycle
light applied minimum core body temperature delay clock light applied minimum core body temperature advance clock
Minimum core body temperature typically occurs hours one wakes naturally ie without alarm clock Jewett al

addition impacting circadian_system light reveals many intersecting spatial planes make environment Paulus al

Architectural_features used provide information environment therefore improve navigation space Gibson
Light reveals visual information providing spatial reference self-position location obstacles within person surroundings
example removal visual cues closing eyes shown result increased body sway Paulus al
Turano al

Therefore lighting schemes reveal enhance architectural_features used aid navigation orientation built_environment
LIGHTING CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTING VISUAL CIRCADIAN SYSTEMS Light decomposed ve characteristic dimensions quantity spectrum distribution timing duration Rea al

light characteristics affect circadian_system differently affect visual perceptual systems
brief light needed impact circadian_system stimulate visual_system
Young people read book moonlight studies date able demonstrate moonlight suppresses nocturnal melatonin production shifts circadian phase
reading daytime photopic visual response maximally sensitive light nm yellow-green light circadian_system blue-sky detector maximally sensitive wavelengths near nm
visual_system fast response time
visual_system fully process light pulses short milliseconds
circadian_system slow respond requiring several minutes fully integrate light falling retina
Thus circadian_system seems completely blind brief bright lightning ashes night
Perhaps largest difference visual circadian systems associated time light registered retina
visual_system responds nearly time day night
However already mentioned internal clock reset forward phase advance backward phase delay depending timing light exposure
Finally added sensitivity circadian_system light appears change depending previous light exposures
example ofce worker stayed dim room day long suppress melatonin exposed given light_night would farmer experienced high outdoor light_levels day
circadian_system seems concerned contrasting night versus day absolute light_levels Herbert al

EQUITY OLDER ADULTS ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES NURSING HOMES age changes aging eye become noticeable visual capabilities decrease
inability focus objects close distances noticed particular age called presbyopia
one grows older less light reaches back eyes pupil gets smaller crystalline lens inside eye becomes thicker absorbing light
-year-old receives much light retina -year-old
lens also begins scatter light one ages adding luminous veil images retina reduces distinctness contrast objects vividness colors
age years chances age-related eye diseases greater
Common age-related problems cataract macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy glaucoma
Cataracts dark cloudy opaque areas parts crystalline lens
Macular degeneration refers neural damage central vision
Diabetic retinopathy occurs blood vessels feeding retina damaged regions visual eld lost
Glaucoma result much uid pressure inside eye cuts blood ow thus nutrition retina ultimately optic nerve

Surveys indicate percent oldest members population years old suffer chronic sleep disturbances Van Someren
general older_adults tend go bed earlier evening wake earlier morning younger adults
Frequent nocturnal awakenings difficulty falling asleep increased number naps day also common oldest adults
Sleep disturbances associated decreased physical health including increased cardiovascular problems disruption endocrine functions decline immune functions Van Cauter al

Many physiological changes implicated circadian rhythm disturbances found older_adults

USING LIGHTING PROMOTE EQUITY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES NURSING HOMES Although everything known effects light health_well-being seems reasonable information available today provide -hour lighting_scheme maintains circadian_entrainment much possible promoting good visibility waking_hours safe navigation night
Following logic lighting assisted living facilities nursing_homes provide high_circadian light_stimulation day low circadian_stimulation night good visual performance eg reading waking_hours low-level nightlights enable safe movement space minimize sleep disruption
Guidelines lighting aging circadian_system Proposed dual lighting_scheme maximizes circadian_stimulation day minimizes night maintaining good visibility time Figueiro press
evidence suggests high_circadian stimulation daytime waking_hours probably achieved lx cornea K cool-white light_source
evening waking_hours lighting system provide lx cornea white light low energy short-wavelength region spectrum
Relatively dim ambient evening light provided light_sources K warm-white compact uorescent lamp CFL
dual lighting system provides older people daynight circadian_light ratio
High circadian_stimulation day low circadian_stimulation evening achieved using combination daylight electric light_sources
Daylight certainly effective light_source regulating circadian_system
Outdoor lighting ideal quantity spectrum distribution timing duration assumed daylight buildings always provide people suitable circadian_light pattern
quantitative analysis daylight space carefully made amount daylight varies considerably throughout building
Daylight levels room drop quickly distance window increases daylight levels quite low three four meters away window even sunny day Bullough al

also noted sunlight window penetrates room discomfort glare may cause occupants draw blinds shades eliminating daylight entirely space
Since assumed daylight buildings always going solution circadian_entrainment electric light must always considered
order select efcacious light_source circadian_system assessment relative circadian effectiveness different spectral power distributions SPDs emitted common electric light_sources performed using model human circadian phototransduction developed Rea colleagues Rea al

Ambient features comprise lighting noise_levels odours temperature
Another classication introduced Rice al
subdivides physical_environmental features either purely stimulus objects interactional objects
illustrated following example plants interior_design feature may serve stimulus objects patients passively exposed ie
visually whereas become interactional objects soon patients actively involved taking care
example also shows features classied categories depending applied
review restricted purely stimulus objects
Psychologically mediated effects general two ways stimulus objects impact health_well-being_patients
First direct physiological inuence meaning effects mainly unmediated unmoderated psychological processes Taylor al

example carpeted oor contains microorganisms vinyl oor Anderson al
may therefore direct physiological inuence patients health causing infections
Second environmental_stimuli may act psychological processes result sensory perceptions
processes cognitive emotional nature
instance presence_plants hospital bedroom may give patient homely feeling resulting less anxiety turn may promote recovery
review restricted second category processes
However several stimuli inuence health directly well mediation psychological processes
Carpeted oors instance may aforementioned direct physiological effect also indirect effect providing homely ambience improving acoustic conditions
ambivalent cases studies_included outcome_measures indicative psychologically mediated effects
Taking example carpeted oors thus included studies outcome_measures arousal calmness excluded studies measuring number respiratory infections

Results review Three relevant dimensions environmental_stimuli distinguished namely ambient architectural interior_design_features

Stimuli colour art plants gardens carpeting room_size studied isolation environmental_stimuli stimuli manipulated simultaneously combination several others

Conicting results also demonstrated social behaviour effects_found clinical_outcomes

Moreover conicting results social behaviour also show renovation may negative consequences specic types patients therefore planned carefully
Nine included trials studied ambient features
Positive effects_found several ambient features convincing results exposure sunlight
However specic effects appeared highly dependent characteristics patient population
Designers thus prudent using ndings design_healthcare environments
six trials studied architectural_features showed inconsistent effects positive_effects clinical psychological outcomes statistically non-signicant outcomes several measures
Methodological aws trials moreover impede drawing causal inferences
example reported effects windows may confounded varying amounts daylight content view considered
Isolated interior_design_features researched four trials
Adding natural_elements caused slightly positive_effects
Seating arrangements effects social interactions television set improve waiting experience
general interior_design_features available_evidence limited
Although interior_design_features involved several multiple_stimuli trials difcult attribute positive_effects trials specic features
Remarkably previously conducted reviews included types evidence tended draw considerably favourable conclusions respect power healing_environments review

Recent ndings Features hospital_design linked patient_safety literature include noise air quality lighting_conditions patient_room_design unit layout several interior_design_features
features act latent_conditions adverse_events impact_safety outcomes directly indirectly impacting staff working conditions
Others act barriers adverse_events providing hospital_staff opportunities preventing accidents occur
Summary Although evidence linking hospital_design patient_safety growing much left done area research
Nevertheless evidence reported literature may already sufcient positive_impact hospital_design
Keywords adverse_events architecture hospital_design patient_safety physical_environment Hospital design however considered isolation regard patient_staff safety
almost safety situations hospital_design interacts host factors culture organization tasks processes place tools technology
paper primarily focuses role hospital_design recognizing contributing role played critical factors
Direct impacts patient_safety Aspects hospital_design air quality lighting patient_room_design interior_design elements directly impact_safety outcomes nosocomial_infections patient_falls medical_errors
Air quality nosocomial_infections Airborne infections spread dust pathogens released hospital construction caused contamination malfunction hospital ventilation systems
Studies hospitals show fungal load air may linked humidity temperature construction activity
High-efciency particulate air HEPA lters highly effective preventing airborne infections hospitals
Air contamination least laminar airow rooms HEPA lters approach recommended areas operating-room suites ultraclean rooms immunocompromised patients
Yavuz al
found lower rates sternal surgical site infections newer operating rooms laminar oor ventilation systems automatically closing doors compared older operating rooms standard plenum ventilation doors close properly
Single bedrooms nosocomial_infections Ulrich_al
identied studies linking number_patients room nosocomial_infection rates
European Prevalence Infection Control Intensive Care study reported odds ratio infection intensive_care_units ICUs beds compared fewer ve beds
study however report ndings related open versus closed rooms
Mullin al
reported decrease Acinetobacter baumanii mechanically ventilated patients moving unit enclosed open patient_care areas one private_rooms
general reported evidence shows single-bed patient_rooms high-quality HEPA lters negative positive pressure ventilation effective preventing air-borne pathogens
evidence also shows multibed rooms difcult decontaminate surfaces act reservoir pathogens
basis study ndings American_Institute_Architects Guidelines Design Construction Healthcare Facilities adopted single bed room standard new construction United_States
addition several professional scientic bodies United Kingdom United_States Europe published ICU design guidelines include similar design measures control nosocomial_infections
Lighting conditions patient_outcomes large body literature reports different psychological physiological effects lighting hospitals may directly related patient_safety
example ICU psychosis adult patients partly attributed bright constant lighting_conditions ICUs lack nightday cues
similar phenomenon described among children pediatric ICUs
addition mortality rate may higher dull patient_rooms sex differential effects
Furthermore poor lighting_conditions may negatively impact physiological developments among infants
studies suggest lighting_conditions considered carefully design_patient care areas hospital
Lighting conditions medical_errors Performance visual tasks gets better light_levels increase
Buchanan al
found errors dispensing medications high volume outpatient pharmacy signicantly lower illumination level foot-candles opposed baseline level foot candles
Alaska Roseman Booker found medication_errors among hospital workers occurred rst quarter year daylight hours less
Studies ofces indicated importance appropriate lighting levels complex tasks requiring excellent vision study reported hospitals
Noise hospitals patient_outcomes Noise levels hospitals higher World Health Organization recommendations
level noise ICU ranges dB peaks dB
Parthasarathy Tobin reported arousals awakenings among ICU patients related noise
argued sleep disruption induce sympathetic activation elevation blood_pressure may_contribute patient morbidity
ICU psychosis adult ICUs pediatric ICUs also partly attributed high level noise areas
Common sources noise hospitals may include telephones alarms trolleys ice machines paging systems nurse shift change staff caring patients doors closing staff conversations patients crying coughing
Cropp al
counted different audio signals respiratory critical_care unit
Ten critical alarms requiring immediate nursing action whereas others require immediate action unnecessaryIt clear patient_safety relates hospital noise easily improved proper design management measures place
Hospital design_patient falls report Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations cited physical_environment root cause patient_falls studies shown contradictory evidence topic
recent review meta-analysis randomized_controlled trials nd evidence independent effectiveness environmental modication programmes patient_falls
studies however shown patient_falls occurred patient_room bedrails design element linked strongly falls
studies shown comprehensive multi-intervention strategies include environmental modications could effective reducing falls
Among specic interior_design elements ooring contribute incidence falls severity injuries upon impact
Donald al
reported fewer falls geriatric patients vinyl oors compared carpeted oors rehabilitation ward
study lacked sufcient power however
Healey hand reported patients suffer injuries fall vinyl oors compared carpeted oors
Simpson al
reported suboors may impact injury falls risk fracture lower wooden suboors compared concrete suboors
Impact environment staff working conditions poorly designed physical_environment creates latent_conditions staff stress fatigue annoyance burnout lack handwashing compliance may potentially lead adverse_events hospitals
Noise hospitals staff outcomes Studies shown noise strongly related stress annoyance among nurses noise-induced stress related emotional exhaustion burnout among critical_care nurses
Healthcare staff reported excessively high noise_levels work interfere work impact patient comfort recovery
Blomkvist colleagues examined effects changing acoustic conditions using sound-absorbing versus sound-reecting ceiling tiles group nurses coronary ICU
periods improved acoustic conditions many positive outcomes observed among staff including improved speech intelligibility reduced perceived work demands perceived pressure strain
convincing evidence noise latent condition errors hospitals strategies must adopted reduce noise
Variable acuity patient_rooms transfers Patients transferred one room another often three six times short stay hospital order receive care matches level acuity
Delays communication discontinuities loss information changes computers systems patient transfer may_contribute increased medical_errors loss staff time productivity
Hendrich_colleagues developed innovative demonstration project called Cardiac Comprehensive Critical Care Clarian Methodist Hospital Indianapolis address patient transfer associated errors
project provided different levels care single patient_room minimize patient transfer acuity levels changed
patient_room equipped acuity adaptable headwall nurses unit trained respond patients varying acuity levels
impact -bed variable acuity unit different outcomes measured comparing years baseline data move years data move
authors reported signicant postmove improvements many key areas patient transfers decreased medication_errors also drastic reduction number falls
path-breaking project demonstrated potential impact acuity-adaptable care dealing patient ow safety issues improving model care
Since project many hospitals across United_States adopted variations concept although impacts changes outcomes remain studied
Unit layout staff effectiveness Nurses spend lot time walking includes time locate gather supplies equipment nd staff_members
One_study found nursing_staff time_spent walking
came second patient-care activities accounted staff time
Unnecessary walking leads waste precious staff time adds fatigue stress among staff
Studies seem suggest bringing staff supplies physically visually closer patient may_help reduce walking
take advantage idea many hospitals incorporate decentralized nurses stations supplies servers next patient_rooms opposed locating everything single central location
Hendrich_colleagues argued layout may_help reduce walking supply trips
result nursing time may increase signicantly allowing reduction budgeted stafng care hours increasing time_spent direct patient_care activities
in-depth discussion various aspects unit design_patient room_design staff areas may_contribute staff effectiveness provided review best practice examples adult ICUs designed Rashid
Accessibility handwashing stations handwashing compliance Surface transmission pathogens accounts majority nosocomial_infections low handwashing frequency among healthcare staff generally key factor contributing problem
Design factors discourage handwashing include difculty access poor visibility poor height placement lack redundancy wide spatial separation resources used sequentially washing hands
Studies report conicting evidence effects physicaldesignonhandwashing complianceSome studies found handwashing compliance greater units higher sink bed ratios
One_study found signicantimprovementinhandwashingafteramovefrom open ward design layout single patient_rooms higher sink bed ratios
Trick colleagues found hand hygiene improved study period three intervention hospitals interventions included increased availability alcohol-based hand rubs interactive education programme poster campaign control hospital intervention increased availability alcohol hand rubs
studies seem suggest multistrategy intervention includes staff education well easy visual physical access sinks standard locations sinks patient_rooms comfortable sink heights alcohol-based dispensers may effective increasing handwashing compliance
Environmental barriersdefenses healthcare accidents environment potentially acts defense adverse_events providing opportunities staff families prevent accidents occur
Visibility patients One important way avert adverse_events related patients_staff ability observe patients continuously provide assistance needed
Multiple decentralized nurse work_areas charting alcoves next patient_rooms may_help facilitate activity
designs enable staff attend patients needs without delays
least one prospective study Hendrich showed falls cut two-thirds six per patients two per move old unit centralized nursing_station new unit decentralized observation units
Additional research_needed determine effects decentralization patient_safety
Visibility patients also seems related perceived safety
staff survey France al
new neonatal ICU pediatric critical_care unit children hospital designed single patient_rooms curtains privacy families larger unit size poor sightlines staff patients majority respondents believed facility_design made team communication patient monitoring difcult limited social_interaction among staff
Therefore making major facility changes critical take consideration patient needs privacy well staff needs monitoring communication
Presence family Another effective way avert adverse_events allow patient_family part patient_care process
order understand teamwork communication involving patient_family may_contribute patient_safety Uhlig colleagues conducted multidisciplinary collaborative rounds patient bedside cardiac surgery programme Concord New Hampshire
rounds also involved patient_family
team participated -min briengs patient bedside start day reviewed patient_care plan discussed medication addressed anything went wrong open blame-free environment
changes patient mortality rates declined signicantly
order include families active participants care process important provide spaces families patient_room unit spend extended periods time
Single rooms clear advantage multibed rooms regard result increased privacy
survey nurses four_hospitals found nurses gave high ratings single_rooms accommodating family_members accorded double rooms low scores
addition factors organizational policies limit family visitation hours may inuence family involvement satisfaction care
Conclusion Hospital design_may help improve patient_safety directly reducing nosocomial_infections patient_falls medication_errors sometimes even reducing patient morbidity mortality
Hospital design_may also help improve patient_safety indirectly reducing staff stress staff walking patient transfer improving handwashing compliance
contrast little reported recently role hospital_design barrier adverse_events hospitals
Although research links hospital_design safety increased past years still need focused studies
reported contradictions links also need resolved

UNDERSTANDING MINIMIZING LATENT CONDITIONS ACTIVE FAILURES Noise reduction report World Health Organization indicates noise interferes communication creates distractions effects cognitive performance concentration causes annoyance contributes stress fatigue
Mental activities involving demand working memory particularly sensitive noise result degradation performance
study Murthy al anaesthesia residents exhibited reduced mental efficiency poorer short term memory noisy conditions operating room averaging dB addition safety considerations noise affects quality healing_environment patients
may elevate blood_pressure increase pain alter quality sleep reduce overall perceived patient satisfaction
Studies paediatric intensive_care_units shown noise routinely disrupts sleep necessary patient comfort recovery nature sound reverberation rate long sound remains direct effect noise level
reverberation rate long greater opportunity sounds blend together increasing noise level

Wayfinding ability find one way without getting lost Passini Rainville Marchand
simple goal one stressful tasks hospitalThat wayfinding constitutes chronic problem health_care_facilities potentially affects staff time well organization bottom line evidenced multiple articles professional academic journals dating back th century see instance Del Nord O Neill Zimring
Wayfinding problems associated high blood_pressure increasedphysicalaggression andfatigue patients Carpman Grant
Furthermore Rousek Hallbeck argue aging population important also consider patients visual impairments designing wayfinding system
identified several design_elements involving signage pathstarget sites lighting flooring created navigation issues
effects wayfinding issues participants ranged tripping getting lost surrounding environment
unique needs elderly population emphasized study Lee Kline demonstrated younger subjects performed better wayfinding tasks elderly subject group
Although wayfinding acknowledged key concern health_care_facilities comprehensive studies designed environment health_care_facilities available published literature
Disparate studies identified environmental attributes influence navigation including visual configuration space signage landmarks architectural differentiation symmetry layout Ahn Baskaya Wilson Ozcan Carpman Grant Simmons
recently position paper published Center Health Design argues building blocks wayfinding system hospital put place master plan architecture interior_design finally facility amenities graphics signage
Based earlier work Passini Arthur whitepaper suggests person hospital looking destination relies five wayfinding factors Huelat knowing knowing destination_knowing route gets destination_knowing reached destination_knowing return
aforementioned literature provided two pieces key information navigation inside buildings entails multiple questions comprehending one knowing one reaches destination people seek information multiple environmental sources navigation inside buildings
contemporary hospitals designers hypothesize implement multiple strategies aid wayfinding personal experience authors
Since implementation design strategy associated capital cost expenditure existing literature lacks information design prioritization
capital projects upper limit available funds
typical across projects prioritize compromise among design strategies complete project within budget
strategies designers accord importance
associated issue important capital optimization well developing strategies across capital projectsisthewayenvironmentalcuesareprocessed human cognitive system
conceivable cues used short-term cognitive processing whereas others retained long-term memory
Seminal studies wayfinding urban environments complex navigation systems suggested concept mental maps cognitive_maps Lynch Siegel White
theories suggest people develop mental representations environment encounter better comprehend well navigate within
mental representations incorporate two types information survey-type information constitute skeletal information global scale route information context rich incorporate environmental_information local scale
Lynch suggested five types information get captured cognitive_maps people attempt make sense cities namely path streets sidewalks trails channels people travel edge perceived boundaries walls buildings shorelines district large sections urban area distinguished identity node focal points intersections loci landmark readily identifiable objects serve external reference points
Furthermore Siegel White asserted mental map constructed series mini-representations large complex environment
People use elements paths connect representations meaningfully

Signs maps definition provide vital information navigation destination
Architectural_features study defined visual_access exterior environments along multilevel interior environments essence vastly expanded visual_field subjects thereby providing crucial information regarding horizontal vertical_circulation systems well external clues via exterior signs possible internal routes targeted destinations
Signs first information_sought subjects

perspective alphanumeric nomenclature destinations also constitutes type sign
Thus subjects cognitiveprocessisactivatedwiththequestionpertaining meaning name destination appropriate sign type seek reach destinationThisiterative processofseekingmeaningfrom name alphanumeric nomenclature subsequently seeking appropriate signs repeated origin points
Data point cognitive processes involved developing global-level understanding three buildings intra-interbuilding circulation linkages
Supporting navigational_information
Environmental elements_attributes supporting navigational_information category played different type role cognitive process

Study data strongly suggest phenomena identifying anchor_points
Anchor points previously articulated several common attributes close external entrance point necessarily entrance used subject proximal location vertical_circulation multiple activities presence people presence maps signs
subjects navigated beyond anchor_points tended select pick elements visual environment familiarity_markers
process akin leaving pebbles one path woods rather using element sticks one memory like bread crumbs along path

Finally comparison studies settings wayfinding studies hospitals viewed special case
unlike settings people visit hospitals regularly generally high level stress anxiety
Study Limitations Five areas limitations evident
First subjects generally educated middle-class background
leaves considerable proportion patient visitor population analysis
second area limitation pertains using simulated_visitors opposed actual visitors
may asserted real visitors would experience higher levels acute stress anxiety may behave somewhat differently observed behavior study
despite investigators attempt induce level stress creating hypothetical scenario priming subjects
third limitation pertains obtaining subject review audio transcript
Since transcripts contained verbal_protocol opposed interviews transcribed verbatim reason believe subjects would disagree transcription
subject however could provided insight truly thinking point time
may argued since transcripts captured ongoing thought processes subjects may offer interpretations different thinking point time actually manage remember
cross checking interpretations primarily occurred among investigators
Fourth although sample_size simulated patients visitors appropriate qualitative exploratory study sample_size employees could havebeenlargerThat mayhaveprovided additional confidence kinds environmental_information employee use providing direction
Finally study_conducted one hospital
Multisite studies would provided greater credence study findings virtue larger sampling broad set circumstances
Future Efforts research opens series questions examination future studies
first pertains subjects
subject profile could expanded include people levels education income people proficient English well using actual patients visitors opposed simulated ones
Furthermore repetition study multiple health_care_facilities enable identification common themes provide greater credibility findings
associated issue examined pertains wayfinding challenges encountered staff
Perhaps typically assumed health_care staffs encounter wayfinding challenges since unfamiliarity facility issue initial days new employee
However context health_care United_States public private sector customary hire short-term rotating float nurses sometimes called agency nurses
nurses may familiar physical facility may experience level disorientation visitors family_members patients
Improper wayfinding could affect staff response time getting special medications getting equipment similar issues result affecting efficiency safety depending nature staff trip
type information_sought staff wayfinding may may different sought patients_family_members visitors impossible ascertain without empirical data
Furthermore several concepts phenomenon theoretical practical importance emerged study warrant examination include continuous evaluation subjects destination feature prediction creation use anchor_points familiarity_markers landmarks expanded definition landmark wayfinding building interiors
Finally crucial question pertains importance conceptual differences frequency_use usefulness importance among various sources environmental_information

Discussion Past research shown relationship elements hospital_design aspects physical_psychological_functioning adult pediatric_patients
Studies hospital_built_environment typically focused either variation single feature associated outcome considered built_environment_satisfaction outcome without considering actual health correlates
Guided conceptual model proposed Sherman_Shepley Varni purpose_study learn whether pediatric hematology-oncology unit built_environment_satisfaction varied exposure different built_environment_features determine whether objective_built_environment_features directly associated health_outcomes
additional goal determine whether perceived_built environment_satisfaction mediated relationship exposure objective_built_environment_features number outcomes
issues investigated two populations pediatric hematology-oncology_patients parents
Specifically investigated relationships among objective_built_environment_features perceived_built environment_satisfaction physical_psychological_functioning
Parental healthcare_satisfaction also evaluated
Relationship Built_Environment Built_Environment_Satisfaction Outcomes group hematology-oncology_patients significant positive relationship built_environment_features built_environment_satisfaction revealed
Thus although neither built_environment_features built_environment_satisfaction directly affected health_outcomes children studied findings support idea pediatric_patients respond differently different hospital_built environments
words pediatric_patients reported higher lower levels satisfaction built_environment depending quality built_environment placed
Several factors may contributed nonsignificance remaining paths children mediational model
First analyses may underpowered relatively small sample_size
None samples study met minimum sample_size recommended structural_equation modeling analyses Klem
However descriptive model fit indices indicated relatively good fit standardized path coefficients approached significant suggesting adequate power
also possible built_environment_satisfaction simply played role determining affect present functioning children
Given relationships identified built_environment child functioning hospital general built_environments Sherman_Shepley al third possibility present findings may lie context children hospitalization
demands hospitalization ie medical procedures blood draws side effects therapy anxiety related processes may obscured impact built_environment_satisfaction physical_psychological_functioning sick children
Although research new field ie impact hospital_design pediatric patient functioning yet established magnitude-of-effect sizes could expected built_environment manipulation important realize likely looking small effects
effects may small diminish importance
mean length_stay children study days hospital stays extending days patients persistent stress potentially life-threatening conditions
built_environment design incrementally improve physical emotional functioning patients benefit well worth obtaining
children parents built_environment_satisfaction also related objective_built_environment_features exposed greater satisfaction associated higher number built_environment_features hypothesized beneficial
Moreover parents mediational hypothesis supported objective_built environment associated built_environment_satisfaction turn associated parents satisfaction healthcare child receiving
Parents reported greater satisfaction child treatment medical providers happier hospital rooms elements hospital_design
Although data_collected cross-sectional therefore conclusions causality made findings consistent notion improvements hospital_built_environment may associated enhanced built_environment appraisal may_also contribute parents improved perceptions child healthcare given institution important measure consider increasingly competitive healthcare marketplace
findings consistent previous results convalescent hospital environment Varni_al
Distinct child model several factors found contribute parental well-being
support mediational model paths built_environment_satisfaction present functioning negative_affect emerged significant
suggests parents satisfied built_environment also felt better physically emotionally making positive changes built_environment could associated improved parental well-being
Given distress experienced parents pediatric cancer patients_reported literature eg Sahler al findings particularly important one considers extensive time parents spend patient_rooms child hospitalization
Although parents study reported varying degrees physical emotional functioning unlikely many parents physiologically compromised children
Perhaps difference health status enabled detection observed built_environment_satisfaction effect functioning parents children
words although already compromised health hospitalized hematology-oncology_patients vulnerable impact countless variables may difficult distinguish effects built_environment may easier detect built_environment impact parents normal health status nevertheless subjected vast amounts time hospital_built_environment
also possible built_environment effect functioning detected parents children increased statistical power given greater number parents participated_study
addition mediational relationships parents described path objective_built_environment_features one outcomes interest emerged significant direction opposite predicted
presence greater number built_environment_features hypothesized beneficial associated less positive_affect
Whereas complete presentation secondary analyses individual features beyond scope paper authors found small number beneficial objective environment_features ie thermostat bathroom patient side room bathrooms features significantly positively correlated number pain medications prescribed patients case thermostat controls nurse rankings severity reason hospitalization
Thus observed relationship positive objective_built_environment_features lower ratings parental positive_affect may driven variables related child health status
general systematic relationships observed patient health status room features
Limitations Future Directions novel field inquiry identifying appropriate constructs measurement terms built_environment_features expected outcomes iterative process refined time research
addition incipient nature research many instruments used yet tested validated
Although results demonstrate adequate internal_consistency reliability instruments English_Spanish research necessary establish validity measures determine best practices measuring objective_built environment perceived_built environment_satisfaction
Two additional problems may associated instruments used study
First although alpha scores generally adequate child parent measures child_self-report typically found less reliablethough still important obtainthan adult report
fact responses questionnaires resulted expected pattern relationships reached significance adult participants children may artifact self-report methodology utilized study
Second exclusive use self-report questionnaires measure hypothesized mediator well outcome_measures may contributed inflating relationships found constructs shared method variance
Future studies consider incorporation adult-proxy report corroborative information child functioning well physiological indicators stress
Another limitation study cross-sectional design
Although structural_equation modeling helps elucidate complex relationships among many variables causality established via experimental design one validly address question whether outcomes caused antecedent variables
Possible designs would bolster confidence causality might involve assigning children randomly rooms vary one feature eg natural vs urban view varying degrees lighting control full beds vs single beds parents lightweight moveable furniture allows eatingplaying together manipulating exposure feature across time eg changing artwork child hospital_room Eisen al
Simulation studies may_also help elucidate relationships built_environment_features eg room color pediatric_patients preferences outcomes Park
already mentioned hematology-oncology_patients study quite ill science medical treatment cancer blood diseases continues advance trend hospitalize critically_ill children
possibility detecting effect built_environment necessarily dwindles myriad physical psychosocial confounding factors importance providing optimal built_environment healing increases
challenge addressed refining measurement instruments identify physiological andor affective outcomes likely responsive built_environment changes
Given sample children able report satisfaction perhaps would appropriate future studies simply focus increasing pediatric_patients satisfaction built_environment
current study indicated moderate_levels satisfaction least satisfaction associated built_environment control
could targets future interventions
Another possibility identify less seriously ill groups children learn effect built_environment apply lessons built_environments sicker children families
Alternatively simulation studies eg Park could used generate specific built_environment hypotheses could tested actual built_environments
Hospital renovations expensive infrequent
Increasing research effects hospital_built_environment promote empirically supported hospital_design one way ensure funds put best use
Parents important stakeholders children hospitals terms children healthcare well functioning within built_environments
Thus important consider patient parents families well designing hospital_built environments
Parents important part study clear relationships built_environment_satisfaction parental mood satisfaction functioning
However models considered parent child experiences independently one_another
model combines parent child experiences richer possibly allow identification trickle-down built_environment effects child functioning better-adjusted parents
noted many children able participate study ageor illness-related limitations compromised capacity explore spectrum parent-child built_environment effects
ubiquitous presence families hematology-oncology units hospitals routinely include supplemental spaces floors including kitchens family rooms laundry facilities quiet rooms napping playrooms patients healthy siblings
areas could affect families feelings efficacy control caring child help provide homelike settings
addition spaces Child Life specialists common hematology-oncology units well music therapists teachers volunteers help children families cope hospitalization
Architectural design could promote hinder activities
study address supplemental spaces programs staff activities important areas addressed future_research
Likewise children possible immediate distraction entertainment front form art project Child Life musician pet therapist video game salient permanent built_environment fixtures eg bathroom amenities window_view incorporated future studies
Finally study generalizability findings limited
study sample representative population hospital conducted including large Latino population
Similar research_studies regions different populations needed determine whether findings representative cross-culturally

BACKGROUND article examines nurses daily care_critically ill_patients experience bed_space intensive_care_unit ICU
Research describes practice environment ICU part stressful thus tending increase risk burnout Epp Goetz al moral stress Gutierrez Wilson al emotional labour Stayt affects quality_care
built_environment design ICUs linked several factors signicance shaping nature critical_care practice
Previous research suggested among factors noise Blomkvist al walking distance unit size Seo al Yi Seo light Alimoglu Donmez Mroczek al performance obstacles related size equipment Gurses Carayon affect staff satisfaction work efciency
Boev proposed positive relationship nurses satisfaction work_environment patients_satisfaction care ICUs
Moreover design type ICUs affect patient_safety Bartley al Manojlovich al mortality Leaf al satisfaction Ulrich
Vouzavali al
Cypress suggest nurses patients ICUs reciprocal relationship
relationship deeply emotional nurses share patients_families suffering follow journey ICU
Beeby a_b describes complex character caring ICUs identifying two competencies technical emotional that need balanced incorporated care_critically ill
Academic debate arisen tension caring technology
Technologies make possible save lives simultaneously running risk objectifying patients technologies become paramount Almerud al Price observes caring ICUs separated technologies
However caring heart taking care patients bodies taking care practicalities involves concern empathic approach
Wilkin Slevin McGrath observe caring uncaring attitude ICUs matter suffering well-being_patients
focus aforementioned studies high-tech environment ICUs
None investigated meanings bed_space providing_care critically_ill patients ICUs
Bed spaces study refer physical place nurses patients loved ones reside
addition ICU world considered lived place space
AIM aim study explore nurses lived experiences ICU_bed spaces place care_critically ill
Among topics researched possibilities challenges nurses meet everyday care focusing bed_spaces whether environment affects nurses care way
ETHICAL CONSIDERATION According Swedish law Swedish National Board Health Welfare Eurecnet need formal ethical approval studies involve interventions collection personal data sensitive character involved capable giving consent
However conducting study ethical principles research outlined Helsinki declaration World Medical Association followed
Oral written information purpose_study research procedure voluntary consent provided prior process data_collection
Moreover approval obtained chief physicians every department anaesthesiology critical_care hospitals involved
METHODOLOGY METHODS purpose_study reective lifeworld research RLR approach outlined Dahlberg_al
chosen
RLR phenomenologically orientated approach
aims understand unfold hidden meanings lifeworld phenomena health_care contexts
Phenomenology builds upon rich philosophical heritage
Two broad orientations discerned namely descriptive interpretive phenomenology Finlay
Phenomenological inquiries attend study lived experiences meanings nature lifeworld phenomena
concept lifeworld central phenomenology
refers subjective takenfor-granted everyday world immediately lived experienced Husserl Moran Cohen
structure lifeworld closely intertwined encompasses intersubjectivity spatiality temporality mood embodiment Todres al
Another key concept phenomenology intentionality means phenomenon always understood something meaningful consciousness Husserl Moran Cohen
study nurses lived experiences bed_spaces intentional sense involved withintertwined care_critically ill_patients
intention study lived experiences caring alone however also meanings ICU_bed space place care
Thus bed_spaces become gural forefront research reveal meanings
Consequently drew nurses attention specically bed_space asked bed_space meant providing_care patients
achieved making nurses reect direct attention bed_space
Using reective lifeworld perspective entails searching essence phenomenon makes ICU_bed space
choice RLR approach locates study within descriptive orientation
order ensure scientic rigour quality study following aspects closely considered
First scrupulous adopting phenomenological attitude
achieved exercising openness meaning genuine understand phenomenon new way also implies ability surprised
Openness also means awareness inuence intersubjectivity generating data search meanings Dahlberg_al
thus called preunderstanding question prior process data_collection posing following questions experience phenomenon know know
want know Dahlberg_al p
discussed responses questions within research group
rst third authors trained ICU nurses second third authors experienced researchers within eld ICUs phenomenology
DATA COLLECTION Settings study_conducted one regional two university hospitals Sweden March September
three ICUs built s staffed trained nurses enroled nurses doctors one nurseenroled nurse always present bedside
ICUs university hospitals H respectively T-shaped placed within hospital buildings view buildings area
Bed spaces at headwall design window behind bed
beds separated curtains monitoring equipment placed head beds allowing direct visualization
ICUs accommodate multi-bed rooms two ve beds room numbers beds units range

nurses worked three shifts morning evening night
PROCESS DATA COLLECTION Data collected combining photographs qualitative lifeworld interviews Dahlberg_al Kvale Brinkmann
way collecting data conceptualized photovoice originally developed Wang Burris rooted educational feminist theory
ICU settings photovoice used purpose data_collection two_studies Olausson al Olausson al
participants asked take photographs bed_space capturing important providing_care anything associated particular feeling regardless feeling time excluding patients visitors
photographs taken digitally transferred laptop used aid reection interview used process analysis
photographs depicted detailed diverse range objects bed_spaces windows greenery technological equipment curtains chairs decor
in-depth open-ended interviews Kvale Brinkmann recorded digitally lasted approximately h conducted conversation room located within ward conference room vicinity
nurses asked relate experiences bed_spaces providing_care critically_ill patients using photos aid reection
interviews transcribed verbatim rst author
DATA ANALYSIS process analysis RLR involves backand-forth movement parts whole
analysis started reading interviews several times attempt understand grasp phenomenon whole
second phase focused search meanings text divided smaller segments referred meanings units
Example pictures taken participants
text studied reective dialogue open attitude meanings extracted carefully respect whole
meanings similar one_another brought together form primary patterns termed clusters
comprise initial structure phenomenon facilitate revelation essential meanings
clusters related order discover new whole essential invariant phenomenon providing broader understanding describing essential meanings phenomenon
essence phenomenon explicated identifying constituents describe nuances variations
entirely distinct one_another meanings described reference number constituents different nuances Dahlberg_al
follows essential structure phenomenon scrutiny described
FINDINGS Caring ICU_bed spaces means uncompromisingly call order assess critical illness strive continually preserve eliminate threats patients lives
also entails commitment strengthen recovery promote return life support families lifecrisis situation
However tension architectural interior_design bed_spaces aspects provide strength hope promote well-being critically_ill patients_families
bed_spaces constituted outer spatial dimension inner existential dimension
interaction dimensions simultaneously offers hinders possibilities provision care respite critical illness
nature care environment necessitates proximity staff critically_ill patients patients life-saving technologies
bed_spaces place encounter vulnerable_patients families staff
encounter characterized contrasting feelings concerning powerpowerlessness controllacking control
addition bed_spaces vary accordance physical condition critically_ill patients changing constantly taking different forms
following constituents elucidate essential structure phenomenon observing observed broken promise cherishing life ethical predicament creating caring atmosphere
Observing observed Observing patient means simply seeing seeing patient seeing critically_ill body seeing technology connected body
However simply eyes never enough nurses need tools conrm see reveal see purposes prediction
Lifesaving technologies thus ever-present element place technology identity denes place transforms critically_ill body something invisible something visible
like kit belongs bed_spaces


Otherwise place could anywhere


discover things m able see otherwise


really happy IP
Technologies also constitute safety security gradually become extension nurses bodies extended arms eyes
Feelings security safety may always prevail however accompanied uncertainty result tension knowing knowing
overview process analysis
Getting know data whole read interviews repeatedly knew exactly information came interview
reflected interviews whole tried understand grasp nurses saying bed_spaces
Clusters meanings parts text divided smaller segments meanings units
searched meanings parts dialog text
done asking questions mean

Could mean something else
know sure
done meanings emerged
meanings similarities brought together form preliminary patterns clusters
Searching essence new whole Clusters related abstracted form essence ICU_bed spaces essence illustrated constituents variations nuances ICU_bed spaces describing inner outer horizons concrete level
unpredictability generates atmosphere covers veil uncertainty
severity critical illness evokes feelings tension concern tying nurses patients sick beds
proximity sick bed necessary observation
patients recover room nurses perform nursing_activities distance sick bed without feeling worried
Feelings anxiety uncertainty also generated place hide gaze families sometimes patients
nurses left space withdraw every nursing activity takes place vicinity sick bed
Nurses need personal sphere order able think reect prepare nursing_activities bed_spaces
broken promise Feelings emotional strain near despair provoked nurses unable promote patients wellbeing design_bed spaces
thus entails inability keep promise providing_care care pays attention patient needs symptoms physiologically existentially
latter means meeting patients needs privacy security say much accept everything world tired


much noise moment come leave


feel sorry IP
Promoting patients well-being takes great effort sometimes experienced hopeless mission
architectural design also decisive space provided families extent participation care part patients lives ICU
example lack space fuels rivalry nurses families everyone needs wishes close proximity sick bed
Nurses aware strength affection love given sick person family time need space manage patient_care
evokes feelings_stress conict prioritizing nursing_tasks promotes patients feelings well-being
difcult close one eyes deny advantages patient_family bedside healing force able rest calm environment power nature patient recovery help patient maintain hisher strength
Moreover experiences lack daylight sometimes cacophony sounds bed_spaces drain nurses energy
patient needs attention care family needs attention comfort technology needs attention supervision different ways thus evoking nurses feelings good enough anybody anxiety losing control situation
Cherishing life Cherishing life means recognizing worries sorrows patients_families comforting trying bring attention possibilities moving forward life
example window_view nature outside balcony patients leave bed_spaces regarded possibilities focusing patients attention everyday life instead illness
features believed increase patients sense_control coherence motivate return life provide glimmer hope
open door get feel fresh air hear birds


sometimes need pep talk


home soon IP
Nurses maintain architectural design interior affect moods spirits subsequently way deliver care
Nurses need connected world outside order able nourish patient life care
Somehow nature life belong seeing nature strengthens life everybody bed_spaces source inspiration process care
window_view nature outside thus greatly desired
bed_spaces however embodied reected everyday work
Ethical predicament Caring critically_ill entails many ethical concerns
Nurses often reect frightening incomprehensible environment bed_spaces may patients especially often drifting consciousness lack privacy personal sphere
Feelings responsible protecting patients constantly present
Nurses difculty following ethical codes values however openness bed_space area nature exposure patients accept part cultural organizational issues care
know happening might think things hear patient next bed related
tell sometimes horrible things discussed IP
design_bed spaces gives rise conict observing maintaining patient privacy integrity
Sometimes nurses ashamed family multi-bed spaces chaotic
Patients pain dying patients layers noise technological equipment environment everybody see hear extent happening
Feelings letting patients_families generated particularly nurses fail maintain secrecy
daily work nurses experience hopelessness meaninglessness struggle space
simply room
lack space merely impact nurses feelings mood however also relates aspects patient_safety
Meeting needs patients_families difcult time ICU jeopardized turn puts ethical values caring risk
design_bed spaces major obstacle provision care meaning essence care practice care contradict
Creating caring atmosphere caring atmosphere means establishing trust
Nurses describe approaching patients curious interested attitude one way developing trust curious entails doubt thus generating reection resulting careful respectful way performing nursing_activities
think


person




look


hold hand talk gently ordinary things IP
Establishing trusting relationship also mirrored bed_spaces Nurses try make environment homely maintaining immediate surroundings sickbed using strategies minimize stressful environment
example lowering levels sound alarms prior activities normally trigger arranging technologies way allow patient remain focus
patient pictures personal items greatly valued makes bed_space specically patient bed_space general
DISCUSSION ndings shed light physical world around bed_spaces particular architectonic qualities vital nurses full caring practice
maintain poor design_bed space major concern caring giving rise ethical concerns inability keep promises patients regarding care likely strengthening already existing stress factors ICU practice environment
Gurses al
Gurses Carayon identied poor physical_environment major obstacle nurses daily work affecting patient_safety nurses workload thus nurses quality working life
Job satisfaction supportive healthy environments signicant nurses staying ICUs signicant future ICUs Alameddine al
Critical care management complex task requiring high levels competences skills nursing_staff also well-adjusted facilities Chambers Bowman Thompson al
interplay several aspects built_environment working space sound levels natural_light view together patients critical condition shaped nurses everyday experiences
However much ndings concern lack obvious necessary conditions facilitate nurses work
ability provide care humanistic way partially determined quality physical environments ICU
According Galvin Todres humanistic care concerned amongst factors togetherness uniqueness sense place
built_environment support humanistic care architectural level providing possibilities promoting well-being critically_ill families
example family area bed_spaces would mean families could stay together ICU without stealing space nursing_staff
provision calm private bed_spaces would mean maintenance secrecy integrity privacy ill person
also proposed previous research creation healing_environments Fontaine al Stichler Price Rashid Bazuin Cardon Chambers Bowman
urgent need translate research ndings practice order improve quality_care
design ICUs one difcult complex processes health_care settings dynamic nature ICUs continual advances therapies interventions Grenvik Pinsky
ICUs studied considered outdated facilities need renewal meet needs contemporary intensive_care
reasonable assume care provided outdated facilities affect nurses job satisfaction consequently care carried
study lack sufcient working space one major challenges nurses deal daily work generating great deal dissatisfaction hopelessness
feelings elements increasing risk burnout among nurses Epp
According Heidegger ontological structure being-in-the-world involves amongst aspects care space
Care means concern solicitude Heidegger p fundamental being-in-the-world existentially grounded willingness wishing
hectic unfriendly environment ICU awakens urge protect patient
Even though nurses utmost protect promote patients well-being partly fail design_bed spaces
generates concerns fully able provide genuine care would require able bring play every possibility helping patients_families move forward life
Nurses want able provide best care reduce patients suffering face obstacles struggles everyday work
use different strategies create caring atmosphere bring hope sick despite realities situation
Care separated nurses practice however separated takes place Nightingale observed bed_spaces centre nursing thus great signicance
Price notes caring ICUs complex phenomenon affected many factors norms culture settings organizational priorities arrangements
presence impact technologies environment ICUs unavoidable
Even though technology per se focus study see impact bed_spaces
Evaluating need technologies critical_care_settings relation patient condition important
ill-considered use technologies transform possibilities threat
bed_spaces become polluted noise heat technologies may take space renders ICU restricted space Kongsuwan Locsin
Galvin observes high-tech environment ICU neutralized way nurses care sick person
nurses study emphasized need close proximity patients need allow feel another human feelings order care empathically
Galvin Todres describe embodied relational understanding vital vulnerable_patients families
accord ndings Vouzavali al
emphasize nurse-patient relationship ICU spatial dimension patient becomes space nurses
physical_environment therefore support nurses care
architectural point view literature indicates need staff areas rest rooms outside bed_spaces Catrambone al
argue however need welladjusted bed_spaces include zone nurses allowing achieve balance proximity remoteness
STUDY STRENGTH LIMITATIONS ndings study provide dense description nurses experience critical_care_settings place care thus enrich understanding complex environment ICUs
Finlay proposes four criteria evaluating phenomenological inquiries rigour resonance relevance reexivity
achieved exercising openness reexivity whole process research following steps outlined Dahlberg_al

Calling pre-understanding question slowing whole process understanding allowed meanings emerge revealed
Photovoice methodology Wang Burris powerful way accessing personal meanings helping participants reect specically phenomenon study
study may lack sufcient resonance ie
artisticpoetic dimensions phenomenological description Finlay
Moreover study three ICUs one country ndings may provide comprehensive picture ICU settings general
many ICUs elsewhere working creating healing_environment adopting best practices
Another limitation study considered nurses perspective
sample including health_care staff would probably provided richer description
addition gender variation Polit Beck limited one male nurse participated
CONCLUSIONS IMPLICATIONS study three ICUs one country ndings suggest need future_research pay attention ICU settings organizational level
Policy makers leaders responsible quality_care responsibility extended built_environment bed_spaces ICUs
Moreover need ask actually charge ICU environment built
thus need policies support optimize environments ICUs
Comparative qualitative studies examining meanings bed_spaces providing_care ICU settings need conducted order get clearer picture
ICU staff_members need involved process planning designing ICUs incorporate perspective planning process highlighted Gregory
Finally creating optimal environment ICUs ethically challenging matter

Supportive spatial features include straight circulation system visual_access relevant places integration meaningful reference points
Environmental Attributes order create pleasant environment positively affects outcomes residents dementia informed design environmental attributes lighting acoustics room_temperature use colors contrast pat terns necessary
Among environmental attributes impact light outcomes_people_dementia investigated
However results conflicting

Associations improved behav ior well also established confirmed studies
Also may positive correlation bright_light therapy cognition
Lighting sources simulate daylight tested studies yield desired results
Adequate general lighting however may lead decreased disruptive behavior
higher luminance level improve vision example dining table might effective residents functional abilities oral intake
Therefore providing sufficient lighting one key architectural efforts care_environments people_dementia

comfortable room climate may_contribute improved behavior well residents
visual impairments frequently found older_adults therefore also found people_dementia need considered design
evidence shows residents benefit informed application colors including strong color contrast
However caution necessary using patterns dark lines flooring may found confusing even cause falls
Ambience Offering residents environment insti tutional design homelike appearance allows individual transformations positive_effects behavior well social_abilities care_outcomes
Among results residents found display fewer behavioral disturbances experience higher quality_life interact staff

Therefore effects observed may_also result combination environmental orga nizational interventions
Still homelike personalized envi ronment provides frame less institutional care routines thus beneficial people_dementia care homes
example studies suggest homelike dining atmosphere char acterized residents dining unit small group dining_room familiar mealtime routines residents serving results improved eating behavior communication
environment needs provide sensory_stimulation visual auditory tactile olfac tory stimuli

Environmental_Information Visual cues support ability people_dementia orient them selves
Effective cues identified signposting room numbers col ors
However type design cues great importance
Signs instance contain icons text
personalization cues found especially supportive
Nameplates portrait-type photographs personal memorabilia placed outside rooms help residents locate room
Visual barriers camouflaged doors door knobs effec tive reduce attempts people_dementia leave facility may even increase well
Strengths Limitations review summarizes broad spectrum research field design people_dementia
wide_range studies different methodical approaches found necessary provide guidance studies credibility
approach chosen done assessing studies quality rating study design
results visual ized using matrices offer overview interventionoutcome relation ships evidence_level
way architects designers guided developing designs based current systematically acquired appraised evidence
However review also limitations
wide_range heterogeneous methodical approaches study qualities appraisal studies quality focused mainly study design
way aspects determine methodological quality study thus credibility outcome questioned
However study design seen indicator methodical quality study
Conclusion Results review paper show impact characteristics built envi ronment care homes residents dementia

However progressive cognitive decline key characteristic dementia
Thus tracing back changes resident dementia cognition environmental_characteristics may provide methodological challenge
evidence-based approach takes methodological quality studies reviewed account also shows well researched specific interventionoutcomes relationships
visualizing relationships matrices becomes evident field dementia design well researched many aspects
However also gaps either result conflicting study outcomes whether daylight control impact outcomes_people_dementia represent less researched aspects use sensory environ ment
